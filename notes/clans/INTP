#NOTES

Welcome.~
Sval~
Welcome to the clan.  Reading this means you have already figured out the
clan noteboard and ctell.  The only thing then remaining is the fact that
you should watch this board as amendments to the charter will be listed
here.  We try to keep restrictions and rules to a minimum so there
shouldn't be too many.  Again, welcome to the clan.  If you have any
questions look me up or ask on ctell.
