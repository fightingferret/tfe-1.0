#NOTES

Welcome~
Morhion~
Welcome to the Thorns.  We will work on living a nice *coughrichcough*
life and have fun.  :) 

Okay, basic rules time:
*Loyalty--Your in a family now.  If a clannie is in trouble or needs you
badly and you are in a big shot group, suck it up and get helpin.

*Secrecy--Unlike most clans we dont advertise ourselves.  If someone asks
"hey what ever happened to the Thorns?" One answer can be "We're still
workin on setting it up", nice and to the point.

*Internal stuff--Ive been in clans fer a looong time.  Sometimes there
are bound to be different perspectives.  If you know you are 100% right
on an issue, dont just assume the rest will understand..xplain yourself
and listen to the ideas of others.  If you have a problem with another
clannie, dont keep it in and hold a grudge.  Post yer problem or talk it
through.

I bet i missed some, ill put em up as i remember them.  Some of you might
say "well duh, these rules are obvious".  Trust me for some they are not.

Teams~
Morhion~
Okay we are dividing into teams....green and blue.

Green team--lead by Drog will be in charge of research and a bit of
development hehe.

Blue team--lead by me is in charge of overall nastiness.

If it helps ya can think about it this way..green team researches the
gun, how to use it.  Blue team is the bullet.

Fund..~
Morhion~
For i forget, we dont have a fee like some clans do.  Clan treasury is
all on a donation basis.  Course if you want a nice home to come back to
when yer done being evil...itd be nice if ya dished out a nice percentage
of yer income :P 
Team members can give their donations to their respective team leaders.
