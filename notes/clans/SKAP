Level limit for clan~
Malhic~
I would like some input as to a good level limit for the clan.  Currently
I'm going with half my level.  I like this idea because it keeps the
level limit riseing with the average level of the clan.  This might need
alittle adjusting, something like my level - 5 or something like that. 
Let me know what you think.

Map~
Malayne~
I have an almost 3000 room map of all the main roads, lower level zones,
and towns.  If you'd like a copy, I'd be happy to email it to you.  Just
send me an email at: taeneth@@jymis.com 

I made it using zMud version 5.22.  I'm not sure it will work with
earlier versions.

Me and Malayne~
Taeneth~
Just to make things clear about my multiple personalities:

* I prefer to play Taeneth, but I'm happy to play Malayne if we need
damage more than healing.  I'd rather have a group than none, if I'm a
deciding factor.

* If I'm logged on with Malayne, I'm probably either messing with socials
or mapping.  That means I'm engrossed in what I'm going or switched and
can't even see ctell, so be persistent and send me tells to get my
attention.

Just want y'all to know how to deal with me, and if I am ever annoying
with the multi's, please tell me.

kick the doggy~
Grude~
I have recently aquired a new pet.  He is a street mutt.  Please don't
play kick the doggy with the street mutts, it maybe him.
My dog is kinda stupid and tends to wander off sometimes, so if you see a
mutt hanging out, its probably him.  He goes by the name rocket, and does
tricks for food.  Well food for his owner.*grin* 
Thanks,
GRUDE

I Like saul.  He's a troll.  We should have more trolls in the clan.

Griffin Tgar~
I also have a pet.  He is a lizard.  He name is Fred.  His favorite place
to hang out is in pennan.  He loves the docks.  He gets lots of bugs on
the docks.  If you see a lizard by the docks, pat him, for that is Fred.

alts.~
Haart~
I agrees with snog, if we allow all are alts in we have a clan of 100
people

Alts~
Snog~
I think we should limit the clan in that you can have one of your
characters in it or the other.  Having a clan full of alts does not
appeal to me.  Thats my two cents.  I see it as having a person in the
clan and a second person in the clan for a group.  The alts should also
not be automatically let into the clan but instead go through a process
if we do allow them in as we are now.  I don't care for the way it is
currently and am voicing my opinion.

ps, if ya wanna talk to me about this do it over ctell.

Re: Alts~
Malhic~
Well, at first I agreed with you (in the old skap) and that was a rule of
mine.  No alts, and for much the same reason, clan size.  But since then
I gave it some thought.  I mean, its not like people with alts are going
to play both characters at the same time.  Only one would be on at any
given time, and just because I only play one character I didn't want to
limit those who had time or energy to play more than one.  Its all about
friends and being able to readily get ahold of them.  Its not like we are
roll players (I know "gasp").  I mean I don't want the clan to get real
huge.  But we already know these people with one character, don't see
that point of them being on, but not available to what the clan is talkin
about.  Not sure if I'm getting my point across, but if you guys want to
get rid of alts, I'm all for what the clan wants to do as a whole.

brains to make the oddly-shaped hat.  If you are wondering what it does,
its: 
- +1int
- +10mana
- ac of 3
- base cost of 9pp
- min-level 30
- And has helped me get prac points

That alt thing~
Kharnez~
I tend to agree having more than one character in a clan is a bit
redundant.  Right now i'm a bit burned out on playing a mage and felt I
needed to do something differnt to keep me interested.  I do have goals
for both my characters but never really intend to play the paladin to any
great lengths.  If it truely offends anyone I will leave with no harsh
thoughts on the matter.  I miss being able to chat away to you all when
I'm playing my alt and that is the main reason i asked malhic if he
minded me joining with Kharnez while my main character is still active.
