Welcome to the League Of Three Nations!~

Hi, and welcome to the League.  Make yourself at home, this will
hopefully be a clan where we can relax and enjoy each others company and
ignore the whole levelling quickly nonsense.
I may as well put down a few basic ground rules not mentioned in the clan
charter (Hah, think that thing listed all yer jobs?) and list things you
should do, and things you really should know better than be doing.

@B * @n Do not aid Orcs unless you have a really good reason.  Theyr
enemies of each of our three races and the biggest menace to our tasks.
@B * @n Please aid each other in many ways, yet don't feel you need to
level someone, or always group with ourselves.
@B * @N Have fun dammit!  We're gonna make this world rumble and fear our
feet and bad jokes.

At present a clan Stronghold is distant, but not asfar as you may think. 
With a minimum of ten members, we only need 30 plat per member and I know
we will have more than ten members, so it should not be hard to make it.
We plan to either A) build it in the mountains just around the corner of
kha-da, or with extreme dogginess, in the mountains near the Frost gians
or in the Halfling village.

Well, not really much to say thusfar.  Planning to have Belgar as Dwarven
liason, Humfrey as Gnomish liason and Jaime as the Halfling liason. 
Sides from all that, have fun, and i'll see you all around.  ;) 
Derek the Cleric of the silent Jay.
