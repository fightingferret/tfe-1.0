The Foyer~
A small puddle lies here at the foot of the earthen wall from which the
cavern emerges.  Surprisingly, a breathtaking, cavernous rotunda extends
from this small entrance as far as the eye can see.  Appearing to bound
at infinity, the domed ceiling arches upwards into dancing shadows
eminating from the sparse flicker of firelight.  Intricate designs that
adorn the surrounding walls moving in a hypnotic pattern as the faint
lights cascade over their surface.  Shimmering from high overhead, an
enormous, majestic bronze banner glares down ominously upon all who enter. 
A deathly silence devours this room save for the soft footsteps forever
echoing from the marble floor, and the distant dripping echo of an
unknown liquid forming pools in the darkness.

earthen~
The southern wall is made entirely of moist, dark earth, and is covered
in creeping vines which cling to its surface and extend upwards into
blackness.  The large hole, cut into the earth above, looks well beyond
the reach of anyone trying to enter from below.  earth above your reach.
~
E
up ceiling~
Squinting in the faint light, you manage to make out the darkest heights
of the rotunda.  Judging the distance to be approximately 50 feet, you
begin to realize how far below the earth the cavern lies.
~
E
shadows~
The shadows dance around you menacingly, as if to warn you of some
terrible danger residing in this place.  One shadow is your own,
stretching out behind you and spilling against the earthen wall, greatly
exaggerating your size.  An intense feeling envelops you that you are
being watched...  perhaps by the shadows themselves.
~
E
bronze banner~
A large, rectangular field of solid bronze glares down from on high. 
Forged in the bronze is the image of a gloved fist holding a globe of
darkness.  The details visible in the forging are incredible, making the
hand seem to clench the darkness within tighter as the lights cause the
shadows to dance along its surface.
~
E
marble floor~
The floor is made entirely of exquisite marble.  Though colors are
distorted and unclear in the lighting of the rotunda, you can see the
elaborate crimson swirls against an ivory background...  the origin of
such rare stone a mystery.

Great Hall~
Dim, yellow light given off by flickering torches placed at intervals
along tapestry-hung walls and radiant heat drifting from the maw of a
massive stone fireplace lend a cheery warmth to the vast hall, its upper
reaches melting into the gloom of a raftered ceiling looming high
overhead.  Within the heart of the room, bearskins blanket the cold stone
floor, while randomly placed about the hearth, comfortable chairs provide
a place for study and conversation, several tables close by piled high
with ancient tomes of knowledge.  At key points high upon the stone-laid
walls and flanking a long, oaken trestle table, various articles of war
hang proudly as though unseen guardians hold them still.  Poised
majestically above the fireplace, passing judgment upon all those within
its gaze, the red-hued statue of a large dragon emerges from a shallow
alcove in the wall.  Several arched passageways lead off from the main
hall, and facing the hearth a heavy, iron-banded door of age-darkened
wood offers exit to the forest beyond.

weapons war~
Glinting in the flickering torch light, various weapons of war draw the
attention...  large metal shields, mighty battle axes, maces, hammers,
and a wide variety of deadly blades wrought in iron and steel, each
polished to a shine, but maintained in whatever state of damage their
final battle left them.
~
E
tapestry~
One particular tapestry catches the eye...  stitched in some distant,
misty past, the fine detail and the still-bright colors mark it clearly
as a masterpiece.  Depicted therein is a dragon, massive in size, golden
scales glinting brightly, graceful translucent wings idle and folded
along his sides.  The great wyrm is coiled around a treasure hoarrd, his
enormous head at rest atop the pile.  His razor-sharp teeth are bared in
a parody of a smile as he contemplates the objects held in each taloned
hand - in one an antiquated suit of adamantine armor, in the other a tome
of ancient and arcane knowledge.  By some trick of light or artistry his
glowing red eyes seem to follow each of your movements, as if determining
your worthiness.
~
E
dragon statue~
With an aura of wisdom and the stance of a predator, this stone-wrought
dragon gazes calmly across the hall.  Its right claw curls possessively
over the mantle of the fireplace, talons of untarnished stell gleaming in
the light of the flames from below.  Upon each side of the dragon's broad
head rest two large, expertly crafted gems...  deep crimson eyes that
glow faintly as though light flowed between them.
~
E
fireplace~
The heady aroma of burning logs teh size of small trees drifts from the
cavernous maw of a stone fireplace that covers the entire wall opposite
teh door.  Fire-blackened, a pot filled with a savory mixture hangs from
a hook poised over the white-hot coals, the small bubbles of a slow
simmer rising and bursting on the surface.  Spitted upon an iron rod,
casually turned by a passing hand, the haunch of some slain beast
crackles and pops as melting fat drips into orange-blue flames.  Warmth
radiates from the blaze, filling the room with a cheering warmth.

Before the Gates of a Massive Stone Keep~
Rising up directly to the north of here are the massive black obsidian
stone walls of an enormous keep.  Four towers can be clearly seen resting
high atop the battlements of the keep, each capped with a large banner
which ripples in the constant breeze.  Set into the center of the stone
wall is a massive wooden gate covered in thick iron bars.  Attached on
each of the of the gates are shields with a silver dragon etched onto
their surface.  Hanging on each side of the gates are two torches which
flicker with an unnatural greenish flame, illuminating the entire path to
the keep.  To the south a small footpath works its way back onto the sea
trail.

image of a large red dragon soaring across a full moon.  Paintings of
fully-armored knights adorn the western wall each with the name of one of
the clan's members.  Upon the northern wall lies a large marble archway

Within a Large Obsidian Chamber~
Save to the north, the walls of this chamber glisten midnight black, the
mirrorlike sheen of polished obsidian.  The dull red-orange glow of a
lava flow flickers across the surface of the walls, illuminating the room
with the haunting hue of the setting sun.  The north wall is rough, the
wall of a natural cavern.  However, looking closely to the wall you can
see that it hides a door built into the rock.  A massive staircase carved
into the rock leads up to another large chamber.

A Massive Hall of Shadow and Obsidian~
The dark recesses of this massive hall are draped in shadow.  The
mirrorlike surface of the polished obsidian walls absorb the glare of
intruding light.  Dark banners hang from the smooth stone ceiling,
emblems of war and heralds of destruction.  Arches lead out of the
chamber to the east and west, while a stairway of stone leads down into a
chamber which glows red and orange.  In the center of the room, a
majestic fountain in the likeness of a watchful gargoyle stands guard
over the hall.

Before a Shadowy Fortress~
Fog from the Northern Sea lies heavily on the flagstone road that leads
to this drawbridge.  Vines and moss cover the stone rampart that prevents
the unwary from stepping north, off the embankment and into the vast sea.
Standing where the flagstones end is a waist high marble pedestal.
Looking west the view is blocked by an immense mist enshrouded
fortress.  Separating the road and the fortress lays a deep ravine, from
which you hear the sound of fast moving water.

A Smokey Flagstone Courtyard~
Gray smoke drifts from several cooking fires adding a ghostly dimness to
the air.  The smell of some soup or stew reaches you from a large black
pot above one of these fires.  On the east side of the courtyard is a
drawbridge with a lever next to it.  To the west is a damp passage
angling down into the cliff side.  Hanging next to the passage is an iron
ring suspended from a chain.  To the south is an archway leading inside
the fortress.  Racks of weapons and armor give this place an air of
readiness and confidence.

Shadow Knights Treasure Vault~
This small chamber seems to have been hued from the very rock of the
cliff.  Rough carved walls for several alcoves, each containing an iron
bound chest.  The only lighting apparent is from a small torch at the
rear of the chamber.  Littered about the chamber are several coins and
gems, each reflecting a shimmering display of color.  A portal of
swirling mist has been set into the northern wall, the bluish mist
roiling.

Meeting Hall~
Light from a roaring fire within a large, natural hearth lights up this
cavernous room.  A huge table, made of the same marble shot through with
swirling crimson found in the main cavern dominates the room. 
Distinctive chairs, gathered from the corners of the world, stand huddled
close around the table.  Carefully rolled scrolls and leather-bound
ledgers are kept in an oak bookcase, within easy reach of the head of the
table.  Above the bookcase, a smaller version of the great bronze banner
hangs quietly brooding.  On the western wall, under a grand archway,
towering double doors made of heavy, dark-stained wood loom ominously.

Smoke-Filled Kitchen~
Shelves and cabinets run wall-to-wall in this large kitchen.  Cauldrons
sit atop fire pits bubbling with fresh food and looking around you notice
that you could feed an army with all the food contained within here.  A
long obsidian table lies in the center of the room covered with loaves of
bread, large cuttery knives, goblets and the occasional half-eaten slab
of beef.  Streams of smoke float up towards the ceiling only to be blown
out through a small ventilation shaft in the northeast corner of the room. 
Set into the eastern wall is a heavy black adamantite door which is
covered in black scorch marks.

Grae's Office~
The cold marble floor gives way in this room to a plush, white-grey fur
carpeting, completely damping the cavernous echoes from without.  The
rich aroma of fine tobacco lingers in the air, taunting the senses, while
overhead a chandelier bathes the office in a soothing, dim candlelight. 
A small but elegant desk made of heavy, dark-stained wood is centered
against the back wall of the office, squarely facing the arched entry. 
Adorning the wall behind the desk is an enormous painting.  A single
tanned-leather chair resides behind the desk which overlooks three small
overstuffed chairs that sit in silent audience.

The painting, which covers a large portion of the wall upon which it is

brilliant colours of the painting have long since lost their luster,
leaving the figure dismal and lifeless, save for his piercing eyes. 
Barely legible on the bottom edge of the tarnished bronze frame is etched
the name: Talmon Soul.

Gateway to the Dawn~
You are standing in a red cobblestone courtyard forming a gilded pathway
to the ivy-covered, stone walls and towering spires of the stronghold.  A
white stone fountain splashes with crystal-clear water in the center of
the circle.  Dark-green moss grows in an intricate pattern along the side
of the fountain and an abundance of brightly-colored roses grow at the
base.  Lace-leafed trees gracefully lend shade in each corner of the
courtyard where ferns grow alongside comfortable wooded benches.

Bordered by flaming torches, a large golden shield bearing the clan

Grand Hall of the Seekers~
A clamorous din fills the air in this main meeting hall.  The warm glow
from the fireplace gives a homely ambience to the area.  A large
oakenwood table fills a great portion of the room, as servants constantly
place food and drink on and clear empty dishes from it.  The hall's high
cathedral ceiling and tall columns take away all depth perception and
give the room a magical aura about it.  For those not wishing to stay for
the feast, a soup cauldron heats in the fire; while a bar provides
refreshments for the weary clansmen.  In the far northwest corner of the
room, a cloakroom teller stores items acquired on grandious quests.

Standing along the eastern wall are glass cases, each containing a suit
of armor made from the hides of several different dragons.  The stones
which compose the ceiling have had a beautiful painting of dragons
dueling in mid-air painted across them.  A large, heavily-reinforced

rare shuvanawood, as is the rest of the furniture in the room.  The sound
of water bubbling draws your attention to a white marble fountain in the
left corner.  A statue of Pan stands in the center of the fountain, water
pouring out of his flute into a pool set in the floor.  The windows are
left open, allowing a pleasant breeze to enter the room, occasionally

Few personal ornaments adorn this gymnasium-like room.  The whole
atmosphere of this room is dark, forboding, and reflects the tortured
soul that resides here.  A full-length mirror stands in the corner, ready
to relect your gaze.  Shattered glass remains on the floor, unswept and
covered in blood.  A rolled up mat lies next to a wall, serving as
Trunks' simple bed.  Hanging from the ceiling are a dozen various
punching bags, and fighting dummies scattered around the room.  Some of
the dummies are intact, most are not.  The dummies that have been broken
bear many viscious bloodstains and dents to mark the brutal force that
they have withstood.  On one wall a set of sacred robes of the Paladin
class is hung here.  The robes are bloodstained, tattered, and torn.  The
once white robes, once decorated with gold embroidery are now decorated
in with dried blood.  Alone in the corner of his room is a small pillar
of pure marble.  Upon this small pillar is one small ring of pure gold,
shining brightly, the remnant of hope left in this warrior's soul.

the front of a great fortress.  The structure looks like the forward wall
of any standard keep you have ever seen around the realm.  However, there
are now other walls to this keep.  It appears as if the mountain itself
provides the other three walls of the fortress.  Set in the middle of the
stone masonry front are a set of massive double doors.

door~
The doors appear as if they would swing outward in a massive arc, one
swinging clockwise, the other counter to it.  Made of polished steel, you
can see your reflection in the doors, although some weird angle of light
makes you look a lot shorter.  In the middle of the left door is an image
of some humanoid molded into the steel.
~
E
image humanoid ~
The image is of a short humanoid, but it is hard to tell what race.  It
has the nose and ears that are prevalent in the gnomish blood lines.  The
figure has a full grown beard that only a dwarf could love.  It has the
legs of neither a squat dwarf, or a short gnome.  They seem as if they
belong to a hill-land halfling, and are set in the position of walking up
some unseen incline.  Strangest of all is the sword the figure figure
trudgingly holds up in its right hand.  The sword is obviously too large
for the small creature, yet it looks like it belongs there, because its
hands are also out of proportion compared to the rest of the body.  They
are the hands of a human sized bi-ped.  In the figures other hand it
looks as if it is using a monks staff to help with balance going up that
unseen incline.  The final feature you notice is the one imperfection in
the image, a small hole in its chest.

Entry Hall~
The entrance hall of the fortress makes it pretty apparent that this is
like no other fortress in the realm.  The walls were all built by the
mountain itself, and molded over centuries of shifting and shakes. 
Although constructed by nature, the room was obviously refined by those
less enduring.  There is neither a stray pebble on the floor, nor an
unsightly crack in any of the walls.  There is a small circular hole in
the ceiling which is emmiting a dim light.  The floor of the entrance
slopes slightly, and you can either exit the fortress upward or head
downward, deeper into the complex.

Within the hole is a masterpiece of highlander ingenuity.  The hole
extends all the way to the surface of the mountain peek above.  Every
couple of feet there is a mirror of highly polished dwarven steel set at
varying angles.  The mirrors seem to take the light from above and pass
it from one mirror to another, until it finally illuminates the room. 
Fixxed below the mirrors are some sort of lenses of varying concavity and
convexity.  During the day, the lenses are covered with blinders, but
during the night time hours the lenses are uncovered.  The lenses help
attract and focus the ambient light of the moon and the stars, thus
keeping the fortress lit day and night.  On the lowest lense you see
small script scratched in the bottom.

Common Room~
This room, directly down from the entry hall looks well used and worn. 
It is quite large, and the ceiling is perfectly smooth and parabolic in
shape.  There are giant pillows strewn all over the floor.  Along the
east wall there is a small end table surrounded by big overstuffed and
brilliantly colored chairs.  On the table is a small tray full of pipe
ash, and on the floor is a spittoon made of pure lapis.  The center of
the common room is dominated by a column of water rushing through the
ceiling and just as quickly flowing through the floor into some
underground river you hear rushing below.  In a shallow pool created by
the waterfall is a small metallic wine rack keeping slightly chilled
wines.  A spiral stair at the western edge of room leads upward into an
unseen room, and a doorway in the northern wall leads further down into
the fortress.  You can go upwards to the south and the entry hall.

Mage's Library~
This room within a dwarven seeming complex is remarkable in that there is
not a single artifact, ornamentaion, or bit of architecture that looks
even the slighest bit dwarvish.  Ancient pictures of ancient folk
decorate the walls.  Where there aren't pictures there are book shelves,
either fully wall height, or fastened to the walls half way up.  There is
not a single space on any of the shelves not taken up by a book.  Where
there isnt a full height bookshelf there are simple work benches covered
with all manner of clutter and clatter, and cupboards below the benches
overflowing with magical components and reagents.  A spiral stair case
carved in stone leads down to the common room.  A quick look at the floor
gives the most amazing sight of all.

mirror system, but eash of the portraits is lit by torchlight.  In the
center of the hall on the east wall of pure krynite.  The placard below
the bust labels it as simply, Thane.  In the center of the hall on the
west wall is a painting of the captain and his sergeants in battle.  The

Thane's Study~
Obviously this is a room where much work is done.  There are maps and
documents strewn accross a large table in the center of the room.  There
are no chairs surrounding the table, as if it is not a place to ever
relax.  On the east wall is the Thane's desk.  Covered with scrolls and
odd bits of parchment it is in utter disarry.  A spilled ink pot has
created a small puddle of sticky ink over the left corner of the desk. 
Behind the Thane's desk is a picture of the current thane, Vampy.  On the
west wall of the room is the captain's desk.  The captain's desk is
immaculate, with all his papers neatly placed in a light wooden rack.  A
golden feather sticks neatly from the desk's upright ink pot.  Behind the
captain's desk is a portrait of the current captain of the clan, Snorri. 
On the east wall are renditions of all the past thane's of the clan,
symbolizing the continuity of the clan, and how they have survived in the
past and will survive in the future, regardless of who the current thane
is.

battle.  Along one wall is huge weapons rack that is made to accomodate
all sorts of weapons from long pikes to short hand axes.  An eight tiered
shelf dominates another wall.  The shelves are made of the sturdiest oak,
and various armours and garments of protection fill them to the top. 
Along the third wall are 12 kegs labeled "Ale" and a large tub labeled
"Dried Goods".  In the middle of the room is a large chest of oak with
gold strapping.  Oddly the mirrored light system that affects the rest of
the complex is not present here.  On the east wall is a small hatch,
obviously the exit.

Secret Vault~
You have descended into a large, rectangular room, carefully constructed
from floor to ceiling of highly polished steel.  Like the rib cage of
some fell beast, steel girders line the room, arcing up the walls into
the ceiling above.  A semi-sphere of white protrudes from the ceiling's
center, bathing the room in a crisp light which reflects harshly from the
cold steel.  In stark contrast to the lush accomodations provided
throughout the rest of the lair, it becomes obvious that this room was
designed with one function in mind: security.

spacious room is a simple, but beautifully crafted spiral stair, leading
down.  A large bed, crafted of pine dominates the north wall.  A quilt of
the softest down peeks out from underneath a light blue coverlet on the
bed.  Two small tables bracket the bed, the same craftsmanship and
austerity as the rest of the room pieces.  On the left one is a small
jade box and a silver brush and comb beneath the candelabra.  The right
is topped only by the candelabra, carefully set to the center of the

Stepping off the last stair, a lush paradise awaits your pleasure.  A
natural hotspring bubbles at the top of the cliff face to the south,
spilling down into a basin of the same black granite, large enough to fit
a number of people.  Exotic plants are in pots everywhere, creating a
natural screen to the north.  The expanse of the Great Northern Sea can
be seen to the west.  The waves can be seen silently breaking on the
rocky shore far below, the music of the hotspring drowning out the roar
of the waves.

A Chaotically Decorated Room of Pretties~
A blinding array of colours dazzle your eyes from all angles.  The thick,
plushy carpet is a meticulously creamy ivory tone, a pale green throw-rug
embroidered with a deep coloured rose tossed in the centre of the room.
A profusion of multicoloured flowers lie in a tangled heap in a corner,
bathing in the sunlight from a large, airy window seat overlooking the
sea.  A windchime designed of carefully cut crystalline shapes sparkles
in the light, sending showers of rainbows cascading through the room.
Against one wall near the window is a small cubby hole of a bed, snuggled
into a nook in the corner.  Glittering trinkets are heaped in every nook,
cranny and shelf, creating a wild jumble of items only their collector
could find beautiful.  Resting in the cushioned seat of the bay window is
a small easel, complete with miniature brushes and paints, obviously
designed for little hands.  Tacked on the green-painted walls of the room
are charcoal drawings, hand-painted maps, and pictures of places across
the realm, done in a careful hand.  Beside the door is a tiny shrine set
up to honor the goddess of love, Anor.

heavily-armored knights standing before the corpses of black, red and
green adult dragons.  An enormous silk tapestry depicting a lone knight
in red armor, charging an ancient blue dragon with a glowing lance, has
been hung on the soutern wall.  To the east the hallway continues towards
the outer ring of the keep while to the north an elegant marble arch
marks the start of another hallway branch.

mounted atop black dragons and knights in red-colored armor mounted atop
bronze dragons.  In the center of the room a black obsidian staircase

Inside the Base of a Shuvana Tree~
Centuries of carefully tended growth, with the magical aid of druids and
elves, have caused a rather spacious opening to form inside this shuvana
tree.  The same bark that covers the outside of the giant tree also
covers the inside provide protection from insects and rot.  Adding to the
protection, soft rushes have been strewn across the level ground formed
by the tree to prevent moisture from causing woodrot.  Oposite an elegant
arch inscribed into the southern wall, a natural staircase grown into the
wood.  begins its spiral up into the higher recesses of the tree.

Inside a Shuvana Tree~
A widening of the winding spiral of stairs into a small room, no larger
than ten feet in any direction, provides a convenient place to rest
during the long journey through the tree.  Small alcoves in the wall
provide depressions for the balls of light continually brought down to
light the way for travellers.  On either side of the room stairs spiral
away leading further down or higher up into the tree.

Town Square~
The green leaves of carefully tended branches overhead allow the light of
the sun, moon or stars to stream through in enchanting patterns that
shift with every breeze.  The platform upon which the visions of light
fall surrounds the trunk of the shuvana tree seems to have been formed
from the natural branches.  Well-worn scuff marks show where people have
travelled along the wide branches that lead off in many directions,
though most often the tracks seem to come from, or to, a portal set into
the side of the tree.  Beyond the portal you can see a tight spiral of
stairs leading deeper into the tree.

The Conclave~
The branches of a few trees have mingled and grown together to form a
rather large natural platform.  Through means of careful tending or magic
the tops of the branches have been leveled and smoothed to form a
flooring as stable and smooth as any a stone mason could ever craft.
Smaller branches that fork away from the perimeter form natural walls
with capacious windows.  It is almost as if you are sheltering within the
hands of the noble giants of trees.  Wide openings offer egress along
branches to the east and west.

A rather comfortable nook has formed in the crux of several branches
where they meet a shuvana tree.  Someone has taken the time and care to
carefully shape branches into a half wall along the permiter and an
overhanging ceiling above.  The cozy little spot has become a favorite
among the locals, and in time turned from meeting spot into an outright
tavern.  Someone has gone to great lengths to carefully raise and lay
enough broad flat stones to for form a safe spot for a central fireplace
above which hangs a heavy iron kettle.

A small, natural clearing has formed between the massive roots of a

about the huge, tangled roots.  The rich, brown bark of the ancient tree
shows no signs of ever having been nicked or scratched as if it has been
carefully tended over its centuries of growth.  From somewhere high in the
canopy the sound of birdsong drifts down on the gentle breeze.

it identifying its true name and purpose.  Several reddish-colored glyphs
have been etched into the western wall which glow with an unnatural light. 
Above you a small oaken trapdoor covered in mithril bands and glowing
runes has been set into the ceiling.  In the center of the room lies a
black obsidian staircase which spirals down out of view and up where it
ends before the trapdoor.

Wizard's Tower - Aislinn's Alcove~
Upon entering this cozy room you feel quite welcome and relaxed. 
Floorboards made of fine vaasan oak are swept clean and polished, yet
worn just enough to make the room look inviting and lived in, but not so
much so that it detracts from the beauty of the wood, or the room.  Soft,
shaggy rugs made of various animal hides cover the floor here and there
creating a warm, homey setting that seems suitable for any occasion. 
Shelves covered by books, scrolls, and various other items line the walls. 
A small wooden desk sits in the right corner of the room and is covered
by half-written scrolls, and manuscripts.  In the middle of this room
stands a large marble fountain.  The water glistens and gurgles forth
from an intricately carved vase held by a statuette of ivory carved in
the form of a young, beautiful elven maiden.  Candles mounted in holdes
and sat in various dishes glow, creating sufficient though dim lighting
for this comfortable room.  A small bed made of shuvana wood sits towards
the back left side of the room.  The right side is dominated by a large
fireplace that seems to be the main heat source for the room.

assorted bottles and half-devoured corpses, has a fine film of greenish
ooze.  A pleasant aroma of rotten elf flesh mingles with the sweet

drips from the overhanging bridge making soft splashes as the water mixes

The Grand Staircase, Ground Floor~
This room is just a simple walkway surrounding an immense, black
wrought-iron spiral staircase that rises upwards and decends into the
depths of the tower.  The corners of the room have softly-glowing white
mage-lights for illumination, and a faint warmth seems to be eminating
from below.  The staircase is cool to the touch and so solid in its
construction that it was probably forged on the spot, although you can
see no weld marks of any kind.

The Vault~
This room is made of seamless solid black marble from floor to ceiling,
and feels quite cold.  The walls are lined with racks of varying sizes,
and hold a myriad of objects.  The ceiling has a shimmering steel pool
in the design of a clenched fist floating on it, as if gravity had
reversed and someone had poured out gallons of mercury.  The room also
appears to be quite soundproof as no outside sounds can be heard.

Arcane's Holding Cell~
This room is only about six feet tall and is very cramped, but cozy. 
Along the west wall lies a bed about five feet in length and consists of
a goose down mattress and some yeti-skin blankets, there also appears to
be some movement under the blankets.  The floor is covered with a massive
bear skin that has a brand on the back.  In the corner you see a small
icebox labeled @b@W"Arcane's food KEEP OUT!"@n Next to the bed there is
desk that is covered with little doodads and paintings of various members
of KoEF and the rest look like family portraits.  The whole east wall
appears to be a closet, inside you see all different types of old worn

The smooth black obsidian stones of the hallway here have been polished
to a magnificent shine; your reflection be clearly seen as you gaze at
the blocks.  Large colorful banners with the insignia of the Knights of
the Eternal Flame hang from the ceiling and drape down just above your
head.  Tower shields made of adamantite, dyed a crimson-red color and
each bearing the image of a silver dragon, have been hung from the
eastern and western walls.  An elegant marble arch crosses the edge of
the hallway to the south, seperating the hallways.  To the north and
south the hallway continues through the vast corridors of the keep.

A few of the tapestries depict the lord's in battle against knights clad
in charcoal black armor supported by regiments of demons.  A long banner
hangs down from the ceiling on which the image of a phoenix with its
wings spread has been embroidered with golden thread.  Carved into the
eastern wall is a small niche within which rests a small black pearl. 
The hallway continues to the south from this point, through the many
corridors of the keep.

This large stone chamber is filled completely with mounds of gold and

Lying along the southern wall of the room are several dozen half-open
large sacks within which you can see thousands of precious gems and
stones.  Along the northern wall lie several steel-banded chests engraved
with the seal of the Knights of the Eternal Flame and kept securely shut
by heavy adamantite locks.  Carved into the north, east, and south walls
are glyphs of warding which pulse with an unearthly crimson light and hum
with magic.  Lying in the southeast corner of the room, nearly obscured
by the mounds of gold coins, are several obsidian tower shields, each
engraved with a silver dragon upon their face.  The western wall of the
room ripples and wavers with magic, distorting its form.

tapestries with the image of striking golden dragon embroidered on them
with golden thread.  Hanging from the walls in golden sconces, covered in
flowing runes which pulse with a reddish aura, are several torches which
flicker with bright red flames, illuminating the hallway considerably and
causing shadows to dance across the obsidian stonework.  The hallway
advances through the keep to the south and east from here.

sets of armors are framed portraits of each member of the Knights of the
Eternal Flame.  The hallway continues to the east and west from here,

This wide hallway is completely barren of any tapestries or decorations. 
The smooth, black obsidian blocks of the walls have been polished to a
high shine in which you can see your own reflection.  A few torches,
burning with fiery red-orange flames, hang from the walls in
ruby-encrusted sconces.  The high ceileing has been dyed a blood-red
color which seems to intensify the light from the torches, causing the
hallway to become brightly lit.  To the south a large, elegant redwood
door, covered in ancient carvings depicting knights in battle, rising up
from within the wall.  To the north the hallway continues to work its way
through the vast corridors of the keep.

soaring through cloud filled skies, over mountain tops and across gentle
rolling plains.  Set into the western wall is a heavy black adamantite
door from which a strong wave of heat emanates.  To the north and south

black marble occupies the center of the room and is filled with various
parchments, beakers, and vials.  The southern wall is bare save for a
large ironwood cabinet, from which spill innumerable sheafs of paper and
bound scrolls.  A tall shelf of dark wood lines the western wall, covered
with neatly labelled specimen jars.  On the eastern wall are seemingly
unordinary mahogany shelves, containing what appear to be spellbooks and
laboratory volumes.  Despite the clutter noticeable all around the room,
the dark stone floor is bare.  Through a doorway to the north you can see
a plushly carpeted study.

This room is a gigantic round sinkhole, with walls of smoothest polished

several strategically placed orbs of light.  A spiral staircase descends
through the centre of this huge circular room, with four catwalks heading
off in each of the cardinal directions.  These catwalks meet up with
another which runs around the circumference of the sinkhole.  There is a
door at the junction of each walkway, and a symbol upon the surface of
each door.  From where you are standing, each door looks subtly different
from it's neighbours.  Looking down, you cannot tell where the sinkhole
ends.  It looks like an awfully long way.  Be careful not to lose your
footing..

Kastle's Cave~
Climbing down the stairs into the room, a sense of peace and tranquillity
envelops you.  Dominating the southern corner or the room is a large idol.
A worn meditation mat made from several woven yeti hides lays in front of
the idol.  Across the room from the idol is a bed carved into the obsidian
wall.  A marble desk and chair sits in the final corner of this room.
Lining the wall over the desk is a tome covered shelf and a small candle
holder.  The rest of the walls are covered with battle trophies.  From
the ceiling hangs a fine crystal candle chandelier supported by a rope
tied off at the stairs for easy lighting.

E
idol~
Before you stands a granite marble statue of a large dwarf meditating on
a stone platform.  The dwarf's hands rest on his knees, while his eyes
peer upwards towards the holy gods.  At the base of the idol is a pile of
incenses used to aid in focusing during meditation.
~
E
bed~
Carved into the western wall is a large square bed.  Simple dwarven
runes are enscribed into the obsidian and filled with silver to ward
the occupant from danger while sleeping.  Covering the bed are several
thick hides from mountain rams and yetis to provide warmth.  A large
goose feather pillow rests at the head of the bed.
~
E
desk~
A simple marble desk rests here.  On the desk is an assortment
of papers and scrolls reguarding quests and adventures.  In
front of the desk is a huge oval block of marble polished smooth
with a shallow impression carved into the top, serving as a
chair for the desk.
~
E
tomes~
Lining the shelf are several collections of tomes.  You can make out the
Chronicles of the Dwarven Empire, The Histories of the Holy Order of the
Monks and some private journals labled Klan Kildragyn.
~
E
trophies~
Many Trophies of war and battle like the walls.  Among the many
items you see troll bones, hides from several fearsome beasts and
tokens and awards from completed quests over the many years.
~
E
chandelier~
An intricate chandelier of fine gems and crystals hangs here from the
ceiling of the chamber.  Placed within the crystals are enchanted candles
that are smoke free.  The crystals and gems have been intricately cut
so that they magnify the candle light casting it about the room with
even clarity and brightness.
~
E
stairs~
Several thick stairs leading up have been carved into the northern corner
of the room.  The stairs have been polished to the point that they
reflect the light.
