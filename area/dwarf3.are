Vertical Passageway~
A passageway, cut through solid granite, climbs at an almost completely
vertical angle.  The bottom of the this long passage can be seen just
below.  Spikes made of cast iron have been nailed into the sides of the
granite shaft, providing slim but sturdy hand holds for climbing up or
down the vertical passage.  You cannot see the top of the passage from
here.

Vertical Passageway~
A vertical passageway continues up and down as far as you are able to see. 
Tunneled from grey granite, the passageway is little more than a mining
shaft.  Set into the shaft's rough, irregular sides are a series of cast
iron spikes.  The spikes are spaced evenly apart, like the rungs of a
ladder.

Vertical Passageway~
A rough, vertical passage stretches up and down here.  Cut from grey

little evidence of mining, ore, or gems down its length.  Cast iron
spikes, like the rungs of a ladder, have been hammered into the side of
the cavernous shaft.

Vertical Passageway~
This vertical passageway, cut through solid granite, leads up and down
quite a ways.  You are unable to see either the top or bottom of the
shaft from here.  A series of iron spikes nailed into the side of the
mining shaft provide evenly spaced hand holds to cling to.  On the west
side of the shaft, which is no more than six feet wide, there are a
series of trailing scratch marks.

Vertical Passageway~
What looks to be an old, forgotten mining shaft leads up and down at a
nearly vertical angle here.  Cast iron spikes, like the rungs of a
ladder, jut out from the side of the granite rock shaft and provide
sturdy, if rusty, hand holds to aid in the ascent or descent of this
passageway.  There is no evidence, aside from the shaft itself, that
mining ever took place within this passageway.

Vertical Passageway~
The passageway seems to come to a stopping point just above.  There are
but a few more iron spikes set into the granite walls to go before the
top can be reached, though the bottom of the old mining shaft is a very
long way down from here.  Many of the iron rungs have begun to rust and
all of them look slippery with moisture.

A Small Cavern~
A small cavern of grey-green limestone rises around you.  At its greatest
height, the cavern is no higher than twenty feet tall.  Stalactites hang
from the ceiling, with their tips barely touching some stalagmites that
rise from the floor.  A five-foot wide shaft has been cut into the center
of the cavern, through an intrusion of grey granite.  The small cavern
extends to the north as well.

A Small Cavern~
Though small, this limestone cavern looks quite capable of suiting the
travel of several people abreast.  Dripstone formations such as
stalagmites and stalactites rise from the floor and hang from the ceiling
respectively.  The limestone walls have been smoothed over time by the
passage of rivulets of water that creep down the walls.  The cavern
extends both to the north and south.
A large boulder lies against the western wall.

Formed from limestone, this cavern looks completely natural and untouched

of the cavern that leads downward in an almost complete, vertical angle. 
The sides of the shaft are smooth and slick.  The ceiling of the cavern
hangs fairly low, barely fifteen feet above the floor at its highest
point.  The cavern stretches to the north.

The Cave~
This looks like a normal cave, but there is a set of rungs leading down a
vertical tunnel, which probably leads to a mine of some sort.  To the
north you can see light shining through the cave entrance, and you feel
the cold wind blowing into the cave.

Snowy Plateau~
This area is more of a plateau than a trail.  It is bitterly cold, and
the strong wind only makes it worse.  Mountains are visible as far as the
eye can see.  Directly to the south, a broken cliff rises into the
mountains, in which you think you might spy a cave opening.

you may follow the road east or down.

The road makes its way between two immense mountains which rise thousands

mountains and simply goes north at about the same height.  There are many
booted tracks easily seen in the snow covered trail heading both north
and south.

The trail becomes quite flat and wide here and looks like someone has

trail level here.  There are marker stones on both sides of the trail
here which makes it easy to follow despite all the snow.  To the east is
the entrance to a cave.  It is quite big and you see a number of booted
tracks entering and leaving the cave, even though there is a lot of snow
and ice around.  A single great dark stone stands planted in the snow
here, a marker suggesting permanence and power to all who pass by.

Before a Sinister Cave~
You stand on a path that leads directly towards a dark and sinister cave. 
The entrance to the cave is somewhat small, requiring those larger than a
tall human to bend their heads as they enter.  Jagged stones and the
bones of small animals litter the ground outside the cave.  There seems
to be nothing alive left here, even the scrubby plants that once grew
nearby have been stripped from this area.  You can enter the cave to the
east or head west down a mountain trail.

ceiling hole stalagmite~
Because of its position and that of the stalagmite you can't see up into
the hole very well.  It is, however, a fairly large hole.  The stalagmite
is thick and has small notches hacked into its surface in such a way that
the pillar looks climbable.

All you can tell is that small stalactites hang around the mouth of the

these formations.

For some reason, the floor here is smooth, and converges seamlessly with

A Cramped Alcove~
You are in a cramped but spacious cave.  Piles of small bones litter the
floor, as do heaps of rotting rags.  The ceiling is low, making it
difficult to move around much.  In the center of the floor is a large
hole, with the tip of a large stalagmite protruding through it.
The hole appears to be the only way out.

Dark Cave~
The rounded and bumpy natural walls of this cave leave much to the
imagination.  There are many niches and hidden places that are difficult
to see into.  In the center of the floor there is a small bowl-shaped
depression filled with water.  Water trickles down the walls of the cave,
filling the bowl slowly.  To your south, the tunnel continues, dropping
down a small ledge as it heads south.  Two more tunnels lead into
darkness, one to the east and one to the north.

The cave is blocked by a massive rockfall to the north.  Heavy stones and
boulders are littered all over the cave, with shattered bases of
stalagmites and stalactites dotting the floor and ceiling.  The walls of

thick layer of dust that covers them.  You can follow the tunnel south.

In the Mountains~
You stand in a rocky, mountainous area.  To the west, a small trail makes
its way between the boulders and frozen ground.  An immense range of
mountains loom off in the distance to the north, while the rocky uplands
continue to the south and west.

In the Mountains~
The ground is rocky here, with large boulders strewn about here and
there, the remnants of glacial movements long past.  A great range of
mountains looms far in the distance to the north, while to the south and
west the ground rises steadily toward an equally great, craggy ring of
peaks.  To the southeast, you see the ground gradually fall away and,
below a cliff, you spy the treetops of a forest below you.

In the Mountains~
Several large boulders dominate the area about you, their great forms
jutting out from the rocky curves of the nearby mountains.  To the north
and west, you spy a trail pick its way through the rough terrain as the
ground rises steadily to the south.  To the north, several large
mountains tower over you.

In the Mountains~
Little grows on the cold, stoney ground here, and a few mounds of frozen
blue-white snow and ice lend color to an otherwise bleary grey landscape. 
To the south, a ring of mountains loom above you, their cragginess
mimicing that of the peaks which enclose the plateau to the north.

Cairn Mountain Road~
Large marker stones line the edge of the road here, making it easy to
follow the road despite the layer of snow which covers the ground.  The
road follows a pass between two great mountains, and you see many booted
tracks in the snow-covered ground which follow this path.

Cairn Mountain Valley~
You stand near the bottom of a great valley in the mountains.  On all

their barren rock faces whipped and worn by a constant torrent of wind. 
To the south, the highest of the mountains loom, mute, indifferent, and
ageless.

Small Mountain Path~
A small path cuts across this barren slope, weaving between oppressive,
rocky forms indifferent to your presence in this forsaken place.  The
ground leads down to the south, toward a large plateau and some sort of
road, while the path continues west, leading toward the base of a steep
slope.

Small Mountain Path - Steep Slope~
The small path winds its way between gigantic rock formations, heading
north to cut between two oddly-shaped boulders, then turning sharply
across a small rocky plain to the east.  Even to the untrained eye it is
apparent that many small feet have recently travelled this way in both
directions.

Small Mountain Path - Atop a Steep Slope~
The path winds its way across the inhospitable terrain, the wind whipping
across you and blasting your face with its frigid zephyrs.  The huge
rocky cliffs of the Cairn Mountains rise above you on all sides,
particularly to the east, where the formations reach dizzying heights,
disappearing into the clouds high above.

Small Mountain Path - Narrow Shelf~
You are on a narrow shelf in the Cairn Mountains, freezing winds whipping
against you as you cling to the rocky cliff face to the east for support. 
Off the edge of the path to the west is a great vertical drop, leading
down toward distant, forested slopes in a tumble of rocky shelves,
boulders and jagged terrain.

Small Mountain Path~
The small path winds its way between great rock walls here, passing
through a narrow gorge which shelters you from the chill winds which
batter the heights of the Cairn Mountains.  To the east, you see the
trail enter a dark cleft, while south of here the trail becomes more
exposed, crossing a narrow ledge.
