Before the Great Temple of Medienne~
Before you lies the Great Temple of Medienne.  This is a truly awesome
structure, having remained untouched by the years of constant fighting. 
Forty foot white marble pillars, flecked with silver, point the way to
the inner sanctum within.  The temple itself is the epitome of
Greco-Roman architecture down to it's sculptured bronze door and
fountain, the latter of which is shooting glittering drops of water high
into the air.

The doors to the temple are sheathed in bronze and the pictures sculpted
upon them depict a central point of peace and light, surrounded on all
sides by leering faces, shadowy darkness, and along the bottom a huge
dark figure of vague hoves, tentacles, and bat-shaped wings.

North Temple Road~
As you walk down this street you are constantly getting nudged and bumped
by the many repair men working here.  Although the town was nearly
destroyed in the last recent battle, the people seem determined to
rebuild things back to their recent grandeur.  To the north you can see
the temple, seeming untouched by damage, glistening in a few rays of
sunlight poking through the clouds above.  Two busy shops flank the
street here, an armory shop to the west, and a weapons shop to the east.

North Temple Road~
North Temple Road continues north and south here with various people
hurrying by in both directions.  None of them look at you as they pass,
keeping their eyes afixed to the ground ahead.  A jewelry shop to the
west appears open, but still undergoing repairs.  On the other side of
the road is a busy food store, with not too long of a line to get in.

Intersection of Temple and Medienne~
This is the intersection of North Temple Road and Medienne Avenue.  The
east-west running avenue was named after the town and leads past store
fronts and eventually to the residential districts.  There aren't many
hawkers here, having retreated from the cold to be indoors, and the
figures you do pass seem bundled up and wary of you, giving no greeting.

North Temple Road~
There is construction all along this street, with people removing the
rubble from the collapsed building to the east.  The building to the west
seems undamaged an bustling with business.  It seems a two-story affair
with the basement being a tavern, and the main floor the owners
dwelling.  The cracked street of Temple Road continues north and south.

North Temple Road~
This cobbled road continues north, but to the south is what looks like a
small sooty park at the central intersection of town.  To the west is a
newly finished shop.  It is currently awaiting some brave souls to open a

Cross Roads of Medienne~
This is the central square of Medienne, which seems to have once been a
kind of small park.  It caught afire in the last battle, and the trees
are now blackened skeletons and the bushes charred stumps.  A soot-stained
@efountain@n which once fed the various shrubs and flowers, serves now to
only wash around the soot.  The once great Main Street, now pretty much
rubble, crosses Temple Road here.

West Gate of Medienne~
This huge set of stonemasonry towers guard Medienne's west gate.  There
is a series of gates leading to the world beyond, but first you have to
pass through the guards that are keeping watch here.  By the side of the
gate is a large wooden @elever@n which would appear to open and close the
portcullis.

regardless of that.  Business must be very good with all the fighting and

and continues south.  To the east of you, you spot the east gate of
Medienne.

Intersection of Manor and Medienne~
This street looks untouched by the devastation, but upon closer
inspection there are still scars.  A cold wind blows from the north as
you look down the streets, Medienne Ave heading west and Manor Road north
and south.  A nice-looking house rises to the east behind a large gate.
 
A prominent-looking @b@Rsign@n is posted on the gate.

Manor Road~
You are standing on Manor Road surrounded by newly completed houses,
built primarily for defense. The citizens have learned a valuable
lesson from the ever present threat of conflict.  A cold wind gusts from

Manor Road~
The citizens are still repairing their homes here after the most recent
battle.  They have come to know that on this frontier, war and strife are
a part of life, and they persevere and try once again to rebuild their
lives.  The few that you pass, give you wide berth.

You step into this dark street and you can feel something staring at you. 
There is a desolate feeling on the street.  There is a foul smelling odor
originating from the south.  You see the ruins of once nice homes, now
housing the poor and homeless of Medienne.  Directly to the east, a huge,
apparently windowless dark grey tower looms over the eastern gate of
Medienne.

The Medienne Town Dump~
As you walk down this street, you nearly trip on the piles of junk that
has been accumulating.  It looks like the citizens have used this street
as a dump, piling all the rubble from the rebuilding.  To the south, east
and west, it seems the street has been blocked off on purpose.  You can
see a quickly erected wall in between the piles of trash.  Something evil
must lurk there.

From the architecture of the ruins, you conclude that these once were the

population.  The place seems dead, even the people walking around seem to
have no vigor.  As if that wasn't enough, they seem worried and nervous
about something, and give you a wide berth.

The road here is filled with dips and potholes.  These are the slums
plain and simple.  There is litter cluttering the street along with
rubble from the last battle.  To either side stand tents, their pieces of
cloth or animal skin is positioned to keep the occupants out of rain.  To
the south the town wall towers over the end of the street.

This is the seedier part of town.  Although this is a large street, there

is The Rusty Nail, a bar for those looking for danger.  While across the
street is a small shop that deals in strange things like reagents, parts
of creatures, rare potions, etc.  Temple Road intersects Main to the
north and continues south here.

There is a gate blocking the street to the south.  Its iron bars are
covered in magic scrawlings and runes.  Looking around, you think
sarcastically that they have done a great job.  This street is in bad

This cozy, dark, smokey tavern is devoted to the adventurer and
traveler.  Here they can order large meals to fill their stomachs, or
they can just sit back and lift tankards of rare ale, and the locals know
this as the best place to hear the latest news and tales from the lands
beyond their secluded horizon.  In the center of the room is a blazing
fire in a circular stone hearth, the heat determined to drive the cold
and damp from your bones.  
     There is a sign posted above the bar here.

Rob's Fine Confections~
A finely crafted wooden counter with a white-marble top separates you
from the back of the store.  Behind the counter, a huge copper bowl sits
next to a massive marble table.  Pink and white striped wallpaper covers
the walls above the lightly stained pine wainscotting.  The floor is
covered in a sparkling white tile.  The smell of various sweet goods
wafts through the air.

A small sign rests on the counter.

Temple of Medienne - Altar of the Gods~
You are in a great hall that has been dedicated to the gods.  There are
statues in alcoves at intervals down the great hall, and at the end, to
the north, rises a great altar of silver.  Upon entering the hall, you
can sense some divine presence here.

The altar serves more as a point of focus for the eye, than anything

$n places a large, dark, oval gem on the altar and kneels to pray. 
Looking at the gem, you feel drawn to the reddish iris in it's depths. 
Your vision blurs and then clears, and you get the impression you must
have daydreamed a bit.  You vaguely remember thunder or something, and
with a jump you realize the gem is no longer on the altar and you don't
remember anyone taking it.

char~
You begin the prayer before the altar, the eye resting on its top.
Suddenly you feel a heavy presence fill the temple around you, and you
open your eyes.  The light outside seems darker than you remember. 
Hazily you think you hear thunder somewhere, as you come to know, a
larger attention turned your way: a hostile attention.  But through this,
you finish the prayer.

like raw dragon's toenails to newt eyes.  The air is heavy with the smell

The Empty Building~
This structure is looks like a combination home and office.  There is
an old cot here and a splintered desk.  This room looks like it may be a
hideout of some sort, since the windows are covered by a cloak and the
room has no light source.

A Small Jewelry Shop~
This building looks like a shop, but without any real structure.  The
items here are odd, being things like, silver plates, jewelry, strange
tools, nice lamps and the like.  Upon closer examination many of the
items look slightly used and randomly placed.  The windows are barred and
painted black and look secure but almost as if the occupants are hiding.

used to cook the families meager supper.

Workroom~
You are in what appears to be a cramped workroom.  The place is packed
full of arcane tools, books, and other magic paraphernalia.  A large
table dominates the center of the room, and you are unable to see a clear
space upon it's surface.

You find two exits, one a copper door in the north wall, and the other is
a trapdoor in the southeast corner.

A Merchant's Residence~
This stone block house is rather cold as you enter, and you get the
impression that you should not be here. The walls are covered in mystical
writing's beyond your comprehension. There are only a few pieces of 
furniture here, but they are of the highest quality.

Outside the West Gate of Medienne~
You are standing outside the West Gate of Medienne.  This huge stone
archway leads to what looks like a trail or road winding its way toward
the Northern Sea.  Looking at the battle scarred walls makes you think of
all the sieges the city has withstood and survived.

chair near the wall here, and looking at the walls you see they are
engraved with runes of magic.  There is an iron door down the short

You are standing near the gates of what appears to be a large city.  To
the east, a trail extends away towards a large forest and rolling hills. 
From here, the horizon is truly a beautiful sight.  To the north, a small
trail makes its way along the wall of the city.  All along the road are
impenetrable bushes.

Medienne Bridge~
You are standing on a large wooden bridge.  Below you, a rushing river
flows from the north.  The view from this bridge is quite sedating. 
Rolling hills and green forests dot the landscape to the north, south and
east.  Far to the northwest, the stone walls of a large city rise to the
sky.  The west trail appears to wind its way towards the city gates.
~
what is below here?
.
An unfinished river, I believe.  It snakes its way south from thsi point.

Narrow Path~
A well worn path parallels a rushing river that flows east and west. 
Tall grass grows in thick patches on both sides of the path.  The
westward trail leads to a small bridge which provides passage over
another river.  To the east, the path climbs its way over a grassy hill. 
To the south, a small trail follows the edge of the river which flows

Narrow Path~
Tall wild grass and a few pine trees partially obstruct the north side of
the trail which leads to a narrow river that flows eastward.  Rocks and
sand cover the floor of the river, occasionally visited by a snagged
branch or a passing fish.  The river accompanies the trail to the east
and west.  A small hill gradually climbs in height to the south.
~
Walking along the river which flows from east to west, along the north
side of the trail, you attempt to peer into its blue depths.  Rocks and
sand cover the floor of the river, occasionally visited by a snagged
branch or a passing fish.  The river accompanies the trail which also
continues to the east and west.

Narrow Path~
You are walking along a path which travels east and west between grass
covered hills and a river, bordered closely by the Medienne forest to the
north.  The occasional call of wild animals rips through the air.  All in
all, the sounds of nature create a somewhat pleasant trip along the path.

Medienne forest which seems to lie just out of reach.

Small Trail - Along a Riverbank~
Walking along the river, you skirt the hills which lie to the east.  Tall
grass grows all around you and up to the edge of the river.  To the
north, you can see a bridge which crosses over the river to the west.  To
the south, the path continues along side the river.

Riverbank Trail~
Although you can't reach the river to the west through the tall grass,
you can hear it soft murmurings as it roars past, heading south.  Rolling
hills dot the landscape to the east where you can see an occasional wild
animal feeding on the tall grass.  A narrow path winds its way to the
north and east.

Small Trail~
The uneven dirt trail carves into the soil exposing the roots of trees
and grass alike.  Thick tall grass interwoven with small pine trees clog
the riverbank, leaving access to the rushing river difficult.  Grassy
hills rise to the eastern sky.  The trail continues north and east.
~
Walking along the river which flows along to the west, you feel a moment
of elation as you pick a piece of grass and begin to gnaw on it.  To the
north, you can see a slight clearing in the tall grass.  To the east, the
trail continues to skirt the hills which rise and fall like the tides of
the sea.  Birds flit overhead.

Clearing Atop a Small Hill~
Two hills merge to form a small flat clearing.  Tall grass covers most
of the two hills, though near the center of the clearing the grass
has been trampled around a hole in the ground.  The two hills climb
in elevation and merge with a larger series of hills to the east.
The slopes to the north and west decline gently into tall grass and
trees that border a narrow path.

to the south and east just northwest of the clearing.  As the path passes
to the north, a river can be seen flowing to the east.

Rolling Hills~
The gentle rolling hills allow for a good view of the surrounding area. 
A narrow path north of the hills runs from the west to the east and
eventually curves around the eastern inclines before continuing south. 
Bordering the path, tall grass and trees struggle to obscure a rushing
river.  The hills join together further south as they climb to a high
hilltop.

Hilltop~
Surrounded by convoluted hillsides below, this grassy hill is the highest
in elevation for miles.  The short grass does little to hide well
established game trails.  An occasional animal track can be spotted
on the narrow dirt trails.  To the east, a narrow trail snakes through
the valleys.  The north and west hold a set of smaller hills.  Dropping
off quickly, a steep hillside lies to the south.

More shops are visible to the west.  The road is in better condition here. 
Since there are less potholes, traveling here is much easier since one

Medienne Avenue~
To the south stands the only bank of Medienne.  Its facade is
weatherbeaten and nondescript.  Even though the exterior is old and worn,
the institution still appears operational and quite busy.  To the north
is a rundown old inn.  The door has been nailed shut, and covered with
various old boards.

Temple of Medienne - Vault of Knowledge~
A high, vaulted ceiling is held aloft by many simple large columns. 
Between the columns, the stone walls have been inset with niches that
hold hundreds of scrolls and books in various conditions.  Short shelves
run in organized rows throughout the room, interspersed with small benches
and podiums for reading purposes.  Tall candelabras spaced evenly about
the room provide ample light to see by.

E
ceiling~
The vaulted ceiling is formed as two arching coridors bisect each other.
~
E
columns~
The columns are simple in construction, owing more to function than
aesthetic value.  Each is made from large granite blocks cut into
cylinders and carefully stacked to form the sturdy columns that hold the
roof, and consequently the temple overhead, from caving in and killing
you.
~
E
niches walls~
The stone walls, carved from very plain looking granite, have had niches
hollowed out so scrolls and books can be stored in them.  The niches are
only a foot or so deep, but vary in height.  Many are only a foot or so
tall, providing shelf space for books.  Others are four or five feet tall
providing space for such oddities as a large stone tablet or a small
column of marble inscribed with runes.
~
E
stone tablet~
The large stone tablet is cracked in several places and looks to have
been carefully reconstructed.  A few small chinks are missing, but the
text on it appears wholely legible.  The tablet nearly fills the entire
four foot wide by five foot tall niche.
~
E
marble inscribed runes~
The marble column is thin, measuring only ten inches wide, and appears
to be ornamental more than functional.  Though it stands just over four
feet tall, it supports nothing above it.  The strange runes that spiral
down its otherwise smooth surface are sharp and angular with triangular
indentations at the terminating lines of every stroke.  The script isn't
in any language that you know of, though it does sort of bear a
resemblance to dwarven, if only marginally.
~
E
scrolls books~
You see crisp new scrolls and books along with older, deteriorating ones. 
Glancing through them they seem to be in no particular order than you
understand and it would take quite a while to search the entire vault for
a particular subject.  Perhaps you could just browse for something
interesting, otherwise you would have to search for an item by name.
~
E
candelabras~
Tall metal poles securely planted into the rock of the ground, each
stands just over six feet tall crowned with five candles to provide light
for the vault.  The metal is simple, wrought iron though someone must
have once thought to brighten the place by painting the iron white.  Bits
of white paint have begun to flake off in recent years revealing the
cold, dark iron beneath.
~
E
shelves~
Even the shelves are carved from blocks of granite and have niches cut
into them to store scrolls and books.  Whoever constructed this place
intended for it to last and was apparently none too worried about
aesthetics.
~
E
benches~
Simple wooden benches large enough for just a single person.  Presumably
they are intended to provide surcease from standing while one reads a
lengthy literary work.
~
E
podiums~
Almost more like a small table than a podium, these are intended as a
place to rest literary works while also providing you with a place to set
down the one you are perusing.  The various podiums stand at different
heights making it possible for any of the races to find one to work at.
~
E
journal~
After much searching, you spy what you think may be the journal you've
been told about, sitting on a high shelf.

  act_tochar( #almost, ch );
~
E
text~
The text is an archaic form and is difficult to translate but you manage
to do it with much perseverence.
  
  
@MWhen the last light of the setting sun strikes the fallen tower on the
eve' of winter's end then shall darkness rise again and foe shall fall on
friend.
  
Where darkness walks incarnate form in her footfalls blood will lie and
when she stops and speaks her mind all around shall fall and die.
  
For twenty days the dawn won't rise while darkness spreads her vile cloak
For twenty nights will cities burn in consuming fires and hazy smoke.
   
On the final day one will come, the shining knight armed with light and
if she fails the world will walk in eternal night.
@n
~
E
huh~
You peruse the stone and come to a singular conclusion.  Its much easier
to speak human than it is to read it.  Perhaps it would help if you
learned the language better first before you tried again.
~
E
almost~
Looking over it you can make out only a little of it.  It seems to be
stating something about day and night, and maybe the end of winter?  Or
perhaps it means summer.  There seems to be something about a horse with
a sword of silver or something, but you aren't positive about that either. 
Perhaps if you delved deeper into study of the language it would make
more sense to you.

glyph~
In an old tome with nearly faded ink you make out a passage that sounds
at least somewhat interesting.  "...  ancient ruins, no sign of its
creators.  We found a tablet of dark stone inscribed with glyphs.  We
have translated some of the...  very much like a tree, we know is
carathan, which has something to do with the ...  the last glyph looking
something like a crescent moon impaled on a trident, which is linked to
the word chardalai for some unknown reason.  Beyond that we ca...." The
rest is too faded to make out.
~
E
map~
In one book, containing mostly boring summaries of trade tallies and
income and expenditures for some unnamed merchant you find a picture.  It
is extremely well done, and looks to be a quite accurate view of a city
from an aerial view.  A stylized compass drawn in one corner shows that
you view it from roughly he south side.  On the top right corner of the
page you can make out an ornate mansion with large yard around it.  At
the top center you can make out something that looks like some sort of
shrine or temple, nestled at the end of a road lined with merchant carts. 
You can also make out a rather ornate fountain at the intersection of
what appears to be the town's two main roads.  At the bottom of the map,
in elegant script, is a single word: Medienne.
~
E
goblin~
After a brief search you come across a small booklet in hand scrawled
script containing the humorous yet highly effective exploits of a goblin
mage.  It seems he began writing this account when he was only a small
goblin toadie, yet managed to learn quite a few spells, including blink. 
Despite his obvious lack of good writing skills, and the excessive number
of dubious stains upon the pages, you do find several highly
sophisticated diagrams that appear to have something to do with magical
theory and application.
~
E
sorrow~
In the journal of a traveling bard you find the sorrowful tale of a man
he knew in Chiiron.  The bard accounts how a man and woman had fallen in
love, only to have their true love sundered by the dire actions of a
witch who also loved the man.  It is only a brief account and the bard
seems to have been more intersted in the fact that the man lived in or
near a settlement by the name of Chiiron and that he still seeks the help
of noble adventurers.
Scrawled in the margin, in red ink is a notation in another hand,
presumably this library's curator, stating: @RAquired copy of bard's story
in full under the title of Tad's Tales of Woe.@n 
~
E
lag~
You find a piece of paper that doesn't belong being used as a bookmark in
an ancient tome.  The writing on it seems to be hastily scrawled notes
about a castle located somewhere south of Medienne.  The notes are
somewhat illegible, but you can make out some of them: 
Formerly human...
overrun by faerie folk when human king was gone...
..........  a dryad ...
Castle Lag ..........
... out east gate, south past river, ... west ....
... into the castle itself... vast wealth and powerful items....
~
E
boring~
After what seems like hours of browsing and finding nothing of interest,
you are forced to take a break lest you lose your mind.  Perhaps if you
came back later, rested and refreshed you could browse some more and
perhaps find something interesting.
~
E
bugbear~
You find a slim book stuffed behind several others.  Though its tiny
print is illegible, you can make out several diagrams and pictures in it. 
One picture shows a three-eyed bugbear, stirring a heavy cauldron.  A
second illustration depicts a sundial composed of nine stones and a
pillar of stone, with the shadow if the pillar being cast over the
seventh stone.  Finally, in this last picture, you can see a bat's tongue
being added to a mixture of slime and spider eyes.
~
E
bugbears2~
Written on a scrap of paper stuffed as a bookmark in one of the books,
you find the following phrase: 

"When the shadow of seven of nine tells the time, pray to its contents."

tapestries~
Sewn from various types of fabrics, the tapestries hanging from the walls

still see the artistry of a type of weather on each one -  be it a
cyclone, hail storm, or a tidal wave. 
~
E
long stone table~
Cut from a single block of grey granite, the stone table looks extremely
heavy.  Engraved into its surface are a series of runes that look to be
of a protective nature.  Atop the table rests an extremely large tome. 
Two mage globes hover just above its surface, providing light.
