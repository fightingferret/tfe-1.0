0 0 19 abandoned village~
.So long dead that none but a few remember its name, a fishing village
lies abandoned far north on the Elhanni.  Its people lived on the fringe
of starvation, never having enough to eat except what they took from the
river.  Then, one day, they were gone.  Few who have investigated the
matter have returned, though it is said an old fisherman knows the tale...

0 0 8 Abilities~
.@IThere are four types of abilities: weapon, language, spell, and physical.
You may see what abilities you possess and your current skill in them by
typing @Eabil <w|l|s|p>@n, where <w|l|s|p> stand for weapon, language,
spell, and physical respectively; eg, "abil s" will list all the spells
available to whatever class you belong.  @ITo show them for another class,
the syntax is @Eabil <w|l|s|p> <class>@n; eg, "abil s cl" will list all
the spells of a cleric to anyone of any class.

@ITo practice an ability you need to find a trainer.  There are several
in most towns - just type prac when in a room with a mob to see if it is
a trainer.  Practicing uses up practice points.  You receive a certain
amount of practice points every time you level.  The amount depends on
your intelligence and wisdom.

@IAbilities have prerequistes - skills you need to know to acquire them. 
For example before you can learn second attack you must learn kick and
punch.  The number next to the prerequiste is the level at which you must
have the prerequiste before getting the next skill.  @IMin levels for
skills will be taken out once we have sufficient skills to fill out the
system.

Negative Modifers:
Any negatives you have can count for 1/2 their posative value towards the
item.  Negative values should be used with some common sense, only values
which are meaningful to the player likely to use the item should count as
negatives.  Resistences are often good to use as negative values, however
you should not get any offset value from the use of negative resistences. 
You may also reduce the item by 5 levels if it's good or evil only.

Oflags:
Oflags may be put in items to relieve the caster of the leech.  It
should be valued at half the leech of knowing the spell to 1.  If
only those who can cast it can use it.  It also must be as high a
level as the skill.

Oflags may also be used on affects that can be cast on other players.
If a spell can be cast on another player, it should add about 10
levels + the spell level.  Detection spells may also be put on items
at the same expense.

Oflags may only be placed on Neck (base, top), finger (Base), and body
(over).

tall, strong warrioress.  She wears shining armor made of polished
platinum, and wields a slim sword of the purest gold.  She is a neutral

This command allows you to replace a commonly used phrase by a shortened

Preceding an alias with an * makes the alias only take effect if it is
the first thing typed on a line.

typed at the beginning of the line.

0 0 20 align2~
.The following is a listing of the nine alignments.  Definitions and
examples are contained therein.

@bLawful Good@n - Characters of this alignment believe that when people
respect society's laws and try to help one another, society as a whole
prospers.  Player's of this alignment believe that by following the Law, 
they will do the most Good, and will follow rules and laws even if 
they may personally feel that a particular law or rule is wrong. 
(An extreme example of this conflict might be a samurai, who follows 
his Lord's command, EVEN if he thinks its wrong, then commits 
seppuku afterwards to display his personal protest.) Lawful good 
players would most likely gravitate to clans of like mind, believing 
them to be first and best (perhaps only) way to do the most good.

@bLawful Neutral@n - As long as there are laws and rules, this character 
will follow them with no hesitation.  The people that the Law has put 
in charge of the character know better than the character what is right 
or wrong. The player 'knows' this, because the Law put those people in 
charge, and the Law is always right. Therefore, such a player will 
follow all orders without question, and believe themselves to be doing 
the right thing, because following the rules will eventually make 
everything work out.

@bLawful Evil@n - This character believes in using laws and rules for his
own gain.  Even if the character is on the bottom rung of the ladder,
they will follow the rules, and learn to use the rules to benefit
themselves and 'get ahead'.  A lawful evil being would be an iron-fisted
tyrant (like Hitler), part of the tyrants regime (a Nazi) or a devious
individual who uses the rules to get what they want (perhaps a lawyer
working for the mob, or someone willfully using laws to protect their own
unethical behavior.) Lawful evil character's would join a clan whose
rigid structure could be used to benefit themselves, or whose iron
control of resources would make him or her powerful by association.

@bNeutral Good@n - This character sees the need for good.  He or she uses
laws and rules when they will do good, and ignores them when they seem to
be causing harm.  They do what they think is right at the time.  A lord
who violates orders from his king to destroy something he sees as evil
would be considered neutral good.  A player of this alignment might join
a good clan if it seems that clan might allow them to accomplish the most
good (or might _not_ join a clan for the same reason), but unlike a
lawful good character, the NG character might still go against certain
decisions of the clan (covertly or overtly), if they thought the decision
or rule was wrong.

@bTrue Neutral@n - True neutral characters dont much care for good or
evil, prefering to stay on the sidelines.  As long as the law doesnt
intrude upon their goals, they abide by it -- when it doesn't, they
ignore it.  A mercenary who fights only for the coin, caring nothing for
either side, would be truly neutral.  They might join a clan if they
stood a good chance of gain without becoming entangled in 'causes'.

@bNeutral Evil@n - The only interest of this character is getting ahead.
Whether its by means that are legal or questionable, they take advantage
of it.  They don't have the every-man-for-himself quality of a chaotic
evil, but they have been known to betray friends to the authorities for
personal gain.  They might join a clan if that would benefit them the
most, but would leave if the benefits they perceived faded or did not
develop as planned.

@bChaotic Good@n - Strongly independent, these individuals have no use
for any law or rule.  Their own moral code guides their actions and doing
good is a personal thing.  Any means justifies the end result if that
result is goodness.  A vigilante is an example of chaotic good.  Chaotic
good characters usually think that rules and laws hurt more than they
help...  they may agree with everything the laws stand for, but they
think setting down laws is the first step toward ruining the cause.  Laws
are part of the problem, not the solution, and as such, this character
would rarely join an order or organization, though they might if the the
clan represented a very loose alliance or shared philosophy.  A group of
characters who acted independantly of each other most of the time and
follow their own individual sets of morals, but who do work towards a
common goal and share information and support when possible, without a
strict set of rules might be a good example of a clan a chaotic good
player would join, as would a clan dedicated simply to 'acquiring and
protecting knowledge'.

@bChaotic Neutral@n - These people tend to follow whatever whim strikes
them at the moment.  There is no order or reason to their actions, as
laws and rules mean nothing to them -- many change their mind on a whim.
Good and evil do not affect their decisions.  If they cant decide on 
a course of action, they might flip a coin -- heads, give the child a 
toy; tails, burn the child's house down for sport. Chaotic neutrals 
almost never join a clan, as they don't commit to any cause for more 
than a few days before becoming bored.

@bChaotic Evil@n - Chaotic evil characters see nothing wrong with taking
whatever they want how ever they can.  Laws and rules are for the weak. 
The strong have the right to take what they want.  Bloodthirsty bandits
or a rampaging monster would be chaotic evil. Chaotic evils might form
temporary groups (perhaps to destroy and loot a small town), but would 
never join a long term clan.

0 0 20 Align3~
.@bGood:@n
@ICreatures of a good alignment work to maximize the good of society
as a whole, benevolently putting the interests of others above, or equal
to, their own.

@bNeutral:@n
@IThose of a neutral alignment are not overly concerned with the
interests of others, preferring to work toward their own goals.  However,
harming others in the process is not acceptable to them.

@bEvil:@n
@IConcerned solely with themselves, evil beings will do whatever is
necessary to acheive their goals, regardless of the harm done to those who
get in their way.


@IThe following categories are personal beliefs.  They reflect how you
live your life within your alignment and society.  There is no right or
wrong, only the way your character feels is the best way to acheive the
goals they desire.

@bLawful:@n
@ILawful characters follow the laws of their society and try to uphold
them.  Order and organization are his two favorite things.

@bNeutral:@n
@IA neutral person will abide by the laws of his society but he makes
no effort to uphold or encourage them.

@bChaotic:@n
@IChaotic people care nothing for the laws and happily flaunt them
every chance they get.

@bNote:@n  A lawful evil character is one who cheerfully backstabs his
fellows if this seems an advantageous action but who believes the best
method of gaining personal happiness is through being in an organization
with his fellows.  He respects the increase in plunder and pillage from

0 2 7 Alignment~
.This is a help area designed to give builders a better general
understanding of the religions and the alignments construed therein.
 
The two first tier gods, Algesa and Ulthi, are very dissimilar, which has
already been stated, but here is a simple attempt to clarify these two
religious figures.  Algesa, the goddess of order, has an alignment I call
lawful-neutral.  This means that she actively seeks order in the
universe, but cares not for the stsruggle between good and evil.  Ulthi
is without a doubt chaotic-evil, meaning he takes the side of disorder
and favors evil over good.
 
The second-tier gods, Taranth, Kerog, and Meriada have more subtle lines
of alignment.  Taranth is somewhat clear, being definately lawful,
seeking order, and good rather than evil.  Meriada's alignment is true
neutral, favoring neither good nor evil, order or disorder.  Meriada
furthermore actively seeks to maintain the balance between the forces. 
Kerog's alignment could also be construed as true neutral, but he leans
to both the sides of lawful and evil, seeking the justice that comes with
revenge, and also the atrocities of bloody war.
 
The third-tier gods, Cynnis, Kantos, and Osse, are even more obscure in
their direction.  Cynnis, goddess of nature, is for the most part
neutral, but leans ever-so-slightly toward the good, as her true
creatures are never evil at heart.  Kantos also is mainly neutral, and
yet just as the cold turning of the earth stops for no mortal, Kantos'
alignment swings slightly toward evil, and also lawful.  Osse is also a
neutral god, but just as the sea is whimsical and without order, Osse's
alignment swings slightly toward chaotic.
 
Morr and Temohpab are currently very debateable figures.  Morr, the god
of death and keeper of the dead has no emotion, no swing from neutral. 
Temohpab, whose realm is not yet known, has an order all his own, and is
also most definately in the favor of evil.

0 0 0 alignment_change~
.So, you want an alignment change.  Well..... NO!!!

All kidding aside, the truth of the matter is you probably aren't going
to get one.  I'll lay down the basics for you so you'll understand where
matters lie.

@bRule #1@n: NO ONE gets to change alignment between Good - Neutral - Evil.
This may have happened in the past, but it is unequivocally not going to
happen now.  Policy stands.
That means no good to neutral, no neutral to good.  No neutral to evil,
and no evil to neutral, and absolutely no good to evil or vice-versa.
Let me clarify good, neutral and evil.  They are the 3 base alignments.

Good = lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.
Neutral = lawful neutral, pure neutral, chaotic neutral.
Evil = lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil.

In other words... Neutral Good means you are of "good" alignment, NOT "neutral".
In any alignment where neutral is the first word, it means neutrality of
law and chaos, not neutrality of good and evil alignment.

Ok, hopefully we have that little bit of confusion straightened out.  The
last part seems to confuse so many people, and a thorough understanding
of it can save both your and our lives a great deal of mental sparring
over a pointless debate.

@bRule #2@n: You can not change from lawful to chaotic or chaotic to lawful.
Pretty straightforward I think.

@bRule #3@n: Even if you manage the nearly impossible feat of earning an
alignment change once, it will NOT happen again.  For example, if you
start as chaotic good, the best you can ever hope for is neutral good. 
In truth, you probably won't even get that.


Its not that we don't think people can change, we even used to do them
occassionally, but the problem is almost all the time it is for reasons
that are not realistic (realistic being used with some artisic license,
as it means real within the little fantasy realm we have created here). 
In the end, it wasn't worth altering 100 people because 1 person in the
group had a good reason and bothered to follow role playing restrictions
anyhow.  Most people who want one haven't bothered role playing their
alignment in the first place.  The only reason they're asking is to join
a clan or use equipment they can't currently.

So, how can you get one of these rare alterations of your personna?
My suggestions are as follows...

First, ask an imm if they'll even consider doing it.
(After all the hassle, and policy stating we wont we still have the same
100 people trying to argue to change because "they're reason should be
allowed, even though they understand why no one else's should.") 
If they say no, don't argue about it.  This is about the only time asking
another imm might work.  Asking an imm after one has told you no we won't
allow you only gets you in trouble because we post such things.  If they
said no because they are tired of the whining (and most of it is whining)
then they'll probably just say no and hope you leave them alone.  Arguing
will only make them mad and work against you.

Second, be prepared to make a commitment.
I tell them to role play their current alignment for about a month.
post notes showing that they are playing that alignment, at least 1
well-written, well-role-played note on stories a week.
Then, over the next month role play the gradual change of character and
post notes on how that's going too.  At the end, if you've impressed me
suitably that you are, in fact, role playing and have some concept about
what the alignment you are and are changing to entails, I'll probably
change you.

A little side-note about the posted notes.  A well-written note may be
short, but more often then not you aren't going to be able to write out
all you need to place (atmosphere, setting, drama, what have you) in a
single paragraph.  Such a note should be posted on stories board, as this
is the story of your character's current life.

(The only exception to these rules may be characters under level 3 who
are just learning mudding and role playing for the first time.  After
that, all rules stand.  If it really means that much to your character,
its more often a better show of devotion to just delete and start over as
a sign of your true change of heart as well as comitment to the change. 
Otherwise, it probably wasn't that important to you.  The last stands for
a level 80 as much as it does for a level 10 character.)

0 0 1 Animate Clay~
.An extremely potent spell, Animate Clay allows a cleric to call upon the
powers of his or her deity to create a spirit to assist the cleric in his
or her worldly duties.  A cleric may have but one such servant at a time,
and the casting of such a spell is a difficult and costly cast. 
Nevertheless, Clay Golems are tireless followers and fearsome opponents. 
Indeed, certain clerics have been known to use them as bodyguards and
guardians of sacred shrines or treasures.

0 0 1 Animate Dead~
.With their intimate knowledge of the spells which restore life, clerics
can call on the power of their gods to reanimate a corpse to the caster's
will.  This corpse will remain under the caster's will only so long as
the caster's power is infused into it.  It is fearless of its wounds,
though it lacks the ability to recover from them.  This is an evil spell,
favored generally by those to whom involvement with the dead is no great
moral quandry.
  
All undead created in this fashion are chaotic evil.  Infer what you will.

as the colony shows no signs of dying.

for you.  You do not need a "." at the end.

@I Your appearance should show those physical characteristics that
another person would first notice when looking at you.  It should not
show emotion or how someone might react to your appearance.  Avoid words
that would be assumed for your race already (i.e.  short, stocky dwarf or
tall, thin vyan).  Appearances should also not include actions such as
hiding (a thief skill) or things that assume how you are clothed.  @eDO
NOT PUT YOUR CLASS IN YOUR APPEARANCE!@n Your race *should* be included (
disguses do not, as such, exist right now, so appearances such as
'mysterious figure cloaked in darkest samite' are not acceptable.)
References to your race should not be capitalized.  And if you wish to
use a number in your appearance, please spell it out.

Your keywords should include every word from your appearance, including
race, separated by spaces, not commas.

Slang such as "buff, ripped, butch, cool, etc" is not acceptable and will
not be approved.

Lastly.  you need to set a description.  This is done with the command

ask politely over the OOC channel for any avatar or god to approve you.

.An avatar is a mortal with the ability to approve descriptions.  The
reason for their existence is to reduce the workload on the immortals and
to have people that newbies can turn to when confused.  Clan leaders will
not be considered for becoming avatars as selecting them could be seen as
showing bias to their clan.

8 0 0 Avatar_Guidelines~
.This is a list of a few guidelines all avatars should follow.

@I@C*@nAll names must be consistent with the midieval fantasy atmosphere
of this mud.  Do not approve any person with a name that does not fit this
requirement.  (See help names, and help names2 when in doubt.)

@I@C*@nAll appearances must contain the race of the character.  The race
should NOT be capitalized.  The character's class must NOT be in the
character's appearance.

@I@C*@nKeywords must contain all the words in a character's appearance,
except conjunctions and prepositions.  Unique keywords must be from the
character's desc, or an IC characteristic.  Anachronistic words should not
be approved.  The character's class does not need to be in the keywords.

@I@C*@nAll descriptions must be formatted using desc 1-100.  They must be
at least five lines long.  They may contain no removable items, with the
exceptions of earrings, noserings, items braided into hair, etc.

0 0 24 Backstab~
.@b@CSYNTAX@n

backstab <target>

@b@CDESCRIPTION@n

   A skill associated with thieves and thugs.  With their skills at
sneaking and hiding, they get behind a target, and useing a piercing type
weapon, stab it into very damaging parts of the body.  You don't actually
have to try and sneak and hide to use the skill, but be aware it takes
you a few moments to recover from the attack.  

Damage depends on several factors - these include: level, dex, if victim
can see you, and how noisy your armor is.  You have a very good chance to
hit a sleeping or unconcious victim, but an alert victim who can see you
is very difficult to successfully backstab.

For one of several reasons, the name you have chosen has been deemed

mythological or religious in background, nor the name of a well-known
literary character or historical figure.

.For many ages past, a nomadic tribe of human barbarians have roamed the
northern regions of the realm, hunting reindeer and other game.  They
survived many global weather catastrophes and bitter wars with dwarves
and elves.  Many ancient elves and dwarves can attest to their deft
hunting skills and fighting prowess.  Recently, a small band of dwarven
explorers have uncovered their current settlement, somewhere to the
northwest of Kha-da beyond an old mage tower.  Generally hostile to
outsiders, the barbarians should be regarded as a possible threat to
civilizations around the area, warn the explorers.

0 0 10 beard rings~
.@CDwarven beard rings and their signifigance@n
  
The diminutive race of peoples know collectively as the race of dwarves
share several common traits that mark their race as a whole.  Among these
traits are their shorter stature than that of most other races, a hearty
endurance, generally a strong work ethic, and the ever-present beard
found on both sexes.  While some races generally find facial hair to be
repugnant, the dwarves all take their beards quite seriously.  To the
dwarven peoples the loss of a beard to mishap is nearly viewed as being
more heinous to the individual than even the loss of a limb.  The dwarf
who chooses to shave off his beard risks becoming an outcast among his or
her own people who will wonder what is fundamentally wrong with the
individual.
 
Needless to say, that among such strong feelings about their beards,
beard fashion would tend to become a subject of interest.  An early
forerunner in the beard fashion parade was, and remains the twin braids. 
Among other schools of thought single braids, multiple braids, unbraided,
and countless cuts and styles are also popular.  One underlying precept
that took hold early on, and continues to be a highly esteemed practice
among the dwarven peoples is the fashion of the beard ring.  Having taken
a strong hold as a consistent fashion statement, the upper eschelon of
dwarves managed to orchestrate the whims of fashion to serve a practical
purpose.  Over centuries fashion became custom and the plain unmarked
rings have become symbols of ones status within dwarven society.
   
Though the dwarves talk little of it to outsiders, considering it
something of personal matter, outsiders have learned the following things. 
There are seven metal types used to mark the various levels of
achievement: bronze, copper, silver, gold, platinum, steel, and mithril. 
Young dwarves are not permitted to wear the rings at all until they have
proven themselves by act and deed.  Once proven experienced enough to be
a member of society, the dwarven individual is permitted to wear the
bronze rings.  As individuals earn honor and achievement they are
permitted to purchase rings that mark the gaining of prestige among their
kindred.  Most dwarves eagerly await the day when they can purchase their
first set of rings and strives to improve their standing every day of
their life.  Only a select few have ever been accorded the honor to wear
the mithril rings, and there is even a dwarven legend of one great
dwarven warrior who so embodied the dwarven ethic and achievement that he
was accorded a set of adamantite beard rings.

.@bWelcome to the Forest's Edge.@n This is a quick-start file designed to
help you get going as fast as possible.

You will start in one of two main towns.  If you are a member of the evil
races (orcs, gobins, ogres, trolls, or vyans) you will begin in the evil
town of @bVoaleth@n.  All other race types start in the good town of
@bChiiron@n.  It is probably in your best interests to stay close to town
until you get a feel for the mud.  You You may get a map of your
settlement by typing 'help Voaleth' or 'help Chiiron' respectively.  It
is a good idea to wander about town and learn your way around.  Go into
shops and type 'list' to see what each sells, 'custom' to see if the shop
offers to make any custom-made items, and 'practice' to see what skills
you may practice in a location.  It is not wise to kill shopkeepers,
start with rabbits and frogs outside of town and work your way up from
there.  There is a being in each starting town who will answer many
questions posed to it.  In Chiiron it is the weary elf, In Voaleth the
aged troll - a good way to start is by going up to it and styping @b'ask
elf advice'@n or @b'ask troll advice'@n as the case may be.  To get
@bhelp@n on a topic, type help <keyword>.  You might also want to try out
the @bindex@n, which you can begin using by simply typing @bindex@n and
following the instructions.

For starting XP in Chiiron, try killing the frogs north of town or the
rabbits outside the west and east gates near town.  If you are starting
in Voaleth seek out the tunnel worms east of town or the screech bats
north and east of town.  Remember to use the @bconsider@n command before
you attack a mob - this can tell you, very roughly, how tough a mob is to
fight.

Some mobs, such as rabbits and screech bats, may be skinned.  You may
then sell their skins to raise money.  (See help @bskin@n).

Important commands which you should learn to check frequently are
@bscore@n, @binventory@n, @bleech@n, @bidentity@n,  and@b reputation@n.

To learn how @bcustom@n items work, check out help custom.

For information on skills, type help @babilities@n.

Other useful files which you might wish to read include help @bnewbie@n
and help @bstarting@n.  If you are a member of class that casts spells,
read help @bleech@n and help @bprepare@n.

Before you reach level 5, you will need to get your character
@bapproved.@n See help @bapprovals@n and follow the directions therein
when you get the opportunity.

The global/public channels here are @bchat@n, @bgossip@n, @booc@n
(out-of-character),, and @bauction@n.  Immortals generally only listen to
gossip.  If you have a question, feel free to ask for help on chat - the
other players will be very friendly if you identify yourself as a newbie.

To learn more about mud policies, type help @bpolicies@n.

When you get a chance, type "reputation" to learn why you shouldn't
attack shopkeepers or guards - people remember you and your past deeds.

.A powerful spell said to be the creation of a group of Vyan magi who
dabbled in arts best left untouched.  This spell, however, was one of
their more successful creations and did not bring about their ultimate
(and quite painful) demise.  When cast, Blink "teleports" the caster away
from his present position to a nearby locale.  The proficiency of the
caster determines the distance of the transfer, with the most powerful of
magi able to use this spell to move several areas away from an enemy or
potential harm.

- Turn undead is a tad too strong.  Also, it's giving full exp.  20%

work if they arn't good.  Also, consider a seperate skill for evil
paladins (Anti-Paladins), similar, but can subdue the undead and search
the AP.  
- If a mob is aggr, and kills a party member, he doesn't attack anyone
else after.  I think it only check when someone enters?  Feral is an
example.  He'll assassinate a member of a group, kill him/her, but then
doesn't attack someone else, when he's aggr...  
- Turn undead cannot be targeted, it goes after the 1st mob in the room,
  it does check for the 1st undead mob.
- Greyclaw, you stated you might be able to get around to fixing the
hanging of books and signing of book at entrance to castle which starts

- the lock function for keys doesn't seem to be working properly, it

- Combat will stop if another person not in group casts web on your
target.  May restart after mob breaks out, but for something like a
rabbit, that takes a _long_ time.
- modify_mana( victim, -10 ) adds 10 to the victim each time. 
modify_mana( victim, 10 ) does nothing.
- The random trigger on objects never kicks in.
- mload() doesn't trigger a mobs reset trigger.
- A high wait like wait( 30 ); fail to ever happen.

hands in a gesture of amicability, many attacking monsters will stop
attacking.  Some monsters, though, will realize that the caster is
attempting to trick them into relaxing, and refuse to succumb to the
charm.

a weapon harnessed with care and by only the most powerful of wizards.

0 0 19 Chamber of Nordun~
.@ILong ago it is rumored that there was a kingdom in the north named
Ridania, its history a long and prosperous one.  Friends of the dwarves
that lived nearby in the mountains and powerful allies of the White Oak
Monastery, the land flourished under the strong blood of human kings. 
The ancient kings ruled for many generations until one day a powerful
sorceror named Norzan the Black arrived at the kingdom.  Disguised in the
robes of a cleric, he offered his services to the king of the day, named
Nordun.  The King refused, for he already had a cleric at his side. 
Norzan, whose plan it was to use his black arts to destroy the kingdom,
put a curse upon the King and his followers.  The King's own personal
magician, Varconel, challenged Nordun, but was feebly defeated.  However,
Varconel was able to capture that which Norzan had valued most, a
beautiful shimmering orb which greatly empowered him.  Norzan fled the
kingdom, pursued by other powerful, close kin of Nordun.  But before he
had left, he summoned ancient, dark magics and buried the land in a great
earthquake.  King Nordun himself had been changed into an evil dragon,
and many of his closest advisors were trapped within the earth with the
cursed king.  While his advisors were able to avoid the dragon, who was
buried deep in his bedchambers, they slowly died from lack of food and
water.  Some say the whistling wind on the northern mountain roads
sometimes carry the sound of their wailing voices, still buried under the
rock.

0 0 22 Chaotic Evil~
.Chaotic evil is the manifestation of pure self interest and refusal to be
subjected to the laws of society.  Few chaotic evil people survive for
long as they tend to be loners of the nastiest sort.  Unfortunately for
them, however, they suffer several disadvantages due to their beliefs. 
There are no gods which would aid a chaotic evil player as any god of
this alignment isn't someone you would call on for aid.  This removes the
option of prayer and the classes of cleric and paladin from their options. 
No civilized town would ever let a player of this alignment pass their
gates.

.Near the war-ravaged city of Medienne, deep in the heart of its darkest

while up close it is evident that a mighty thunderstorm rages atop the
dark granite walls of the citadel.  A great dark shape can sometimes be
seen in the sky, but if that is fact or rumor no one knows for certain. 
A small force of dark knights, clerics, and wizards guard the secrets of
the citadel.  Not many lost adventurers who find themselves within the
citadel return to see the light of day.  It is said that the guardians of
the citadel possess the power of its chief evil, as if it possesses each
of them.

@Gclans -f <acronym>@n  : Starts a new clan
@Gclans <name>@n        : lists charter/members of a listed clan

@Gclans -a <abbrev>@n   : changes the clan abbreviation
@Gclans expell <name>@n : expells a member from the clan

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

To start a clan you must recruit people to swear allegiance to you and
your cause.  @eYou must also be at least level 20.@n A starting fee of
20pp is required to begin a new clan.  Clans will require a charter that
states your clan's ideals or purpose, and at least ten members to be
approved and receive the benefits of a codified institution.  A clan may
choose its members according to its charter within a few simple
guidelines.

@I@b*@nClans may have good members or evil members, but not both.
Good/neutral and evil/neutral are allowed.  (In the instance of a heavily
role-played clan, this rule may be overlooked.)
@I@b*@nCertain races may not be in a clan together. (For instance,
vyans and elves would not be in the same clan.)  In the instance of a clan
that takes its members from but a single alignment, racial barriers may be
crossed.
@I@b*@nThose who have chosen to follow a chaotic evil alignment may not
join a clan.  Chaotic evil characters are motivated solely by the desire
for personal gain and pleasure.  Since the interests of others are utterly
meaningless to them, they are unlikely to be attracted to the unity of
ideals found in a clan.

Clans will have the option of remaining unknown.  If you do not wish your
clan to be seen on the public clan list, you may toggle the option
Exist.Known.  If you want your charter publicly displayed without your
members showing, you may toggle the option Members.Known.

Once your options are set and your clan charter is in place, an immortal
will look it over and set your clan as approved.

Also, the minimum level for each clan must be level 10.  You may apply
for a lower level, but it is extremely unlikely it will be approved.

0 0 21 Clans2~
.Plan A: Can be alignment based clan.  Either good or evil.  Good clans
seek to sort out the world and evil clans seek to reap as much profit as
possible.  Such a clan can accept any race.
Plan B: Cause based clan.  This takes more argument.  They can choose between good/neutral or neutral/evil but never good and evil in the same clan.

Restrictions
Good/Evil cannot be accepted in same clan.
If lawful is accepted you may not mix elves/dwarves/gnomes/lizards with
orcs/trolls/ogres/goblins 
Chaotic evil may not be in any clan.

0 0 15 Cleric~
.@IClerics are devotees to a god or religion, and their piety brings them
much reward.  Channeling the power of a deity through themselves, clerics
have the ability to perform miracles of the curative and protective type.
Other powerful spells learned by these magic users do include harmful
ones, as they can bring down a god's holy wrath upon a foe with @Eharm@n
and @Eslay@n spells.
@IWith these spells alone, a cleric is a useful addition to a group,
but with the added spells of the creation type and the special
@Eprotect life@n spell, Clerics become a unique and powerful class
required by all in any successful endeavor.
@IClerics may not use weapons which shed blood due to religious vows, but
nonetheless manage to have a wide selection of weapons and armor
available to them.

@IFor a listing of the spells and abilities available to Clerics, please
see the help file on @EAbilities@n.  Other help files that may be useful
include @Espell@n, @Emagic@n, and @Eleech@n.

.What follows are the <vnum>'s of a number of rooms, objects and mobs as
examples of how to write mud-programs.  They're all taken from what I've
done but please feel free to add any extra's - particulary as new code is
written by GC.  
    
 - Karn
  
#27002    - aedit 1, a gate opener, checks for clan.
          - aedit 2,3 entering and leaving room sends messages to
            another location.
#27003    - some simple levers and something to look at their current
            status.
#27005    - no action code, instead this was my first quest, check out
            qedit 5, and the objects in the room, use 'reset' to find
            what resets in the room. Note - that you can't see one of
            objects. (be carefull this can be a nightmare to edit)
            Oh, the quest is first given to a player by the mob
            Lampster - vnum 245
#27545    - This is one of my more complicated rooms. Basically the first
            two actions (stand inside, stand outside) set a 'condition'
            which the last program uses and the third action (leaving
            room) cleans up the status flags.
            The nasty program is the last one which basically either sends
            the player to a 'hell' if they've stuffed up the instructions
            or randomly gates in a Demon for the player -from which they
            need some reagents to complete the quest.
#218      - Complex use of reset0 and reset1.

These two categories of spells, conjuration and summoning, usually depend

Golem are such spells.  The degree to which you know the spell has a
direct determination on its rate of success.  Some reagents are more rare
than other, so pay heed and study the spell to your fullest capability
before casting one of these spells on an extremely rare reagent.

0 0 1 conjure elemental~
.Though mages deal with the intricacies of channeling the energy about
them into forces they can use, rangers are the only ones, being so close
to nature, that understand the elements enough to bring allies from the
elemental planes.  While only a seasoned ranger strong in the ways of
nature may call upon such an ally, their loyalty is oft more than a mere
animal might provide.  To conjure an elemental, a ranger must invoke the
spell over a reagent somehow linked to the elemental type they wish to
summon.
Rangers are limited by their alignment to what planes they may contact
for allies.  Rangers of neutrality may contact the elemental planes of
earth, air, fire and water while rangers of good conjure elementals from
the quasi-elemental planes.  The para-elemental planes are the only ones
open to evil rangers.

significantly from its sculpted, doll-like form.  Though incapable of

depends on the patron deity.

.This quick and simple spell is taught to all tyros pursuing the magical

developed by a mage in the northern mountains several centuries ago as a
focus exercise for his young students.  As a reward for the correct
casting of the spell, they then had a light by which to study without
wasting the time meddling with a lamp or other mundane light source.

0 0 7 Creation~
.@bThe Beginning@n

The All is everything, everlasting, and inscrutible.  It is beyond time
or limit.

From the immeasurable ether of the All devolve the Two, the principal
components of everything, Darkness and Light.  [NOTE: Darkness and Light
are not moral entities here; they are not to be confused with "Good" and
"Evil".] The Two Are.  They exist in an exactly equal proportion with one
another, each being one half of the All.  Each defines the other's limits. 
Considered alone, both Darkness and Light are lacking, each a mere
fragment of something infinte and incomprehensible.

Yet Darkness and Light are anathema to one another.  Each is a dynamic
quantity, which seeks to become what it cannot - the all, by itself,
without its sole foil and polar opposite.  This, then, is the fundamental
conflict which undergirds the universe of The Forest's Edge.

@bTime@n

The Two knew Time, or that which always was, always is, and always will
be.  Time is indifferent to all, being above struggle, and inscrutable
even to both Darkness and Light.

@bEarth@n

Sensing themselves, one another, and that they were not without limit,
Darkness and Light Named the ether which enveloped them, and called it
"Sky." Finding it without substance, each of the Two imparted some of
their own essences to a bit of it and gave it Substance.
This they termed "Earth."

.This is a file describing some of the standard problems we encounter
(Suggestion is to create a helpfile 'offenders' where a master list of
who has been warned etc.  is kept).
The criteria need to be general enough to allow for some amount of
flexibility, as these things vary on case by case basis.

* Swearing on Public Channels *
First offense a warning and a lose of 100 gossip points.
Repeated offenses - msetting of gsp_points to -100.

* Multiplaying *
First offense - warning
Repeated - Denying of all but one of the characters

Violation of 5-minute rule will be considered multiplaying, but should be
dealt with in a somewhat more lenient manner.

* Bug exploitation *
First offense - warning and possible sanction
Second offense - severe sanction, possible purge

*Pkilling before the system is in *
First offense - warning and apology to player killed 

* Accepting inappropriate help from an immortal *
First offense - warning, 1 death and removal of help

0 0 5 Critical hit~
.@ICritical hit is a monk skill which allows them to precisely aim their
blows to do great damage.  Each time a monk scores a successful hit with
a body part he has a chance to score a critical hit.  If the monk
succeeds, the damage done by the blow is significantly greater than
normal.

A critical hit only be done using an attack or weapon with which the monk
has familiarity; in other words, a monk will never critical hit with a
sword.  @INote that this skill is automatic; there is no need to type in
any command to attempt a critical hit.

0 0 1 Cure blindness~
.This minor cantrip can prove very effective and useful to the lone cleric
or the cleric who assists allies in battle, for with this simple charm
the cleric uses the power of his deities to remove all forms of
affliction to the sight which may oppress either himself or a party
member.
~

0 0 1 Cure critical~
.This penultimate healing spell channels the strength of one's gods
through the cleric and into the recipient of the spell, if the spell is
intended for another.  This is the final stage before learning the spell
of heal.
~

0 0 1 cure disease~
.By means of this spell, the caster is able to purge his or her target of
disease.  One of the most common diseases this spell counteracts is the
plague.

@R*Note*@n@G
Even after the plague has been cured, 'quitting' and
're-entering the game' is the only way for its affects to reach their
maximum potential at this time.

0 0 1 Cure light~
.Cure light is the first of all the healing spells.  It will heal minor
wounds and save dying players but in most cases will not heal massive
amounts of damage.  It is taught to young clerics and paladins so that
they may heal small wounds on themselves or on their companions. 
Learning this spell is essential, though, to learning the spells which
heal more damage.

.Attempts to remove the affects of poison from the target.

.Cure serious, as the name implies, cures serious wounds and is rumored to
be able to cure up to four times as much damage as that cured by the
preceding spell.

0 0 19 cyclops/pixies~
.The ancient battle between good and evil exists near a mystical waterfall
hidden within the Cairn Mountains.  The cyclops have their haunt within
their dark caverns, while the pixies frolic amidst an enchanted forest. 
The small strip of forest and mountainside which separate them have been
the battlegrounds for many a struggle over the ages, with the
all-powerful shaman of the cyclops leading his hordes against the magics
of the pixie high sorceress.  While the smallest pixies might fall victim
to lesser fighters and mages, only the strongest, boldest, and most
foolhardy adventurers had best venture into the den of the cyclops.

0 0 7 Cynnis~
.@ICynnis is the goddess of the woods, often appearing as a green-eyed elf
or a sleek grey wolf, although her true nature is not known.  While not
as powerful as gods such as Taranth or Kerog, Cynnis possesses a power
over nature that she shares to a certain extent with her followers.  One
such benifit is that when someone is in a forest, especially near a
shrine to her, she extends a hedge of protection over them that includes
protection from being attacked by other players.  Also, a follower of
Cynnis can easily ask the aid of an animal during battle, or even call
upon Cynnis to lend them strength in time of need.  Only those of good or
neutral alignment may follow Cynnis, as the evil-hearted are known to be
too cruel for her gentle ways.  Any class or race is permitted, and
rangers that follow Cynnis receive a special ability to heal animals. 
She blesses each of her followers as well.  However, her followers are
forbidden to wear steel, as the production of the metal often has adverse
effects on creatures of her domain.
@IThe symbol of Cynnis depicts a wolf under a blanket of snow-covered
trees, howling at a quarter moon with a naked female llewyrr stretching
to complete its diameter.

Long ago, in times so far distant that history itself holds little memory
of it, the area now known as Darken Wood was home to a small village and
a quiet people.  For as long as anyone can remember, however, the valley
south of the haunted wizard's tower near Kha-da has been the festering,
warped reflection of a healthy forest.  There are rumors the forest is
also home to great treasures, but few have survived exploration and
returned to confirm the tales.

0 0 19 Desert of the Four Sands~
.Endurus, a gnomen geomancer, recently returned from the far west.  While
looking for his father, an adventurer who disappeared over two hundred
years ago, Endurus was trapped in a landslide.  Once he freed himself, he
soon discovered a path which led through a twisting canyon into a vast
desert.  Excited that he had finally found the Desert of the Four Sands,
Endurus, like his father before him, struck out on a mission of
exploration, leaving his magical studies behind for a time.

Sadly, when Endurus returned from the desert, he returned with little
additional knowledge about his father's disappearance.  However, Endurus
did discover that what his father called the 'Desert of the Four Sands'
was truly the Naraki Desert.  Apparently a minor earthquake had sealed it
off from the rest of the main continent.

Endurus also learned why his father's journals spoke of the Naraki as
having four sands.  For indeed, within the Naraki Desert, a barren land
caught within a series of twisted canyons, Endurus found that the desert
soils were of four different colors.

Each, Endurus discovered, had its own secrets and mysteries that need be
unearthed.  But the most spectacular thing about his visit, he has been
heard to remark, was the giant stone structure situated in the middle of
the desert.  Though he could find no way into the structure, Endurus has
vowed one day to return.  Perhaps, within it, lie clues to his father's
whereabouts.

0 0 19 Desert Ogre Caves~
.Centuries ago when the land of Tarik Nor was being invaded by the demons
of the Abyss, several bands of ogres fled into underground caverns to
escape their wrath.  To the ogres surprise the demons found them;
however, before the demons had a chance to slay them, the band of desert
ogres stepped forth and offered them a deal.  It is said that in exchange
for god-like powers and their lives the desert ogres would seek out
anything that was good left in the land and slay them.  Legends tell that
the demons accepted the deal and granted the ogres incredible strength,
agility and weapons of great power to further their cause.  Recently a
band of adventurers surveying the Black Wastes came across a cave in
which they found the legendary ogres.  Very few escaped with their lives
but those who did tell of the horrors found within the caves.  They also
spoke of the riches which the ogres accumulated over the years.

@IBuried under the sand in the heart of the Naraki desert, a colony of

these busy beetles are the size of a halfling, or a gnome.  Generally
oblivious to the intrusions of adventurers, the beetles will defend their
lair if challenged... or if someone looks like they would be a tasty
dinner.

0 0 10 dwarves~
.@GAverage Statistics for Dwarves@n

Height: male and female about 3'6" - 4'6"

Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown
      and blond are rare.  Gray in old age.
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.

Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and rarely blue iris.
      White around the iris, though the iris is large.

Affiliation: Dwarves are a light race.

Appearance: Dwarves are noted primarily for two traits.
First, dwarves are shorter than humans and have broad shoulders.
Second, all dwarves have beards.  While you could possibly shave every
day, every other dwarf is encouraged to shun, taunt and torment beardless
dwarves at every given opportunity.
Dwarves tend to have hearty, strong appearances and are generally adapted
to living in the harsh conditions of the northern Cairn mountains.  They
frequently have dusky, leathery looking skin that protects them from both
chill wind, glaring sun and rugged terrain.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Dwarf@n

Dwarves come from a culture that cherishes two things above all others. 
Family and work.  Most dwarves will place family and clan above friends. 
Sure, a human makes a good aquaintence, but if it came to a choice of
friends of family, family will win hands down every time.
Since family is rarely threatened, except maybe by orc or goblin raids in
the mountains, outsiders more often see the dwarven work ethic come into
play.  A pride in work done, most often with the hands.  In many cases
this means well cared for equipment, fine smithing (one of major exports
of the main dwarven citadel, Kha-da) and a belief that a job worth doing
is worth doing right.
Most other races will see dwarves as obstinate and gruff.  These are more
realisticly just the visual appearance of their ethics.  If something
falls into a category their ethics already cover, it takes little thought
and there is almost no chance of changing a dwarf's mind once its made up
on such a basis.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Dwarves prize other dwarves above all else, making for a pretty gruff
appearance at best to outsiders they do like, let alone ones they don't.

Dwarves have an undying hatred for several races - among them goblins,
orcs, trolls and ogres.  Of these all, dwarves can not stand goblins who
are, to them, less than worthless theives who should be burried under the
next collapsed tunnel.

Vyans are perceived as a particularly sinister threat due to their
obvious intelligence and particularly vile brand of evil.

Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism, at times bordering on
contempt.  Severe differences in dwarven and elven attitude make elves
seem capricious and frivolous, something no self-respecting dwarf would
find desirable (see notes on dwarven work ethic).

Humans, on the whole, are seen as unnecessarily volatile and a race which
really hasn't finished its adolesence, grown up, or figured out what it
wants to do with itself.

Lizardmen are considered somewhat of a boggle for dwarves, sharing no
common territories of cultural ideologies that would bring them closer
together or further apart.

Gnomes are considered to be most agreeable, sensible folks closest to
dwarves in attitude and demeaner.

Halflings are considered somewhat reliable if a bit too care-free and are
viewed somewhere between gnomes and humans.  While they can be sensible
folk when it comes to settling down and tilling the earth or working, and
they don't just rush into things, they are just so darned merry all the
time even when there's no good reason to be.

16 0 19 Eerie Caverns~
.The trails around Kha-da have become much more dangerous to travel
recently.  While the dwarves have always had skirmishes with the goblins
around the area, something far more sinister seems to be hunting the high
mountain tracks.
While larger groups have been left unmolested, smaller groups have
disappeared entirely, often without a trace as if they had been snatched
from the ground.  Rumors abound about what could be happening, and even
ancient myths of a dragon that once prowled the icy peaks are being
dicussed hushedly by the concerned folk of Kha-da.
Perhaps because of this, goblin activity in the area has increased.
The goblins have taken advantage of the dwarves attention being focused
elsewhere, and have begun to multiply and grow stronger.  Some goblins
have been seen by patrols wearing dwarf armor, and once or twice have
even dared to attack the dwarves.
With the kobolds, goblins, and whatever is causing these mysterious
disappearances, Kha-da is under considerable stress.  Perhaps a brave
band of adventurers can discover and crush whoever or whatever is behind
the problems plaguing the beleagered dwarves of Kha-da.

.@GAverage Statistics for Elves@n

Height: males about 4'8"-5'8"
        females about 4'6"-5'6"

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white/blond) to a darkish brown.
      Very rarely black.  Elves have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue, though other colors such as amber, lavender
      or other light colors are not wholely uncommon.

Affiliation: Elves are a light race.

Appearance: Elves look much like humans though they generally have a
smaller, slenderer build than humans.  Elves tend to have smooth,
unblemished skin ranging in all normal human skin tones and what humans
would refer to as an ethereal beauty.  Their skin tone is almost always
touched by the healthy glow of sunlight or the silver sheen akin of
moonlight.  Their appearance often gives them an air of regal grace and
their stoic appearance gives them a haughty, uncaring appearance.
Elves age extremely slowly.  You probably won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for a few hundred more years.  Elven hair
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.
Elves have ears that are upswept and pointed.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Elf@n

Elves refer to themselves not as elves, but as llewyrr; elf being a term
humans devised.  All elves on ForestsEdge originated from the Vaasa,
whether that means they were born there, their parent were, or at the
most their grandparents were.  The elves of the Vaasa share a very strong
sense of cohesiveness, primarily due to their status as an elder race in
tune with all the forces of nature.  For this reason the elves of the
Vaasa consider any elf kindred, even if that elf was born outside the
Vaasa and knows nothing of it.
Elves tend to hold themselves aloof from all races save other elves and
occasionally ents.  Long years of dealing with dark races followed by
long years of miscommunication between humans and elves (resulting in
several wars, the most recent of which nearly destroyed Medienne and only
ended a scant few decades ago) has caused the elves as a race to become
withdrawn from other races.
Elves tend to prefer nature colors of green and brown that helps them
blend in to the surrounding forest.  Many elves born outside the Vaasa
prefer to wear other colors chosen to display their ethereal beauty to
its best advantage, another trait Vaasa born elves tend to eschew as much
as calling themselves elves.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After centuries of dealing with the hostile invasions of outsides elves
are quite withdrawn.  They view only elves and ents as trusted insiders.

Elves consider halflings a joy of the world and view them as one might a
cute child, though they offer them the respect due their age.

After losing the whole of the Medienne wood, once a part of the Vaasa, to
the humans and years of warfare humans and elves have only recently begun
to trust one another again.  Elves consider humans a goodly race, though
once betrayed are quite willing to hunt down humans on an individual
basis.

Elves treat lizardfolk, dwarves and gnomes with caution having little
understanding of what drives them nor reason to distrust them.  As they
serve the light they make good allies in a pinch and, at the least, they
are less mercurial than humans.

Elves hate all races that serve the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres, and
trolls) but they especially loathe their close kin the Vyans.  Vyans are
quite obviously related to elves though a distant schism between the two
races has caused an enmity that has become the typical embodiment of
light versus dark.

constitution).  Ents are not treants and do not have bark, sap or leaves.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ent@n

The ent is the largest of the humanoids that tends towards the side of
light and goodness and, as such, most are slow to anger realizing their
great size and strength can cause great devastation and they would not
want to cause undue harm to innocents by mistake.  Somewhere in the
time-shrouded past ents became the primary caretakers of the plants of
the ancient forests, primarily the Vaasa, and they usually live
peacefully among the elves of the wood.  Most ents are slow to speak or
act as they have long life-spans and have lived so long tending the great
and ancient plants of the Vaasa that they have become accustomed to the
slow pace of life, having time to consider without rash action.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After long association with the elves of the Vaasa, ents consider them
good friends.

Somewhere in the past ents and halfling met and each seem to share
stories about the other race and consider each other good folk.  Ents
find great amusement in watching the apparantly hasty, but good-natured
doings of halflings.

Ents deal fairly with gnomes and dwarves as they are usually known to
serve the forces of light and goodness, though ents tend to readily admit
they do not understand these ground-dwelling races.

Ents deal with humans and lizardfolk fairly as well and more frequently
than gnomes and dwarves.  Most often humans and lizardfolk are dealt with
on a case by case basis as both races seem to fall squarely in the middle
of the matter of light versus dark.

Being a race that so whole-heartedly accepted the tenets of light, ents
typically abhor any race that serves the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres,
trolls and vyans) and would be hard-pressed to come to simple terms with
one who professed to have a goodly nature.  In time, perhaps, a member of
the dark races could prove themselves to an ent, but far too frequently
such tactics have been little more than ploys to wreak more havoc upon
ents or elves.

0 0 19 Ethereal Efreets~
.A poor lost soul has stumbled across a powerful item, an artifact which
was never meant to be touched by human hands.  The power of magick of the
artifact, the ethergem, drove the man to madness, and he began using the
power of the gem to create a portal to the ethereal plane from out own
world.  Once He had found his way across the dimensional barrier, his
madness only grew worse.  Coming to another great barrier, that of the
ends of the ethereal plane itself, he summoned hordes of terrible efreets
to guard him as he worked on a way to break down the final barrier.
 
In the five hundred years since his sanity left him, he has not found a
way to cross the final threshhold into the unknown beyond.
 
Nor has he given up his mad quest.
 
In the end, should he succeed, the poor madman could possibly destroy the
material plane as we know it.
 
It is said that the gateway can be found across a hidden stream on a
hidden trail in the southeast.

familiar per level.

While generally not very strong fighters, familiars offer other

a mage may 'see' Through the eyes of his or her familiar.  [In playing
terms, you can operate the familiar, moving about and such as if you
actually were the familiar.] This can make familiars excellent scouts, or
guards for a wounded mage, and some familiars have special abilities or
resistances.  See also the @EPet@n command on naming your familiar, and
Option @EPet Assist@n for information on whether or not you wish your

.A list of players who have incurred the wrath of an imm, and why:

Phule - general miscreant and all-around goodfernothing.  should be
ignored at all costs.
 
Have banned site superior.ccs.carleton.ca -- same person (juen fie
highest ranked, at least two different accounts) was trading equipment
with himself, etc.) 

Mercury.np.ac.sg has been banned for multiple problems, including
multiplaying.  Existing players have been warned not to multiplay again
at risk of account purge.  Also included are other .sg sites and
137.132.254.51, which are the same players' alternate sites.  As of
10/21/96 I personally (Kaos) have had three of these players admit to me
that they were doubleplaying when caught.  Please keep a good eye on
these people.
    
Goldust and Kelly seem to be multying.  They have same address but
different accounts.
  
Lu bu (superior.ccs.carleton.ca): spams deaths =) His site was banned
already, so I've also banned him and froze him in jail just to be safe. 
<<Caer>> 
 
banned delmair and all his other names for being caught multi-ing
and killing mobs for his other self
 
Banned Feilong (yet another mercury.whatever.sg player) for logging on as
Sasani, dropping all of his equipment on Swiftie (a friend), then logging
on as Feilong and getting the equipment from Swiftie.  I asked him if he
realized that was against the rules and he began arguing.  He said he
know doing it from character to character was wrong but didn't understand
that THAT is what he did.  He said he's been warned by an Imm before, so
I saw no reason to refrain from banning him.
<<Caer>>
--Addendum: Lifted the ban temporarily.  If he attempts this again, I'm
all for account deletion :P 

Martcan/Gabool/Gandolf/ad nauseum -- Has been warned about 5 minute rule
re: multiplaying.  He's a known multiplayer with mucho attitudo.  Will
ban him next time he fails to observe time limits b/c I'm not sure at all
he's not dropping eq in out-of-the-way places.  <<Caer>> 
CAUGHT HIM 2/1/97 *dance* -- merior
  
Banned Dragonball/Wufan/Wukong for multiplaying.  Told him to knock it
off, and after a lot of wrangling Wufan finally logged out.  Logged on a
couple of minutes later when he thought no one was looking.  Logged out
again when I showed up.  When he came back the third time, I banned the
account.  2-14-97. <Kreel>
      
Banned Siphus moore for assigning his familiar to follow people and steal
skins from new kills.  Have had multiple problems with him/his account
since he first logged on, as GC can attest.  Friend of Siphus came on and
claimed he got no warning, etc, which is - of course - false. 
2/16/97.<<Caer>> 

Banned account of Author-Ax.  Renamed him twice in 5 minutes and returned
to waste yet more of my and Kreel's time.  Kaos 

Celar had problem with pkill, was evil and killed.  Was informed I would
be right there, when I was not quick enough, Celar promptly gossiped a
quite inappropriate statement.  I deducted half Celar's gsp_points and
warned them not to do it again.  Set Celar to alignment neutral so he'd
leave off about pkill.  Please don't switch him to anything else now 
   
Requem/Lorst is from Chebutco banned sight.  Ban was lifted so he can
make an accountm, was oked.  If he asks for password to Lorst, or wants
to the character, tell him no.  If he begins causing trouble, he was
warned..  if he gets banned, he gets no more chances.
   
Watch out for Goldust and Feilong.  Feilong asked Terek a question, then
went link dead.  He logged on a moment later, then Goldust told Terek
"This is Feilong.  Can I ask you a question?" Made *me* laugh.
  
Banned account of porno.  If that isn't reason enough, he told me to fuck
off when I asked him to change the name of his character PUNKER.  <Kreel>

Banned Karuz.  Caught him trading eq between Karuz and Adventus.  Warned
him and made him return eq.  He then gave all the Adventus eq to Randy,
who later gave it all to Karuz.

Warned Assamit in Caer's presence about auctioning eq for one of his
other chars who logged in and bid on it.  He has been warned and knows he
will be banned if it should happen again.  *Fen*

0 0 1 Find familiar~
.Find familiar is the mid-level spell which allows a mage to find just the
perfect beast to meld with.  It can be successfully cast once per the
mage's level and a mage can only have one familiar at any given time. 
The familiar must be attracted by a specific type of reagent, and vary
based upon the mage's alignment.
 
Familiars are not always as strong as many pets, but the mage has the
ability to view and act through it's eyes, making them good scouts.
can also be used to get into small areas.  Also, some familiars are
highly magical, and bestow magical abilities upon their master, when with
them.  
 
To switch into your famliar, the command is @Gswitch@n.  To return to
your body, the command is @Greturn@n.
 
Possible familiars for good-aligned mages are: ulannu jays, giant white
rabbits, white cats, fades, white riding horses, woodworm adults, war
dogs, mother eagles, white stags, and motes.  Neutral mages may bond with
moose, giant brown rabbits, tabby cats, brown bears, grey wolves, riding
horses, psuedo-dragons, giant preying mantises, adult white-tailed
eagles, and stags.  Evil-aligned mages may choose from twisted foxes,
wasps, bone bears, twisted wolves, black riding horses, screech owls,
mountain lions, giant bats, rabid dogs, or ornacs.  By the time a mage
reaches the level of being able to find their perfect familiar, they
should know these beasts well enough to know what is likely to attract
them.

0 0 1 Find Mount~
.Paladins are long accustomed to fighting with the aid of a mount.  After
many, many years of buying and training these special companions, a very
skilled paladin is able to use their bond with their god to summon just
the right mount.  Although a number of different reagents can be used to
summon their ideal mount, a wise paladin selects the correct one without
error.  From ancient lore kept by bards, the following mounts have been
known to serve paladins when called upon:

0 0 19 Fire Newts~
.Brithbarad has been abustle about rumors of an underground cavern located
somewhere north of the city.  Several orcs have come home with fiery
lacerations on their bodies, but they are silent about it and only curse
their luck at not finding the treasures believed to have been there. 
Reports of strange, red lizards have been the talk of the town as well,
and many believe these creatures responsible for an orc chieftain who was
found dead from burning scars just outside the rumoured area.

.~

0 0 1 Fire shield~
.A potent spell, recently arrived to the continent from distant lands. 
The target of this enchantment becomes engulfed in leaping flames of
burning blue and white-hot amethyst.  While he himself cannot feel the
raging heat give off by this globe of crackling flame, those which try to
do damage to his person must penetrate the flames in order to reach him.
~

.~

0 0 1 Fireball~
.A potent spell which harnesses the unpredictable energies of magical fire. 
Some flint is used as a trigger for the spell.  The spell creates a
very small sphere of oscillating yellow-white which drifts almost lazily
from the caster's fingertip.  At a completing word of power, the sphere
explodes.  Some of the more powerful magi have been known to channel
enough energy through the gate, that things are actually blown out of the
room.
~

.~

0 0 1 flame strike~
.More than just a more powerful version of fireball, this high level mage
spell unleashes elemental fire upon its target.  The mage draws in the
power of his or her surroundings and unleashes that power in the form of
a streak of white-hot flame which engulfs the victim.

.@eSYNTAX@n

flee : attempts to make you flee from current battle
flee <direction> : attempts to flee from battle in a specified direction

@eDESCRIPTION@n
This command is very useful when you find that you are in a losing battle
situation.  You lose some experience points for fleeing with amount loss
dependent on how powerful and badly hurt the foe is.  However, the amount
loss is usually minimal compared to the amount loss from death.  So
sometimes it may be better to flee to live to fight another day, rather
than be brave and die today.

NOTE: This command is not fail proof, and you may sometimes not be able
to flee due to lack of movement points, being bashed, bad luck, or
whatever.

.Long before cities were established, the races were barbaric and
scattered across the realm.  Some met and traded basic goods, but others
were not even this advanced.  Nearly all of these peoples lived in tribes
and clans.
One such clan was the Clan of the Wolf, who took shelter in caverns and
hunted for their food.  What is known about this clan of primitive humans
has only recently been discovered.  By sheer chance, the caverns they
resided in have been discovered and partly explored.  Found just north of
the present day city of Chiiron, the secrets remaining within the Wolf
Clan's caverns and tombs are currently unknown.

16 0 0 freeze_cmd~
.@CSYNTAX@n

@gfreeze@n <char>   : Disables/enables a character's ability to play.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Using the freeze command disables any input from the player's keyboard. 
This is a command used for primarily bad little mortals who go psycho,
but it can also be used when people don't stop emoting during weddings. 
Caer was very fond of this.

Use this command very sparingly.

@WAppearance:@n @YA muscular female halfling with braided snow-white hair and
          a red rose tattoo on her brow.@n

@W-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-@n

Freylia is the the patron diety of halflings and when she visits them she
appears in the form of a muscular female with braided snow-white hair.
Her domain is that of festivals and parties which halflings enjoy more than
than any other race in the realms.  Although being the goddess of festivals
Freylia is also the halfling diety of battle and courage.  Many a foe
has made the mistake of thinking Freylia is a frail being and paid the
ultimate price, for when she is angered, her wrath is devastating.
Most of the time though Freylia enjoys frolicking amidst her people and
has been known to make her presence known by throwing wild parties which
tend to last several days long.  Those who worship the goddess are known
to pay tribute in her home temple in Shadybrook by offering large quantities
of tarts and other fine pastries.  Those whom come to her for battle prayers
bring their weapons and many a halfling has said to have left with
a masterfully crafted shield bearing her mark.  Although Freylia is the patron
to halflings she welcomes all races with open arms except for those whom walk
the path of evil, who she views as nothing more than destructive peons
whom will eventually fight themselves to extinction.

@bINDENTING@n
To automatically indent code, type '<code> indent' where code is the type
of coding you are working on.  For example, 'acode indent', 'mpcode

correctly, and all {}'s are in the proper place.  Loops and if statements

@b@Wcontinue;@n
  Stops execution of code and allows parser to continue evaluating
  the command line.  Note that by default, an action over-rides the

                             -------------

This game is a role-playing adventure.  In it, you will experience many
joys, adventures, perils, and quite possibly face death.  We have worked
hard to convey to you our image of this world, and ask that in your
decision to join it you take a few things into consideration.  

First, in this world, it behooves you to chose a character style and 
follow it throughout your lifespan - people do not recognize you by name,
and must therefore become familiar with your style of speech and manner of
of actions. The setting of this game is a parallel universe to ours in a
time equivalent to our Dark Ages.

Second, we emphasize realism in this game.  This means that times are
quite tough for all players.  There are thieves and murderers, corrupt
guards and officials, and demonic cults.  By the same token, however,
there are an equal number of valiant knights and their vassals, holy
clerics, and wise mages.  Beware to treat all in such a manner that you
wish to be treated, and do not be gracious with trust - trust should be
earned, not given.  
~

.~

0 0 3 Gamedesc_2~
.Third, we have a policy which states that the immortals of this mud shall
not interfere in player disputes. Should you and a fellow player find
yourselves at odds, then find an appropriate means to deal with it. Ask
a passerby to moderate your discussion, ignore each other, have it out in
battle, start a war between your clans, etc. Perhaps you may even wish to
pray to your chosen deity for guidance.

Fourth, much adventure lies in the completion of campaigns. You will be
required to complete numerous campaigns throughout your lifespan here. It
is our policy that players not share information regarding campaigns with
other players. We actively enforce this by modifying campaigns on a per-
character basis, so that no two campaigns are ever exactly the same.

Additionally, we are working on an extensive faction system, whereby
players are brought into the game belonging to no faction, and may be
recruited into a faction once playing.  The factions will have a loosely
defined power structure which will will be as volatile as the members of
the faction.  It is not uncommon for a faction leader to be unseated by a
an underling, nor is it unheard of to find that two factions have merged
to become more powerful.  Factions are both tools of strategic importance
and means of safety for their members.  Take great care in your
decisions.

0 0 19 Glory Hole Mine~
.@I Stories are often told of a great mine that yielded vast quantities of
gems and other wealth to the gnomes.  The mine was called the Glory Hole,
and for centuries it brought great wealth to the gnomes of Orlumber.  The
gnomes delved deep into the earth in search of wealth, and it seemed to
some that the Glory Hole would never run out of riches.  A steady stream
of gems and precious metals came from the mine.
@I Some tales say that something sinister happened in the mine, that the
gnomes came upon and loosed a great evil deep within the bowels of the
earth.  Others merely say that the mine stopped producing and was
abandoned.  The truth may never be known.

.@GAverage Statistics for Gnomes@n

Height: males about 3'6" - 4'6"
        females about 3'4" - 4'4"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blond and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black.
      large pupils centered in large irises surrounded by white.

Affiliation: gnomes are a light race.

Appearance: Gnomes are shorter than humans, typically more slender than
halflings, and less broad than a dwarf.  Though gnomish skin tones run
through all normal human ranges, they tend more frequently toward duskier
hues.
Gnomes frequently have large facial features that stand out by human
standards.  Large noses or ears and, of course, their big eyes, making
them look a bit unusual by human standards.  Gnomes are typically not
what a human would term cute, though there are plenty of gnomes that do
look very much like simple, short humans.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Gnome@n

Gnomes are considered to be small, industrious workers and are known to
produce excellent spell-casters.  In temperament they are indeed
industrious as well as curious.  They tend to have an innate curiosity
about how things work and want to disassemble, study and reassemble
anything that can be taken apart, fixed or improved.  It is this
curiosity, coupled with their tendency to study the most minute details
to death, that has lead to the fame of many a gnome wizard or inventor.

Gnomes are most comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in
a small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.  In the
past, most gnomes lived around their great underground city of Orlumber
and conducted trade with humans in both Pennan and Narak and the dwarves
of Kha-da.  Since the destruction of Orlumber by vyans the gnomes have
moved to wherever the manage to feel comfortable.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Sharing a number of traits with them, gnomes tend to get along best with
dwarves and mix well in settings suited to both races, though not without the occasional misunderstanding or cross-cultural problem.

To gnomes, the elves are a complete mystery.  Elven behavior is
considered inexplicable, mystifying and frustrating to most gnomes. 
Their most redeeming quality is the fact that they typically serve the
light, and thus, oppose those races that most often like to prey on
gnomes.

Gnomes have an even less positive contact with vyans, the dark elves, who
in past times have appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the
works of the gnomes (including Orlumber).

Orcs, ogres, trolls and goblins come just behind vyans on the gnomes'
list of least favorite peoples.  Gnomes have a particular distaste for
goblins and categorically deny all claims that there is any similarity
between the two races.

Much like elves, gnomes are hard-pressed to understand the motives of
lizardfolk thus the dealings between the two races are infrequent and
cautious.

Having insinuated themselves into human culture, gnomes have managed to
come to an easy peace with most humans and deal well with them.  After
all, humans travel wide and far and often manage to bring back
information and interesting things that gnomes just love to study.

0 0 10 Goblins~
.@GAverage Statistics for Goblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      When they do have hair it is usually black or brown and is
      usually caked in muck and filth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are usually
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown, reddish brown, or a muddy-amber color.  The iris 
      extends to the edge of the eye with a pupil that dilates between
      a pinprick in size to large circle as lighting permits.

Affiliation: goblins are a dark race.

Appearance: goblins have wrinkled, carggy skin or smooth, greasy skin in
colors of greens and browns or patchy/mottled earth tone mixes.  Though
they have fewer warts and protuberances than orcs, ogres and trolls, they
are not completely free of them as a race.  Goblins tend to have sharp
teeth, though they are small and would not be called fangs by any
stretch of the imagination.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Goblin@n

Goblins are a tough and wily breed known for their extreme tolerance of
situations that would drive out most other races.  Their resistance to
disease and infection as well as their tendency to reproduce in great
numbers make them about as impossible to be rid of as cockroaches.  Most
often the truth of the matter is that the larger races goblins hang
around are better at digging out tunnels and caves and cast off more than
ample resources to provide goblins with all they need to survive. 
Unfortunately for the larger races this means that the goblins also have
free time to explore and be a general nuisance.

Goblins really could care less about wasting time on hygiene and actually
enjoy the feel of cool, slimy muck squishing between toes, fingers and
any other joint.  Their greatest joys in life are exploring everywhere,
everything, and gathering as many things as they can.  To most other
races this comes across as intrusion and theft, however, the goblins seem
to be one of the few peoples who truly understand and are happy with the
rule stating that possession is 9/10ths of the law.
Though goblins have pervaded everywhere there are generally only two
varieties to be found.  The more common is the typical small, smelly
green goblin.  The rarer white goblin is found only in the northern Cairn
mountains and have a tendency to be a bit larger and more organized than
their smaller cousins.  Though more organized, the white goblins seem to
be more like small orcs and tend to make poor spell casters.  Of the two
varieties, green goblins tend to make the better thieves and explorers
while white goblins tend to make better warriors and know how to dig in
and occupy an area.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Goblins are a very communal people and love to chatter away at each
other, though much of the conversation usually consists of "mine, mine,
mine!" 

Trolls and ogres are considered dangerous and insufferable because they
tend to use their superior size and strength to boss around the goblins. 
The only thing that makes being near them tolerable is the sheer amount
of useful goods they leave just lying around or cast off.

Orcs as bad as ogres and trolls, only what they lack in comparative
strength they make up for in organization and intellect.  Fortunately any
goblin can point out just why goblins are still the superior intelligence
of the four races.

Goblins will avoid dwarves when possible due to a long-standing dwarven
crusade to destroy all goblins.  Unfortunately they are all too good at
that task as goblins have learned.  Dwarves are the goblins most hated of
all races and any jab they can inflict on the race is worth getting in.

Elves are almost as bad as dwarves, though if it has been amply
demonstrated that if you leave them alone they will usually leave you
alone.

Vyans are an odd lot and, for those interested in attempting to wheedle
it out of them, are an excellent source one can learn magic from. 
Everything an elf could be is brought forth in what the vyans are. 
Unfortunately it also comes at the price of more insufferably bullying,
and with their swords and magic the vyans are quick to back up any
threats.  Still, they make excellent allies.

Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to goblins who figure that somehow the
races must be related, with gnomes the lesser relation in need of goblin
help, of course.  Why gnomes can't seem to learn to take orders and
continue to associate with races like dwarves is a source of constant
frustration to the goblins who would desperately like a new ally (or,
better yet, someone they could actually bully around).

Humans are a source of never-ending amazement, so long as you don't hang
out with the goody-goody ones that just want to kill you.  They build
dwellings almost everywhere, travel more than any other race and return
with so many neat things for goblins to appropriate.  Not to mention they
make the most amusing faces when they are forced to deal with goblins.

Halflings, as far as goblins are concerned, are just another race of
humans only shorter and more likely to be easier to boss around. 
Unfortunately they aren't quite as productive when it comes to
travelling and acquiring new things for goblins to appropriate.

Ents are a bit of a mystery.  They may look a bit like trolls but they
are neither as blatantly hostile nor as pleasing to the eye.  No slime,
no warts, and their skin almost looks more like bark than the nice
texture common to trolls.  Fortunately they do have the most interesting
responses when you uproot small plants or set larger ones on fire.

0 0 1 greater animation~
.Calling upon the casters greater understanding of life and death and the
means by which corpses can be reanimated, this spell can be used to
reanimate a corpse with even greater power.  The corpses flesh will rot
away leaving behind a grisly skeleton that will be harder to hit and more
dangerous than its zombie counterpart.  Like its lesser zombie form, it
is slave to the caster's will, remains under the casters control only so
long as his or her power infuses it, and it is unable to heal from its
wounds.  This is an evil spell, favored generally by those to whom
involvement with the dead is no great moral quandary.
  
All undead created in this fashion are chaotic evil.  Infer what you will.

.Gossip points are a method to limit the amount a player uses the global
channels.  The desire for this is due to some players having a tendency
to be rather loquacious if not somehow muffled.  A player begins the game
with a small amount which slowly increases to a maximum of 1000 with time.
Using chat or OOC costs 1 gossip point, gossip requires 10 and shout
requires 500.  Minor swearing invokes a penalty of 50 gossip points.  The

This skill lets those with advanced fighting skills prevent damage from

16 0 4 Guidelines~
.A list of basic guidelines and proper form for building:

@bRoom Names@n - Are similar to titles and should be capitalized as such.

@bRbugs@n - Use these.  If you no_mob a room, make it safe, or set an
unusual rflag, add a permanent rbug.  It saves time later in case of
problems.

@bMob treasure/items@n - Mobs should have logical eq and treasure.  A
rabid dog, or a shambling mound should not reset with coins, for example. 
Think of what a mob would logically use, and not just what would be a
'neat' item, when doing resets.  Helps the realism angle.

@bArea Layout@n - Long and unrealistic strings of rooms are *bad*. 
Ideally, players ought to be able to move in all directions at all times. 
If you don't want to build something to the north, come up with a
legitimate (or semi-legitimate, at least) reason why they cannot move in
a direction - a rushing river, a steep cliff, a thick wall of brambles,
*something*.  In any case, avoid long awkward paths - these will become
deathtraps once pkill is in.

@bAnachronisms@n - Anything which undermines the illusion of this world
should be avoided.  Cutsey jokes may be funny the first time, but after a
while they lose their humor and just detract from the roleplaying
environment.  Jokes that are in-character are better than good, but
comments about real life are out of place and time and therefore
inappropriate.

@bItem Resets@n - Do not reset items of any significant value on the 
floor of rooms.  Even if guarded, eventually someone will be able to kill
the mob, quit, wait for repop, and repeat the process over and over to
get multiples of the item.

@bOriginality@n - No ripping off others' ideas.  Period.  We want all
original ideas, and while we're operating within a genre which owes a lot
to certain sources, let's not parrot back what's already been done.  Be
inspired by something, but take it somewhere new.  'Nuff said.

@bShopkeepers@n - These should be HIGH level, and have a summon function
with at least a 50% chance of summon each turn.  They should be able to
see invisible, detect hidden, and be resistant to poison and sleep in
order to foil players' constant attempts at larceny.  Armor shops should
not reset  above studded leather, with the exception of banded armor
in Kha-Da, and weapons shops' stocks should be comprised of bronze
weapons, with a few bits of iron and NO steel or + weapons.  This is an
adventure game, not an excursion to the mall.  Good items should be rare
and found in out-of-the way places, thereby giving incentive for players
to explore and take risks to get them.

@bProprietary Items@n - Certain items can only be found in certain places
in certain areas, and players have to go on a mini-search for them.  Be
careful not to reset such items elsewhere.  Before you reset an item,
make sure you know where else it is found, and whether your reset would
undercut a previously designed area.  When in doubt, post on the imm
board.

@bRepair levels@n - set these on items.  Make them > 3 unless you want
players repairing the item once the repair skill is implemented.

.The Forest's Edge has no guilds per se.  Instead any mob can be a teacher
of any skill.  Most skills are taught by shopkeepers and a few dedicated
trainers.  To see if any mob in the room can teach any skills to you type
@hprac@n.  If there is a trainer in the room you will be told there is
nothing they can teach you or will be given a list of what they can teach
you and how much everything costs.

Affiliation: Halflings are a light race.

Appearance: Halflings look quite like human children until they reach

attributes, only they retain their shorter stature.  Halflings most often
develop a stout build, some say due to the minimum of 5 meals a day they
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend.  For
those with prior role playing experience; halflings are not hobbits.  We
aren't going to ban you for having hairy feet, but realize, it is not the
norm.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Halfling@n

Halflings are typically good natured, care-free folk who are more
interested in settling down and enjoying life rather than adventuring. 
Since the idea of the game is to adventure, this means you are most
probably playing a halfling that is not quite that normal.  A normal
"adventuring" halfling is one who still values the good things in life:
good meals, good company, and cheerful surroundings.  Halflings are so
steeped in the realm of light and goodness (they can be no alignment but
good) that they tend to brighten any place they can go with a desire to
bring simple goodness with them.
The ideal adventure for your typical non-adventuring halfling would be
settingling down with friends in a nice tavern to tell tales and discuss
adventures while sharing food and drink.  Your average adventuring
halfling, while finding the same pursuit equally exciting, tends to want
to go see these places for themselves as well as talk about them.

@yRacial Relations:@n
Halflings, though typically shy around non-halflings, are found quite
frequently among dwarven and human settlements having insinuated
themselves quite merrily into both cultures.

Halflings tend to view elves with some awe, seeing in them their goodness
and ethereal beauty.  The fact that elves treat halflings as cheerful
little icons of goodness doesn't hurt either.

Gnomes are viewed as distant cousins as many of the same living
environments have been shared over time and few quarrels have resulted
over it.

Halflings detest goblins and orcs, the former race being nothing more
than a disruptive nuisance and the latter treating them no better than
they tend to treat goblin slaves.  Confrontations between these races
tends to be short and bloody.

Ogres tend to avoid halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large,
slow ogres.

Halflings tend to avoid trolls, as they look like a nice feast to most
trolls.

Lizardfolk are viewed with as a curiosity, halflings having rare contact
with them and no basis for understanding the culture at all.

0 0 19 Hill Giants Cave~
.@C@bDESCRIPTION@n
@IThe folks of Kha-da and its out lying settlements have lately been
troubled by marauding giants.  Huge, brown-haired hill giants, dressed
only in loincloths, ambush caravans, plunder small villages and generally
destroy things.  The dwarves are massing to destroy them, though, so far,
their efforts have had minimal affect;  the giants simply retreat to their
lair and close the massive boulder behind them.  Many treasure-hunting
thieves have ventured into the lair after the spoils of the raiding
giants, though none has ever returned to tell the tale.

0 0 19 Hills of Pennan~
.Around the Greened Way west of Pennan lies many hills that overlook the
verdant valley of Pennan.  Rich with wildlife, this area also provides
fertile ground for domesticated animals to feed upon.  The region is also
famous for legendary monsters as well as wandering thieves and cutthroats.

Hobgoblin Outpost (Level 15):

Somewhere off the end of the Greened Way lies a once abandoned guard
outpost, now taken over by a fiercely xenophobic tribe of hobgoblins. 
Larger than their cousins, the goblins, these creatures are about similar
in height to humans but are considerably heavier.  Not known to raid
towns, the hobgoblins are, however, famous for their cruelty and torture
of those unfortunate enough to stumble into their lair.  Those who
consider venturing into the outpost are advised to proceed with caution
as the hobgoblins boast very capable warriors, as well as magical aid
from their incantrix.

The Silent Pines (Level 15):

South of the Greened Way lies a thick cluster of pine trees.  Tales of
great danger and mystery surround this area, which some say is draped
with gauze-like webs.  Those who have explored this region swear that the
pines themselves are sentient and resentful towards intruders.

The Chamber of the Aspects (Level 40):

Deep within the northern parts of the Pennan hills lies a place of great
mystery and secrets.  Tales from adventurous wanderers claim that great
powers roam beyond a dark and sinister cavern.  They also claim that some
devout followers of a strange religion reside within, fiercely guarding
those powers.

and danger all wrapped in the cocoon of a more-or-less medieval setting.


@GOptional Advice for Role Playing a Human@n

This is basically the essence of role playing in a nutshell.  You created
your character, gave them form with statistics (the numbers that define
your strength and wisdom, dexterity and heartiness), and determined what
your occupation in this life will be.  Now it is time to breathe life
into this character.  Not just by stepping forth and killing anything
that gets in your way (though if you choose to do this is certainly
your choice), but by figuring out what this persona you've created is
like.
Are they exactly like you?  Or are they braver or more timid than you? 
What is their favorite food?  What do they like to do when they aren't
saving the world from the invading forces of darkness (or wreaking havoc
upon the weak-minded fools if you are evil).  Think of all these things
and what your character would be like if you met them.  Now try and
portray these things by your actions and words.
Want to impress someone with your role playing savvy?  Don't just walk up
and say "lets go kill some ants", unless of course you already know them
and are in a hurry, rather consider what you might really do.  If you ran
into a total stranger in the real world dressed as a priest, would you
greet him/her the same way you would greet a total stranger wearing a
full military outfit?  Would you just walk up to a complete stranger in a
nun's habit and say "Hey, want to go shoot some hoops at the local gym"? 
(If you answered yes to either of these, you might wish to seek
counseling).  In most cases the answer should be no.  Neither would most
characters do that.  How would you're character handle the situation? 
That's the basic essence of role playing.
Create not just a character, but a personality to go with it.  Then take
that personality and play it.  Do it consistently and you'll find
situations begin to arise that you have to muddle through and you'll see
your character evolving.
Now, if you're just looking for a good hack-and-slash environment we can
offer that too.  Just head right out and find the nearest things to kill. 
I'd advise using the consider command frequently in either case.  Its
also a pretty bad idea to start killing townsfolk as the guards in town
are a bit touchy about that sort of thing.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Humans have perhaps the greatest chance to meet and greet all the races
as a race for they, among all the races present on TFE have the greatest
variance of alignment and tendency to be good or evil.

Humans get along best with halflings and gnomes having shared close
living space with them for some time.

Humans get along fairly well with dwarves and lizardfolk, though do not
profess to understand them overly well as both other races are relatively
secluded from the human perspective.

Humans and elves only recently developed a stable relationship, having
been at war off and on in the past.  Many humans still distrust the elves
owing to so many years of ambushes, raids, and general mistrust that
developed throughout a war that very nearly destroyed the largest human
settlement, Medienne.  Throughout all this there have always been other
humans willing to trust the elves for their ethereal beauty and grace
that seems to set them above humans, even as others found these traits
alien and frightening.

Ents are considered a curiosity, sought by many as few are rarely seen. 
Soon after humans tend to lose interest in ents finding their slow,
deliberate ways too drawn out for their tastes.

Humans have peculiar dealings with orcs, with most contact between the
races occurring through dealing of a very mercenary nature.  Orcs aren't
the most cohesive of races and humans have had to deal with dozens of
various orc tribes whose only constant factor has been a tendency towards
brutish strength and barbaric vulgarity from a human perspective. 
Despite these social faux pas, orcs have been considered both allies and
enemies from time to time.

Likewise, humans have had similar dealings with ogres.  While ogres are
typically considered more dangerous and more predictable only because you
can only count on two things (that an ogre will be bigger than you are
and more disagreeable) humans have, on occasion, hired ogres as guards or
workers when their appetites for violence and food can be sated.

Humans tend to avoid trolls and goblins, finding the former race too
ready to eat humans regardless of how you handle them and the latter
race too capricious and filthy to be trusted.  In either case the races
are best avoided or pushed elsewhere to let others deal with them.

Vyans, primarily because they look so much like elves, are treated with
the same cautiousness if at all.  Typically only humans steeped in the
darker aspects of evil culture have any dealing at all with vyans.  Those
humans that lean towards the light not only distrust the vyans for their
elf-like appearance, but more so for the utter acts of evil purported to
be their doings.

0 0 0 Imm Policies~
.@bCommon Sense@n
If you are reading this, you should know intuitively what you should and
should not do.  No dispensing of untoward favors, giving out items,
information, using your immortal status to help others, etc.  If you have
a question about whether you may or may not do something *ask beforehand*.

@bPlayer Assistance@n 
Player assistance is only to be give by Imms level 94 and over.  Imms
below 94 should keep player interaction at a minimum, and try to remain
invis to players.  Apprentices (level 92) should always remain invisible,
and should have no interaction save in emergency situations.  Those
qualified to do approvals may do so should no avatars be present.

Player assistance is only allowed for players at or lower than level 2. 
The types of assistance you may give are giving food or drink when they
are starving or thirsty, removing the plague, sending them to a safe town
if they have locked themselves in a very aggressive area, etc.  You may
NOT load equipment for the player or give him items other than the basic
necessities for his problem.

@bPlayer Reimbursement@n
Player reimbursement can only be given by Imms level 93 or higher.  No
reimbursments may be given to players whom an imm knows in real life. 
Player reimbursements are only given if they lost their equipment
directly due to a MUD bug.  They will only be reimbursed for equipment in
their backup files.  Backups are made every couple days, so they could
have lost equipment that they gained in the last day or two.  At the same
time, they might gain equipment that broke in battle, etc.  We do not
reimburse due to crashes or lag.  Equipment on corpses 'created'
immediately before crashes will reappear on the body when the mud returns.

@bPlayer Renaming@n
All imms and avatars may politely ask players to change their names.  If
a player insists on keeping it, only a level 93 or higher may force him
to change it.

Players are asked to pick names that fit both their character and the
medieval time period.  If the player's name does not meet these
requirements, we will politely ask them to pick a more fitting name.
If a player is below level 3, only insist that they change the name if it
is extremely offensive or inappropriate.  i.e.  Dickhead or Mickey Mouse 
Otherwise, let the player experience the mud for a couple of levels.  If
he stays to level 3, then politely ask him to change his name.

The same type of interaction applies to interactions regarding player
approvals.  Players who are not responsive to avatar requests should be
referred to a high level immortal.
@bPenalties@n
Penalties for violation of policies are as follows: 

1st time:  warning, level loss, possible purge
2nd time:  automatic level loss, possible purge
3rd time:  automatic purge

Punishment is at the discretion of the senior Imms.

@bImmortal Identities@n
If you play a mortal, keep things separate.  Do @bNOT@n give out your
identity, and let players find out that character X is played by an
immortal.  Fairness is critical for the mud, and any appearance of
favoritism or impropriety is damaging.  Extremely so.  This cannot be
emphasized too much.  (Also remember that you are an imm first now and a
player second.) 

@bArea Design@n
Before an area can be created, it must be approved by Merior.  Please
send her a description of the area, why it exists, what types of mobs
will be there, etc.  If it doesn't have a rationale don't waste your time building.  Themes are important.

@bArea Opening@n
Before an area can be opened it must be checked by at least one other .
Send a request for review to Merior and Starshine.  It may not be opened
until both have given you permission.

@bPlayer Interaction@n
As previously stated, apprentices (level 92's) do not exist as far as
players are concerned.  All other imms may be visible at their own
discretion.  They are expected to be courteous to all mortals, but should
provide no assistance other then that described above.  Immortals should
not load ANY items for mortals, no matter how innocuous, except during bug
reimbursements as described above.  Immortals obviously should not join
clans or participate in other mortal activities.  Participation in OOC
activities should be limited to keep immortals from seeming too mortal. 
This type of interaction, of course, may be done by mortal alternates.

@bImmortal Knowledge@n
Immortals are expected not to use their powers to gain knowledge
useful in day-to-day playing.  Area authors are expected not to take
leadership roles in groups in their own areas, so as not to reveal any
secrets.  Those immortals who, through the course of routine work, become
privy to information not available to players, are required to keep this
to themselves.  Those abusing their powers will be dealt with by Greyclaw
and/or Merior.

.HOW TO MAKE GOOD QUESTS


A.) A Bill of Player's Rights
Perhaps the most important point about designing quests is to think as a
player and not as a designer, the least a playerdeserves is: 

a1) Not to be killed without warning
a2)Not to be given horribly unclear hints.
a3) To be able to win without the experience of past lives
a4) To be able to win without knowledge of future events
a5) Not to have the game closed off without warning, i.e.  no one way
dead ends 
a6) Not to need to do unlikely things
a7) Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it , i.e.  lets make
sense 
a8) Not to have to type exactly the right verb
a9) To be allowed reasonable synonyms
a10) To have reasonable freedom of action
a11) Not to have to depend on luck
a12) To be able to understand a problem once it is solved
a13) Not to be given too many red herrings 
a14) To have a good reason why something is impossible
a15)  Not to need to be American to understand hints
a16) To know how the game is getting on

0 0 9 information~
.Many things require that you obtain knowledge from different parts of
the game.  This can be done through a variety of ways.

Using the 'to' command and asking NPCS about different things is a great
way to learn.  Usually, starting such conversations with 'hi' OR asking
them about something they might know about is the first place you can
start.  Often NPCS will make it obvious about what they want to talk
about.

Taverns, Inns, and Bars are also a good source of information.  Everyday
travelers resting in these types of places often have a lot to say - if
you just listen in.  Traveling minstrels and bards sometimes frequent
these places.

In addition to the above, there are several depositories of knowledge
scattered about the world, from musty old libraries to abandoned mage
towers filled with old scrolls.

0 0 1 Infravision~
.The target of this spell has his or her eyes magically enhanced to see
not only the color spectrum, but also the infrared spectrum.  This
pertains to the visible waves given off from heat.  Most of the time, you
can make out a room, from the warmth of it's walls and furniture as
opposed to it's air.  But there is a limit, and many things will
obviously not give off any irregular heat.

0 0 0 Ingots~
.Ingots are used to make a variety of custom armors.  They are very small
rings that you must collect to construct these armors, or make by melting

@CDESCRIPTION@n

@I This command allows you to introduce yourself to another player.  From
then on they will see you real name instead of your @Eappearance@n.  This
mud strongly encourages roleplaying.

@bYou do NOT have to introduce to a character if you do not want to.  @n
This feature is to foster a roleplaying environment, and bugging someone
who will not introduce to you is out of line.

0 0 23 Introduction~
.You are about to find yourself in the world of the Forests Edge.  If you
have chosen a 'light' race (human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, or ent )
you will begin in Chiiron; other races will begin in Voaleth.  Both
cities have trainers to help you learn your basic skills, and shops to
provide you with essentials.

There are many help files available to you, including help starting and
help newbie.  Please read these and other files thoroughly before asking
others for help.
 
While you are reading, begin to think about your character and their
history; you will need to have an appearance, keywords, and description
approved by an Avatar before you can progress past level 5.
 
Now, press return, and see what wonders there are awaiting you.

only those of that level and higher can see you.
'invis 91' allows avatars and ip's to see you.
~

.~

0 0 1 Invisibility~
.This type of invisibility is passive.  Light is actually 'bent' around
the target.  When you 'see', you are actually viewing rebounding light,
so those that see this way, see nothing.  Be warned, those creatures that
see with other means or which have other senses that are very strong,
will be able to 'see' you.  
~

.~

0 0 1 invulnerability~
.Mages and clerics are generally at great risk from damage during battles
against high-level foes.  This spell allows them to protect themselves
better from area attacks by creating a sphere of invulnerability.
~

.~

0 0 1 ion shield~
.This high-level spell enables a skilled mage to create a shield of
eletric sparks around themselves or another player.  The target is not
injured by the charge, but their opponent receives quite a jolt in
battle.

0 0 7 Kantos~
.@I @EKantos@n, the God of Mountains and Earth, is a very stoic God.  From His
mountain of power in the frigid north, He desires nothing more for His
followers than that they should find the balance and peace that He offers. 
He has only two requirements for service to Him and what He represents,
the first being one of power.  He does not care in what form this power
should manifest itself: might of sword-arm or magic matters not, but the
aspirant should have gained at least the 11th rank of power before
seeking to follow @EKantos@n.  The only other requirement is that the
aspirant should either naturally be, or come to understand and embrace,
the philosophies which mark one as part of the neutral alignment, as this
suits @EKantos@n' will and aims most aptly.  The @CSymbol@n of @EKantos@n is a brown
equilateral triangle which is situated so that only one point is
lowermost.  Halfway down the triangle's height, a line bisects the
triangle horizontally.  Followers of @EKantos@n gain the stamina of this
stolid, earthy God, and when in travelling over earthly terrain their
movement cost is halved, but when travelling in watery areas, their
movement cost is doubled.  Also, to help them discriminate between those
of different ethos, and thus know who might be a mortal foe or valiant
ally, @EKantos@n' worshippers gain permanent detect evil and detect good. 
But as @EKantos@n' philosophy is so earthly his followers lose the ability to
detect magic, or indeed, to ever gain that skill.
~

.~

0 0 7 Kerog~
.Kerog is the god of fury.  He often appears as a tall half-human
half-ogre, though he has no real affinity for any race.  Due to the
disposition of dwarves many do worship Kerog.  His followers are sworn to
a life of battle.  It is unknown what can drive a person to follow Kerog
but many of them have personal vendettas that they ask his aid in.  Kerog
demands his followers to have honor in battle.  This honor forbids them
from attacking the Unaligned or the followers of Taranth.  It also makes
them pay a heavy fee for fleeing from battle.  To aid his disciple's
Kerog grants them permament holy wrath and increases their resistance to
mind attacks as their fury blocks many of these spells.  Only evil and
neutral players may follow Kerog as his untamed temper does not have the
control of good.  Mages and psionics may not follow Kerog as he despises
their weakness.  Likewise Kerog would never approve of a thief due to
their unhonorable ways of battle.  You need to be level 10 before Kerog
would ever accept you.  Due to the solitary ways of Kerog his followers
do not have a chant channel.

0 0 14 Keywords~
.@C@bSYNTAX@n

keyword <list of words> : set your keywords (no commas)

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

@I This command is used to set the words which the player can be
referenced by.  They are only checked if the player is unrecognized and
thus should not include the player's name.  See help @Eappearance@n for
more detail.  Players should give themselves at least @bfour@n or
@bfive@n keywords to avoid confusion.  Keywords should include your
race and everything in your appearance, except prepositions and
conjunctions.  Keywords should not be separated by commas, just spaces.

Example:

@CKeyword slim elf hazel eyes@n

That would set the keywords for an elf mage whose description and
appearance describe him or her as 'a slim elf with hazel eyes.'  Pretty
straightforward, eh?

@eAny unique keywords must be taken from your description, or from an IC
characteristic of your character.  Anachronistic words will not be
approved.

0 0 19 kobolds~
.A race of small humanoids with dog-like heads, the kobolds are a major
nuisance to the dwarves.  The vile little creatures breed and grow at an
obnoxious rate, providing a nearly limitless army of adversaries for any
who try to dwell in the northern mountains.  A kobold den of significant
size exists somewhat to the west of the dwarven citidel of Kha-Da. 
Travellers in the area are advised to use caution as these kobolds are
rumored to be better equipped and trained than most.  If you plan on
touring the northern mountains, it might be wise to talk to a few dwarves
first and find out what you can about the kobolds first, just in case you
should come across them.

command that allows him to do this.  Typing leech alone will bring up a
list of all the spells that the spellcaster has running.  The 'Max Mana:
xxx (yyy max)' is your maximum amount of mana the xxx part is the maximum
available and the yyy part is your total amount of mana.  the 'Regen. 
Rate: xx (yy) is how fast you will regain your energy once again the xx
is your current regen and the yy is your total.  The 'Num' column is the
spell number, this is the number that you would use to stop the spell
from drawing energy from you.  The 'Spell' column is the name of the
spell.  The 'Regen' column shows the amount that the spell is draining
from your Regen.  Rate.  The 'Max' column is the amount of mana a spell
drains from your max mana.  And the 'Character' column shows who the
spell is cast on.

.This is the most basic of the mage's spells designed to help them find a
familiar suited to their disposition.  It can only be cast once per
level, and a mage, of course, can have only one familiar at a time.  The
success of all of these spells requires that the mage have a reagent
designed to attract a specific type of animal.
 
A mage can use their familiar as an aide in battle, but it is more
important in its use as a scout and confidant.  A mage may @Gswitch@n to
take over the body of their familiar and @Greturn@n to return to their
own body.  Exactly what each familiar can do is based upon the specific
animal.
  
Good-aligned Familiars/Reagent
white rabbit - carrot
chipmunk - acorn
small bird - worm
brown squirrel - walnut
brown duck - fish fillet
fawn - blade of grass

.@CSYNTAX@n

@Glist@n        : lists all objects a shopkeeper has to sell 
@Glist@n <item> : lists items matching argument

@CDESCRIPTION@n

@I List gives you a table of all the objects a shopkeeper has, and their
respective costs, levels, number, and condition.  The cost is always
listed in copper pieces, and is based on the @Evalue@n of the object and
how many are in stock.  The level is the minimum level needed to use the
object, and is often low, although the more powerful items tend to have
high levels.

@I The number is the amount of a particular item that the shopkeeper
currently has.  As it varies, the amount that the item is sold for varies
as well; the more items he has, the less they will cost, and the less
items he has, the more they will cost.

@I The condition tells the status of the object.  A @Eshop@n always sells
items in excellent condition, unless an item in need of @Erepair@n has
been sold to it by a player.

@I If an argument is specified it uses the same input as buy so it can be
used to verify you are buying what you think you are.  Thus to see a list
of all shields in a shop you would use list all.shield.

@I*** in the level portion of the list means that either your race,
class, or alignment forbids your use of the item.

0 0 10 lizardmen lizardfolk~
.@GAverage Statistics for Lizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6" - 6'2"

Hair: (you're kidding right?) Lizardfolk don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptilian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Affiliation: more or less neutral with light tendencies.

Appearance: Lacking hair for a description, lizardfolk often employ the
description of various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the way a
snake's scales form interesting patterns, many lizardfolk also develop
patterns.  Most often patterns are recurrent in clan members and are the
primary identifying mark of a particular tribe, clan or familial group of
lizardfolk.  Lizardfolk skin/scales are typically soft and smooth like a
snakes, though wet, fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been
noted before as well.

Lizardfolk have sharp claws that sometimes make grasping and manipulation
a little difficult, but which prove quite useful in unarmed combat. 
Lizardfolk are also lacking lips and can not whistle and must improvise
when calling pets.

Lizardfolk, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid desert climates. 
Lizardmen are not serpentmen, there is a difference.


@GOption Advice for Role Playing Lizardfolk@n

Lizardfolk are typically a fierce yet contemplative people who are
withdrawn in dealings with any other race then their own.  They prefer
the solitude of their own kind whenever possible, but will work alongside
others in times of need.  Within almost every lizardperson a war is raged
at all times between the hot-headed violent nature of brute survival
against the contemplative wisdom of peace.  Most often it is the youths
who are the fighters and warriors of a tribe, their easy anger reigned in
by the wiser, older lizardfolk who act as elder guides.  It is with time
and age that true wisdom and peace are acquired, quenching the rage
within though never stilling the fierce strength that came with it.

Lizardfolk come from a tribal background where many small tribes fought
with each other over territory.  It was not until two tribes managed to
absorb many others and, after a fierce struggle, finally came to terms
with each other and joined as one large clan that their only city of
Sos-kul was built in the Kissk swamp.  Though most have formed into one
homogenized clan, the scale-markings that typically identified various
tribes and familial groups are still pretty pure and a developing caste
system indicates that they will remain distinguishing characteristics for
some time yet.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Lizardfolk are generally a reclusive race preferring to stick to their own
kind.  Despite their misgivings, however, they have come to find that
they can get along well with humans who share the same tendency towards
the balance of light and dark.

Though contact is quite sparse, nearly being on the other side of the
known world from lizardfolk, they do get along fairly well with gnomes
when contact does occur.

Lizardfolk do not get along very well with dwarves due to several
cross-cultural differences and misunderstandings despite the faith they
both place in gnomes.

Lizardfolk do not mix well with elves at all.  Some speculate that this
stems from a past misunderstanding of temporal importance while others
argue that the conflict's roots relate to religious matters.

Lizardfolk have even less tolerance of the elves dark cousins, the vyans. 
Several wars have been fought between vyans and lizardfolk in the past.

Similarly, Lizardfolk do not get along well with orcs, ogres or trolls. 
Continued raids on lizardfolk settlements by these peoples has resulted
in a strong hatred for these races by most lizardfolk.

Lizardfolk do not tolerate the presence of goblins, considering them
nothing more than useless vermin and thieves most notable for their theft
of lizardfolk eggs which they sell to vyans to be trained as slaves when
they hatch.

0 0 9 Llewyrr~
.  The Llewyrr live in the Mighty Vaasa, which lies over a range of
mountains to the northeast of Medienna.  The Vaasa is the mightiest
forest known, and dwarfs all others in its size, age, and grandeur. 
Llewyrr tend to dress in forest colors and have straight hair running
from dark browns to blonds.  Elven eyes are always striking, and come in
more shades and varieties than even those of human.

.  The Llewyrr have come to have very distinct characteristics which have
come to depict them, and them only.  Their general attitude towards life
deviates from that of many others; they believe in the sacredness that
all things: elven, human, animal, plant, rock, or soil.  Only those who
kill or destroy out of reasons other than necessity of survival are
considered lessers.  Over the years, however, there has come to be a
large generalization that all races other than elven kill needlessly and
destroy nature, and so are lessers.  Several radical factions of Llewyrr
have been known to massacare humans and other nearby races for seemingly
no reason.

.  Often it is possible to tell the specific beliefs followed by a
Llewyrr by the beads woven into his or her hair.  This is definately not
true for all though, as many simply choose their own path to follow.

0 0 15 Mage~
.@IA mage is an individual whose intellectual curiousity leads him to ask
questions perhaps better left unconsidered.  Mages typically possess
tremendous mental abilities, and spend a great deal of time in research
and in conducting their experiments.  This generally leaves them with
feeble physical skills.  From their magical training, they learn the
mystical nature of the world around them, and having learned how to shape
this force, they bend the physical world around them to suit their whim
and will.

@IWhile mages tend to start slowly, they are important to any group
because they have such diverse effects.  Simple spells can create water,
food, and light, while more powerful spells can harness natural forces
into bolts of lightning and sheets of fire.  Protective spells, detection
spells, and spells to enhance physical abilities are all learned by a
mage, and with the additional unique and extremely useful @Espell@n of
@Efind@n @Efamiliar@n, a mage is indeed a powerful class.  Mages' spells
are adversely affected by metal, and the more metal a mage wears the more
difficult it is to cast spells.

@ITo see a listing of the spells available to Mages, see the help file on
@GAbilities@n.

@IOther help files that may be useful include help @Emagic@n, @Espell@n,
@Eleech@n, and @Eprepare@n.

0 0 11 Magic~
.Magic in this realm is different from what you might be used to. 
Reagents are required for most all spells in addition to the appropriate
gestures.  To see what spells you can learn at your level, type "abil s". 
If you are a spell-caster you should have at least one spell.  The word
next to the spell describes your profiency at casting that spell.  This
will increase the more you cast the spell.

To find out more about a particular spell, type @b"spell <spell's
name>"@n.  This will give you the lowdown on the spell, listing its
reagents, description, casting time, etc.  To find reagents for a spell,
look around in the wild or visit various shops scattered across the
realms.  Some are commonplace and widely available, and some are quite
expensive and/or difficult to find.

To cast a spell, type @b"cast <spell name> <target>".@n This requires
that you have the proper reagents in your inventory, know the spell at at
least level 1, and have enough energy to cast it.  @bEnergy@n is listed
under the prompt next to the 'e'.  It slowly regenerates up to some max
that increases with level and intelligence.  To see your current max,
type "score".  When you successful cast a spell you will begin to perform
the necessary gestures.  This can take from 1-5 turns.

For mages (and eventually other delvers in the mystical arts), the amount
of metal worn on one's body affects the casting cost of spells in terms
of energy.  This is due to how metal interferes with the magical fields
and forces necessary for the proper casting of spells.  If your spells
suddenly jump in their casting costs, check your @binventory@n; you're
most likely wearing something metal that is to blame.

When spell casters are @bbashed@n (in addition to some other commands) by
mobs or other players, a spell might be disrupted.  Beware.

Some spells are @bleech@n spells, and will remain active until you stop
feeding them energy off of your max.  Type @bleech@n and @bhelp leech@n
to find out more about this.

To find out the specific spells available to a class, type help
@EAbilities@n.  Additional help files that may be useful include
@Espell@n, and @Eleech@n.

.This is probably the first, and certainly the most basic offensive spell
a young spellcaster learns.  With a great deal of concentration, the
caster uses the substance of a pebble to form a missile of pure energy,
which can then be hurled at an opponent to do some substantial damage. 
This spell is often used to train apprentices to focus their power, and
the experience gained from this can lead to more complex, powerful spells.

marmor # <chance> <ac> <part_name>  : assigns values for a body part

@CDESCRIPTION@n

.  Marmor is used to assign armor to non-humanoid monsters.  Each mobile
can have up to 5 different body parts.  For every hit on the mobile the
fight routine rolls a number from 0 to 1000.  It starts on body part 1 -
if the chance for that part is greater or equal to the roll, the hit
occurs on that body part.  If not it then compares the roll to the chance
for the next part.  Therefore the last body part should always have a
chance of 1000.  Ac is the armor value for the body part - if a hit
occurs on the given part, 0-Ac points of damage are absorbed.  For
humanoid monsters set mflag humanoid which causes a default list of body
parts to be used.  
.  Body parts with two words looks much better than just one word. 
Example: warty leg.  Don't make the area name too long.

262144 0 19 Medienne Cemetery/Starkadder Crypt~
.@eDESCRIPTION@n
The gate swings slowly open in a rusty screech of contempt.

A spectre rises up before you!
The spectre says, "Know this:"
@e   "The earth beyond this gate is sworn by blood to a dark power...
   "Mortals are not welcome here, except as sacrifice.
   "Enter at your peril."
@n
The Medienne Cemetery has not served its original purpose in years.  Now,
with the Starkadder Crypt lying at it's center like a black heart, the
graveyard is nothing less than an armed camp.

Though a huge, sprawling area, rumors and tales of veteran adventurers
claim that the crypt beneath the Cemetery is larger and yet more deadly
as it descends into the earth, connecting to both ancient catacombs that
predate Medienne itself, and the lair of the greatest Archimage to ever
live, Croazner the Undying.

plan to leave the trail, be sure to bring along someone experienced in
woodlore and exploring.  For the avid hunter, the woods have produced
everything from quaint little squirrels to ferocious grizzlies.  Among

and abduct them.  How much of it is fact or fiction is not known, but
some brave (or insane) adventurers who have explored the area claim that
indeed many of the tales are true.

0 0 8 Metals~
.@C@bMETALS OF THE REALM@n
  
@bCopper@n
A soft, abundant, easily mined metal, copper is cheapest coin of the
realm.
  
@bSilver@n
Soft and gleaming, silver is rarer and more valuable than copper.  One
piece of silver is worth ten pieces of copper.
 
@bGold@n
Most of the gold of the realm comes from the mines of the industrious
Dwarves of Kha-Da.  Gold is a rare, extremely heavy metal.  One piece of
gold equal ten pieces of silver.
 
@bPlatinum@n
Earlier finders of platinum condemned it as "false silver" and threw it
into the ocean.  They came to learn the value of the hard, light metal,
however.  Platinum is silver-white, is very rare, and quite expensive. 
One platinum piece equals ten pieces of gold.
  
@bBronze@n
Soft, malleable, and plentiful, bronze was the first metal used by
mortals for making weapons and armor.  The practice of using bronze has
not gone out of style, however, because bronze is inexpensive and easily
replaceable.  Bronze is usually impure, thus bronze weapons and armor are
inordinately heavy.  Also, because the metal is so soft, it tends to
blunt easily.  Bronze tends to be easy to enchant.
  
@bIron@n
A heavy, hard metal, iron is the most prominent material used in weapon
making.  It can be forged by even apprentice blacksmiths, and is abundant
enough to be relatively cheap.  Found deep in the earth, iron tends to be
impure, and is therefore heavy.  It does not blunt readily as bronze,
however, so consqeuently is ideal for armor and edged weapons.  Iron is
fairly easy to enchant.
  
@bSteel@n
Steel is iron which has been super-heated to boil out impurities. 
Extremely hard, steel is surprisingly light-weight.  Steel weapons will
keep their edges, and steel armor will not dent easily.  Because only
experienced blacksmiths can work with steel, it is quite expensive.  The
Dwarves generally claim to have discovered steel, as only their mighty
forges could have produced enough heat to draw steel from iron.  Steel is
very disruptive to mage spells, and it tends to resist enchantment.
  
@bElectrum@n
A rare alloy consisting of gold, silver and copper, electrum is
silver-gold in color, is lighter than gold, and is quite soft. 
Therefore, it tends not to last when forged into weapons and armor. 
However, ancient mages discovered that electrum is extremely receptive to
magic, so much so that it does not hinder a mage's spell-casting ability.
  
@bMithril@n
The process of creating mithril is one of the most guarded secrets of the
elves, whose ancients were said to have worn suits of enchanted mithril
chainmail.  However, though no outsiders know how to create mithril, many
know how to forge it.  Several master blacksmiths claim to have learned
the secret of shaping the incredibly hard, lighweight metal.  Mithril is
a bright, almost white, glimmering silver color.  Among metals, it is
second only to adamantite in hardness.  Unlike adamantite, however,
mithril is easier to enchant, although it does hinder a mage's spell
casting ability.
  
@bKrynite@n
Rumors abound concerning the origins of the strange, dark purple metal. 
The most popular of these rumors is that the metal came from an ancient
race of godlings, whose weapons of krynite sank into the ground of the
battlefield where they destroyed themselves in a terrifying war.
Whatever its origins, krynite is undoubtedly magic in nature.  All
krynite exudes a soft, pallid glow, which fades as the metal gets
fatigued.  However, because every pore of the metal is infused with
magic, it will always resist infusions of further energy, such as
enchantment.  Krynite will not interfere with a mage's spell casting
ability.  The metal is incredibly expensive, and so difficult to work
with that only a genius could ever hope to forge it.
  
@bAdamantite@n
Almost nothing is known about this rare, dull-gray metal.  It is said
that those who discovered and could forge the metal have all died. 
Another rumor holds that adamantite is so hard that it can be forged only
with the combination of a giant's strength and archmage's magic. 
Adamantite is second only to diamond in hardness.  A warrior's metal,
adamantite makes incalculably valuable weapons and armor.  It is
extremely difficult to enchant, and is, for mages, the most disruptive
material known.

.This spell is used to enchant a weapon increasing the damage it does and
improving its chance of striking a target, or armor, increasing its
protective qualities.  The effect is permament.  There is a small chance
with this spell that something will go wrong and the object will be
destroyed in the process.

0 0 19 Mist-filled Marsh~
.Long ago, Khutek, the hedge wizard, was practicing a powerful spell
involving calming mists.  Being an inexperienced mageling at the time,
the spell failed, and disastrous environmental consequences occurred in
the marsh where he had been training.  Khutek chucked it up as a learning
experience and moved on.

The enchanted mists still envelop the region south of the Elhanni River
today.  Numerous rumors abound of mysterious creatures that now inhabit
the region, mutated by the magic that Khutek unleashed years ago.

0 0 1 Mists of sleep~
.A more complicated and draining spell than Sleep, this one is greater in
that it conjures forth mists of dizzing light and scintillating colors. 
From this the spell can insinuate itself into the minds of many more
targets in the area.

ubj = "Use Best Judgement"

@CDESCRIPTION@n
 
Following will be a short check list of things to check as you go through
your mobs, to make sure they are complete...
 
level : make sure level is appropriate for area (must be determined
        first) look at similar mobs and set to same level - ubj
hitdice : should equal level (check "help standards" )...fyi, hitdice 
          is the HP on a mob or player(damage player can take)
sex : use best judgement
clan : if mob is meant to be killed unlike human shopkeepers, townfolk
       or whomever, the they should not be set to secomber...i.e.,
       (if killing mob is considered murder in RL, set to secomber)
race : check similar mobs or use best judgement
size : use best judgement
alignment : usually if aggressive, set to evil (but not always...ubj)
mvdice : you don't need to set for a regular mob (horse or such...yes)
coins : look at similar mobs, most mobs won't give much (or any) coins
stats : compare to other mobs, ubj or ask another imm.
resistances : there is a help file, but compare to other mobs (or ubj)
long desc. : use your imagination (but don't make too long)
keywords : if you see unique words in long desc. add them here
main desc. : aim for at least 3 lines long...the longer the better :)
mflag sentinel : stay in room
mflag stay_area : if not sentinel, then have this flagged
mflag summonable : makes mob capable of being summoned by a fellow clan
                   member who has "summon" in their mpcode
mflag has_skel : determines whether the corpse is 'animate dead'-able
mflag wimpy : do you want it to flee during fight?
mflag can_tame : most mobs won't be tameable, ask upper imm.
mflag humanoid : if looks like human (else, see marmor)
mflag aggressive : will this mob attack player when they enter room...ubj
mflag warm_b : if you don't know, ask another immortal
mflag all others : use best judgement (don't go overboard on affects)
marmor : see help file on it...
mpcode : look at my "help standards" file...fyi, mpcode is the attack
         code the mob "performs" on players
  
otherwise, that should be enough, if i left something out...then ask
around...if you follow this, your mob should be fine...although the first
players to kill it won't get experience points until the mob has been
killed a few times.
 
Hope this helps! Enjoy - Dragos

16 0 4 Mobs~
.Following will be an ongoing list of standards for whatever:
  
1) hitdice for mobs: leveld10+10*level
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i.e. for a level 2 mob........2d10+20
- i.e. for a level 15 mob......15d10+150
- Course 50d10+500 is pretty abusive to cpu.  When too many die-rolls are
wanted, 0d0+1000, or 10d25+750, for example, might be better.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2) mpcode damage attacks for mobs: 5x for lower level mobs and 3x for
    upper level mobs(plus an additional 20% random special attack
    totaling 2x.)
This is minimal work.  The higher the mobs, the more mpcode they tend to
need.  Look at the well known high level mobs for examples.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- i.e. 2nd mob...mpcode 1 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "punch" );
- where you get 5x or 5(2) = 10 and 2*4+2 = 10
- i.e. 15th mob...mpcode 1 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "right hand" );
- mpcode 3 attack( mob, victim, 2d4+2, "left hand" );
- mpcode 5 attack( mob, victim, 3d5+0, "spin-kick" );
- mpcode 7 if( random( 1, 10 ) < 3 )
- mpcode 9 attack( mob, victim, 3d10+0, "sonic wail" );
- thus...3x or 3(15) + 2x or 2(15) = 75 = 2*4+2 + 2*4+2 + 3*5 + 3*10
- where the 3d10+0 equals the special attack at the 20% random for 2x in
- the formula
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
let me know if you think we need a standard for anything else for mobs...

0 0 8 mobs_vs_players~
.Far too often we see notes on the bugs, general, and ideas board asking
why mob skills that mimic player skills are better than player skills, or
even demanding that the mobs be better balanced as they have better
skills than the players.
   
This extends to things such as...  My level 10 warrior can only have 2
attacks, so why can the mob I'm obviously better than have 3 attacks? 
...Why can this mage I'm fighting cast a fireball every round yet it take
me several rounds?  ...How can this mob cast lightning bolts at me and
manage to claw me twice at the same time?  ...How can this mob is using a
sword like a fighter, spin kicking me like a monk, and casting a fireball
at me like a mage?
   
Trust me, the mobs ARE balanced to the players.
     
The experience on a mob is automatically determined by several factors,
which include how much damage the mob generally does and how long it
lives.  This leaves only a few options open to us to keep the mobs of TFE
interesting to the players.
- Either we give every mob you come across the same types of armor the
players have, meaning almost everything would have a hodgepodge of +1,
and +2 armor with every slot filled with something.  This would greatly
devalue the cost of equipment and one of the things that we strive for is
to have value placed on valuable equipment, so this is not an option.
- Or we modify their attacks.  Even here a balance must be struck.
  
Since there must be higher lever, more powerful mobs for the more
experienced players to fight they must be able to do enough damage to
provide a threat to people wearing the kind of armor and defensive spells
our high level players use.  To this end TFE has a set of standards to
which the builders adhere when creating mobs.  When a mob is assigned its
level, the standards determine how much life the mob has as well as how
much damage it must have the capacity to deal.  To preserve the value of
equipment, and insure everyone isn't pulling Flaming Mithril Swords of
Death +3 off of the kobolds, this means we modify them and give them
special attacks.  Sometimes this means we will give them a few extra
attacks in the round with mundane weapons, or modify the damage so they
tend to be doing more damage with a mundane weapon then it normally deals. 
For all you know, they are just better trained to use it.
  
Spells...  Not every spell you see a mob cast is exactly what the players
have.  The damaging effects of spells are also a part of the damage
covered under our standards.  If a mob is able to cast a fireball every
round, faster than you, it is only doing the damage it is supposed to and
its experience reward will reflect that.  Perhaps they just cast it
differently and had a better teacher or perhaps they have a better inate
ability to focus magic.  Deal with it.
  
We do try to keep them sensible, but we can not apply the same rules to
the mobs that apply to the players.  Otherwise there would probably only
be a handful of mobs on the mud yielding over 5000 experience.  Even if
that seems like a lot to you now, it won't later.  Later on, when you
need a million exp, or even just a few hundred thousand, and you need to
be killing mobs that yield 10,000 or more exp at a time having mobs whose
skills and equipment are the same as players that yield only a 5000 exp
tops will seem quite boring.  How fun do you think it'd be to kill a
million rabbits over several hours and still not level?  So bear with us,
play, have fun...  But most of all enjoy it.
  
Shade and sweet water,
Talis

Eye Strike, 75, % to blind opponent
Death Slash, 80, 7d5
Ki Whip, 85, Room attack (damages monk and uses mana as well)

A comparison of the monks' damage dealing capabilities will demonstrate
that a monk's average damage will be somewhat lower than warriors under
this system, but the maximum done per blow will generally be appx.  1/3
higher than a warrior of similar level.

Issues of item repair and further skill balance still must be dealt with,
but this is a start.

0 0 15 Monks~
.@IMonks are extremely deadly fighters specializing in unarmed combat.  As
The Forest's Edge is not set in an Asian-type setting monks are not
necessarily analogous to 'traditional' monks, but instead represent
experts at individual, unarmed combat.  Included in their plethora of
physical abilities are the skills of @Etiger paw@n, @Edragon strike@n,
and @Ecritical hit@n, which multiply the damage done on a strike.  Higher
level monks attain the abilities of @Edeath strike@n, and @Edemon slash@n. 
Unable to use armor better than hard leather, monks rely upon defensive
skills such as @Edodge@n, @Eparry@n, and @Eshadow dance@n to provide them
with protection.  @IWhile very weak at lower levels, monks are
indispensible to any group seeking to battle any powerful foe, because
their ability to inflict massive damage is required for victorious combat.

@IFor a listing of the skills available to Monks, please see the help
file on @EAbilities@n.

0 0 7 Morkith~
.Morkith is a major god of darkness, his power riveling that of Morr
himself.  Few have known of this god and even less practice his art of
evil as the requirements to become a dark cleric of Morkith have sent
many an evil cleric to his or her grave.  Morkith is known as the "ever
watching", as it is said that at any time in any place where a supreme
act of evil is taking place, the god himself is watching over it.  Myths
and legends claim that Morkith is the brother of Morr and although they
were quite close at one time, Morkith decided he wanted more power to
himself and challenged Morr to a battle.  The battle is said to have
lasted over thirty decades and was the source of the downfalls of many
kingdoms, plagues and the origin of the animated dead.  After the battle
had ended Morkith was at his brothers mercy but Morr is said to have
taken pity on his brother and instead of killing him, banished him to the
Abyss where he was imprisioned for over ten thousand years.  It is said
that all evil in the land is the doing of Morkith and that the spirits of
those taken by Morr are twisted and distorted by Morkith and cursed to
walk the earth again, doing his bidding.  During the age of Darkfall,
paladins and clerics of the Order of the Phoenix, a clan originating in
the far off land of Tarik Nor, are said to have started a crusade to
banish the temples erected in Morkith's honor and to slay all his
followers.  Whether they accomplished this or not, no one has yet to find
out but it is said that the god has broken free from his binds in the
Abyss and has come back to re-take what was once his.  Sages and scholars
proclaim that when the land of Tarik Nor is found, and the temple of the
Phoenix re-claimed, a new age of darkness will descend upon the land and
ignite the foulest evil beasts in the land to run amuck in the realms, to
turn the land into another Abyss in Morkith's honor.

0 0 7 Morr~
.@IMorr, the omnipresent God of Death, is a god not often spoken of in
polite company, but is whispered about rather tensely in muted voices
around the campires and hearths the realm over.  It is unclear what one
gains from an active life's service to Morr, for the god's followers all
swear an oath of secrecy on entering Morr's service...one would presume
upon completion of a quest, although they will not even acknowldge that
much.
------
There is one major misconception to the powers of Morr, however: Morr,
while his domain does include that of the dead, does not control those
who have passed on into his realm.  Rather, Morr governs the time he will
send one of his dark angels to end a mortal's life.

@B@b*@n Multiplaying is not allowed.  It gives too much of an advantage
over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes soloing and works against
the social structure of the MUD.
   
@B@b*@n Players should not trade equipment between their own characters,
nor assist others in doing so.
   
@B@b*@n The Immortals of The Forest's Edge insist that all players wait
five minutes before logging alternate characters on.  In addition, the
immortals ask that players not log in and out frequently in order to
speed up area resets.
   
@B@b*@n Each account may have only one character on at a time, and
playing multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted.

there is less leniency because it is a physical description.

Here are examples of names that are @bnot@n acceptable:

* Most words in the dictionary except proper names.
* Main characters from reasonably well-known books.  Reasonably well
known is defined as 30% of the mud has heard of the book.  Minor
characters from major works are also unacceptable if 30% of the mud has
heard of the character.
* Names of cities.  Hershey would unacceptable.
* Famous names.  Words strongly associated with anything in particular. 
Dividing line is 30% of the mud recognizes the association.
* Modern names (Rocketman)
* Names including titles (Sir Peabody, Queen Ann)
* Major foreign words.  Major is defined as anything known to whoever is
around.  Anything French is disallowed as the French are annoying.
* Nicknames (names that depend upon the person you are now, or some
physical attribute - lightfingers, stubbytoes, one-eye)
* Bastardizations of any of the above (Frndz, Doonbuggy, Mi-lafs)

Names should be medieval sounding or otherwise similar to a fantasy
setting.  Names are meant to be just that, names.  Nicknames are well and
nice, but they can easily be added to your keywords.  Names should be
things like: Handaran, Aelrynne, Kuhrt, or even Joan.  Adjectives,
adverbs and generally descriptive words are poor substitutes for a name,
Also it is best to avoid names based on verbs like Slasher, Mauler,
Killer.  Such names will only invite a name change.
     
As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars should
politely ask for a name change.  If the person refuses, please talk to or
mail a level 95+ Immortal (rank Immortal, Spirit, Angel, Demigod, God)
about the perceived problem.  Imprisoning the person, freezing them,
disconnecting them is not appropriate.

If the name is offensive, you may either ask them to change the name or
disconnect them immediately.  This decision should be based on the degree
of offensiveness and how reasonable the person is.  Some people do logon
for the sole purpose of causing trouble.

Most importantly, if an immortal asks you to do something (like change
your name) it is assumed they have a good reason and you should comply. 
Imms found abusing this will be dealt with.

   Bignstupid, Jackofclubs, noname, nobody, somebody
 
  
Changing a single letter to make a minor difference is essentially the
same as using the donor name.  Klown will essentially be treated the same
as Clown.  It is a pretty blatant and poor attempt.
  
Reversing a name may or may not work.  No one is going to care about
Maerts, but something like Sesuj is a quick line to getting banned.  It
implies you realize there is a problem with the name, and you are
flaunting that you are trying to get around the rules.  While creativity
is to be admired, flaunting an intentional infraction of the policies is
not.
  
It is not impossible to come up with a decent and original name.
However, if you are going to steal a name from a book:@n
   1) Don't steal obvious names like Bilbo or Gandalf
      steal more obscure people, tertiary characters,  support characters. 
   2) If there's a good chance others will know you, don't contradict
      yourself by making Baba Yaga the orc thief, or Ali Baba
      the human paladin.  If you steal a name, you take with it
      certain concepts and atmosphere.  Don't offer up the concept
      of Lancelot the knight, and try to play him as a goblin mage.

.This skill allows players to wield a weapon in each hand.  Doing so
eliminates the possibility of using a shield or a two-handed weapon, but
given an intelligent choice of weapons it should increase the damage a
warrior can do.  Only dagger type weapons can be wielded in the off-hand,
as two swords, for example, would be completely unmanageable.

The command to use a secondary weapon is : hold <dagger_name>

0 0 10 Ogres~
.@GAverage Statistics for Ogres@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"

Hair: Browns, black, reds and rarely gray.
      It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear, nose, shoulder and back hair are quite common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors that are mainly
      shades of gray.  Sometimes they have hints of red or black as well.
      The Irises are large leaving only a thin margin of the sallow to gray
      surrounding it visible.

Appearance: Ogres are most often quite muscular with odd protuberances,
large warts and cysts most frequently, as well as having frequent patches
of hair-covered warts that can confuse their bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor postures and stoop horrendously.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky
shade of grey-brown, sandy-brown, or a ruddy red-brown but it is always
somewhat rubbery.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ogre@n

As a general rule, ogres are big, mean and dumb.  They are typically
brutish and like to bash anything smaller them as much as possible.  They
particularly don't like little creatures, who tend to cause problems
and/or steal things.  The general attitude of life for an ogre is pretty
simple.  If you can eat it, do so.  If you don't plan on eating it, bully
it.  If you can't bully it, then smash it.

Ogres aren't known as great conversationalists, but they are the favored
workhorse of the dark armies being the best at what is most often called
for in any combat situation.  Smash, rend and tear into itty-bitty pieces.

Ogres have no real central governing force, nor do they care overly much
for family units.  Despite the lack of central cohesiveness, they still
managed to construct a city, Denab-Knur (The ogre words for Cave you live
in, further demonstrating their creative genius).  True to form, city
government is based on strength.  The strong rule and the weak serve.

Two varieties of ogre have evolved here.  Gray ogres tend to be the
stronger and dumber of the two.  Red Ogres, so called for the ruddy hue
of their rubbery skin, are somewhat smaller in stature and possess a
smidge more intelligence than grey ogres, they are still about as smart
as a rock by the standards of most other races.


@yRacial Relations:@n

As a rule ogres dislike anything small.  Halflings, gnomes, dwarves and
goblins are all treated with contempt and should be stomped on repeatedly. 
Goblins, at least, know how to tear things apart and can, on rare
occasion, be useful in breaking something in a small places ogres can't
reach.

Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty dumb even by ogre standards,
make for useful allies.

Orcs are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how to cut and
build things, though they obviously aren't as good as ogres or they
wouldn't be so puny.

Vyans make useful allies, as they make good diversions when hunting elves
and are good at dealing with elven magic.  Unfortunately they are also a
nuisance as they always seem to think they are in charge.  Fortunately
they rarely get in the way of such truly important matters as smashing
things when it comes time to do so.

Elves and lizardmen are hated simply as a matter of course.  They serve
no purpose but they do bleed exceedingly well once you get past all their
silly magic and sharp claws.

Humans are an odd lot.  While some are almost as good as orcs, many more
are often as bad as elves and lizardmen.  Though its usually just easier
to smash them the same as elves, sometimes it pays off to only smash them
a little.  Once they know who's boss, they make pretty good allies.

0 0 0 olddwarves~
.Famous for deeds other than the invention of the braided beard and the
double-bladed axe, the Dwarves of the Forest's Edge are known to make
fine warriors and adventurers.  Strong and hardy, Dwarves also possess a
certain innate resistance to magic which makes members of this race
particularly valuable allies and extremely deadly foes.  The Dwarves of
Clan Khedrun make their home in the great underground city of Kha-Da, and

although they don't much like the annoying brightness which is the sun,
in typical fashion, Dwarves have learned to make do with sunlight, even
if it still irks them.

Dwarves have, in general, an undying hatred for several races - among
them Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and Ogres.  Above all, Dwarves cannot stand
Goblins, who to them are less than worthless thieves who should be buried
alive in the next collapsed tunnel.  Needless to say, Goblins conceive of
Dwarves in similar terms.  Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism,
at times bordering upon open contempt, and Vyans are perceived as a
particularly sinister threat.  Humans, on the whole, are seen as
unnecessarily volatile and a race which really hasn't finished
adolesence, grown up, and figured out what it wants to do with itself. 
Lizardmen are a bit of a boggle for Dwarves, while Gnomes are considered
to be the most agreeable, sensible of fellows, next to other dwarves, of
course.

0 0 0 oldelves~
.
There are two main races of Elves on the Forest's Edge, the llewyrr or
Eleint, and the Vyans, or Dark Elves.  See help @bVyan@n for information
about the Dark Elves.

The Eleint (or "llewyrr") make their home in the grand wood known as the
@bVaasa@n, and seek to rid the forest of evil creatures.  Due to the wood's
great size and the many perilous areas with which it borders, this is a
constant and neverending struggle.

The Eleint are known for their unique style of dress.  They generally
favor forest colors, ranging from deep green to soft browns.  Their hair
ranges from light blond to darkish brown and, rarely, black, with their
skin tone similarly varied.  Also, full-blooded eleint have no facial
hair.  Their hair is typically straight, and the Eleint are known to be
fond of weaving beads into their coifs which represent various aspects of
that particular individual's beliefs, background, family, etc.  The
Eleint typically stand 5' in height, sometimes a bit taller or shorter,
and are slender in girth.  Eye color is varied, with browns and blues
being the most common.

The Eleint have developed a substantial sense of group identity and
cohesion among themselves; some speculate that this is due to their
status as athe children of an 'elder' race, but this is unproven and an
issue of dispute among the greatest sages of the realm.  Nonetheless, the
Eleint are known for their respect given toward the natural world, with
all natural things considered to house a sacred spirit, be they elven,
animal, plant, rock, or soil.

Over the years, however, hard lessons have taught the surface elves to
mistrust outsiders.  Beyond their unmitigated @b@Rhatred@n for all Vyans,
the Eleint possess a healthy suspicion of many races, and have become
outright hostile to others.  Dwarves and Gnomes, though overly
materialistic and concerned with trivialities, are races whose level of
pollution has not yet progressed past their being saved.  Humans, for
their part, are considered to be intemperate and immoderate, prone to
acting first and considering the consequences of their actions later, and
substantial ill-feeling exists between the Eleint and Humans due to
several pastwars and untoward actions, on both sides.

Despite their misgivings with Humanity, the expediency of survival has
forced the Eleint to cooperate - begrudgingly - with humans in the face
of a greater threat.  Posing such a threat are Orcs, Trolls, Ogres, and
Goblins, who along with Vyans are considered as unnatural, twisted
abominations who should be wiped from existence, their very presence an
oozing, infected and diseased wound threatening to destroy the realm.
The Eleint will not associate with these races under any condition,

0 0 0 oldent~
.Ents are large, sturdy, bipedal beings often mistaken at first glance as
being part of the landscape.  However, this @Rdoes not@n mean that they
ARE trees.  Their heads are very tall, and they have hardly any necks at
all.  Their arms are covered with smooth brown skins, and their large
feet have seven toes each.  They generally have long beards which are
bushy and twiggy.  Their tree-like nature makes them slow and ponderous,
though they are not at all sedentary.  Ents are strong and have excellent
constitutions, however, they are susceptible to the forces of nature,
most especially fire.
 
This ancient race's native tongue is very difficult for other races to
learn; but they quite easily have learned elvish.  Besides their natural
friendship with the forest-dwelling elves, ents are also very friendly
with gnomes and lizardfolks.  They have less understanding of the
underground dwelling dwarves, but are not openly hostile.  This good race
has troubles with all of the @Ydark@n races found in the world.

@CWith regard to an ent's appearance and description, keep in mind that
ent's are not trees.  An ent's appearance should reflect the fact that
he/she IS an ent.  While it is acceptable to compare ents with or ascribe
certain traits of trees to ents, neither the description nor the
appearance of an ent should state in any fashion that he/she IS a tree.

0 0 0 oldgnomes~
.
Gnomes are known to be small, industrious, and excellent spell-casters. 
They are comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in a
small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.

In the past, the Gnomes, centered around their great underground city of
Orlumber, have conducted extensive trade with Humans in both Pennan and
Narak.  Sharing a number of traits with Dwarves, Gnomes tend to mix well
with these two races, though not without infrequent misunderstandings and
cross-cultural problems.  To Gnomes, the Eleint are an utter boggle,
their at times inexplicable behaviors utterly mystifying and frustrating
to the members of Clan Thorstag.  Needless to say, Gnomes have had even
less positive contact with the Dark Elves, who in past times have
appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the works of the Gnomes. 
Gnomes tend to have their problems with other races.  Goblins, Orcs,
Ogres and Trolls are prominent on this list, as are Vyans.  Gnomes have a
particular dislike for goblins and categorically deny all goblin claims
that there is any similarity between the races.

0 0 0 oldgoblins~
.Small, tough and wily, Goblins are known for being good at a lot of
things, with the general exception of magic.  Quick and hardy, goblins
make excellent thieves due to their generally high dexterity and small
stature, though persistent individuals have managed in the past to
succeed at a wide variety of careers, including magical ones.

Goblins @b@Rdespise@n daylight, dwarves, elves, and humans, and prefer to
torture and tease any creatures which they may come across.  They also
conceive of trolls and ogres as utterly insufferable, generally because,
like orcs, these races tend to use their superior size and strength to
bully goblins into doing what they don't want to do.  Goblins will not
associate with Dwarves, due to long-standing tensions and a bloody
history between the two races, nor do they particularly like Elves (of
any type).  Dwarves are viewed with outright hatred, due to their
continued butchery of innocent goblins over countless centuries.  "The
only good part of a dwarf is his scalp" states a common Goblin proverb. 
Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to Goblins, who figure that somehow the
two races must be related, with Gnomes of course the lesser relation in
need of help from Goblins.  Why Gnomes cannot learn to take orders and
continue to associate with other, evil races is a source of constant
frustration to Goblins, who would desperately like a new ally (or, even
better, someone they could actually bully).

Most often green, brown or some disgusting combination of mottled earth
tone in skin color, Goblins stand about 4' in height.  They hate light,
live far underground and prefer sharp, stabbing weapons and short, thick
bladed axes which are easy to swing in confined spaces.  Spears are also
a favored weapon.
 
There are generally two varieties of goblins: the generally small, and
more common, green goblins, and the white goblins, a rare variety of
northern goblins which have a tendency to being larger and less chaotic
in their organization.

.

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n
@IHalflings are a race of 'little people.'  They are small, hearty, and
generally cheerful.  Being shy, they often live in small communities
hidden deep within a forest or tunneled far into a distant hillside.
Quick and dextrious, Halflings can move all but silently through nearly
any terrain.

Most Halflings live in their own communities, though they do trade heavily
with Humans and Dwarves.  Halflings are common in the Human cities, often
in taverns discussing adventure over a hearty mug of ale.  Halflings are
fascinated by Elves.  They consider them beautiful and mysterious, though
the Elves' strange customs are an utter cipher to the down-to-earth
Halflings.  Gnomes and Halflings have amicable, if distant, relations.
Goblins and Orcs are hated with a passion by Halflings and meetings
between them are usually short and bloody.  Trolls and Halflings, while
generally at odds, sometimes partner up for mutual benefit.  Ogres
generally avoid Halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large, slow
Ogres.

0 0 0 oldhumans~
.The humans of The Forest's Edge are much like you or me in physical
appearance.  They are used as the benchmark for other races to measure
themselves against, and are known for being solid all-around in their
abilities and professional opportunities.

In the past, Humans have had extensive contact with Gnomes, and have
experienced generally strong relations with them, as much as any
generalization about two groups of such size.  Humans and Dwarves have
fairly strong ties on the whole, while relations between Humans and Elves
have been fairly volatile, as both sides have had trouble understanding
each others' intentions, leading to a series of misfortunes over the past
centuries.

Humans and Orcs do not get along well at all.  Ogres and Trolls are seen
in a similar light, though in the past Ogres have hired themselves out to
humans as mercenaries.  Goblins are viewed as capricious little
troublemakers who are best met with force so they leave humankind alone
and go bother the Dwarves.  Vyans have had very little contact with
humans, and even as Human-Eleint relations are touch-and-go, bordering on
the negative.  To Humans, the Eleint are a strange lot whos kidnappings
and ambushes of humans in the past, together with sometime cooperative
efforts, makes them seem, at best, a schizophrenic race.  Vyans, for
their part, are viewed with extreme suspicion, and in the past those
Vyans unfortunate to be caught by humans have sometimes been burned at
the stake as demons.  As a result, most Human-Vyan meetings tend to be
short andbloody.

0 0 0 oldlizardmen~
.Lizardmen are strange specimens, being large, bipedal reptiles.  They are
strong and sturdy, but slightly lacking in intelligence and dexterity. 
When fighting bare-handed a lizardman does more damage than most due to
their sharp claws, which are large and powerful but do sometimes make
grasping and manipulation of fine objects or details a bit difficult. 
They are unable to whistle though so have to find other means to call
their pets, and sometimes have to find special gear to protect their
hands.

Lizardmen are a generally reclusive race, getting along best with those
of their own kind.  Despite their misgivings, they tend to get along well
with Gnomes and Humans, though they cannot brook Dwarves' behavior
despite the the faith placed in them by Gnomes.  Lizardmen do not mix
well with the Eleint; some speculate that this stems from a past. 
misunderstanding of temporal importance, while others argue that the
conflict's roots relate to religious matters, and the two races' loyalty
to deities with competing spheres of influence.  In any case, Lizardmen
like the Eleint's evil cousins even less, having fought a number of wars
against the Vyans in the past.  Similarly, continued raids upon Lizardman
settlements by Orcs, Ogres and Trolls have initated a hatred of these
races among Lizardmen; for their part, Goblins are despised due to their
theft and sale of lizardmen eggs to slaves, notably Vyans.
 
Lizardmen, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid, desert climates. 
Lizardmen are _not_ serpentmen.

.~

0 0 0 oldogres~
.As a general rule, Ogres are big, mean, and dumb.  They make wonderful
warriors but generally feeble wizards and clerics, due to their innate
tendencies towards high strength and constitution and low intelligence
and wisdom.  Their great size is often of use in combat as well, making
them excellent bashers.  Ogre mages and clerics, rare though they may be,
are not unknown to the realms.

Ogres frequently stand up to 7' in height, and weigh a great deal.  Their
skin is rubbery, and their eyes dull.  Ogres are famous for their great
appetites and fast metabolisms, their rates of regeneration being second
only to Trolls.

Ogres do not like little creatures, who tend to cause problems and/or
steal things.  If they cannot be bullied, they should be smashed.  Humans
can be a similar problem, and dwarves tend to show up at the worst times,
and also merit destruction.  Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty
dumb, make for useful allies, as do the fragile but cunning Vyans.  Orcs
are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how cut things,
while Elves and Lizardmen are hated as a matter of course.
 
There are generally two varieties of ogre: the grey ogre, and the red
ogre.  Grey ogres tend to be somewhat stronger, yet even more dim in the
brain, while red ogres are somewhat smaller, yet possess a fierce,
sinister intelligence.
~

.~

0 0 0 oldorcs~
.A bit slow and a bit dumb, Orcs are nevertheless know to be tough, wily
and strong foes worthy of one's respect.  Slightly larger than a human,
Orcs prefer the dark confines of underground caverns and the hidden
realms of the underworld to the light of day, and will emerge into
sunlight on only the dimest of days, if they can help it, and only after
expressing their dismay at having to suffer from 'that accursed
brightness.'

Orcs are known to be none too fond of Elves, particularly the Eleint,
whom to Orcs are only valued for their skins and teeth.  Orcs begrudingly
respect Vyans, due to their continual warfare with and mutual hatred
toward the Eleint.  Dwarves and Gnomes make excellent slaves, food, or
both.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres as well as Goblins, whom
they frequently like to bully (with varying amounts of success).  Orcs
and Trolls tend not to get along well at all, except when hunting the
accursed Eleint (Trolls being insufferable bullies).

Not the strongest spell-casters, Orcs are known to be excellent warriors
and thieves.  They have, however, been known to succeed in whatever
profession they might choose to pursue.
 
There are two basic varieties of orc: the eastern orc, and the western
orc.  The eastern orcs tend to be more chaotic and tribal, while the
western orcs are somewhat larger and more intelligent.
~

.~

0 0 0 oldtrolls~
.Trolls are big and slow.  Make that @bBIG@n.  Known for their prowess in
battle, their superior physical attributes, and their great size, Trolls
are known to be unsurpassed warriors.  Along with these physical traits
comes a particular dimness of mind and of senses, and Trolls able to cast
spells are rare, and often less than competent.

Trolls' metabolisms are famous as well for their speed;
they regenerate much more quickly than other races, and consequently
must eat a great deal more to satiate their great stomachs.

As a thoroughly subterranean race, Trolls are adversely affected by
therays of the sun.  They rarely venture forth to see the light of day,
only doing so at night, or on those cloudy, dim days when the sun is at
its weakest.  Trolls fear fire, for its affects harm the race to a great
extent, and slows their recuperative capacities.

As citizens of the underground world [Note: now under construction],
Trolls live in loosely-organized clan bands which meet with other bands
("nations") at regular intervals, holidays, etc.  Trolls generally get
along well with one another, and frequently associate with Ogres, as the
two races are frequently of like mind.  Trolls perceive Vyans as
untrustorthy schemers, though useful allies in dire circumstances. 
Goblins make useful servants, and Orcs often function as valueable allies
while hunting (and, they hope, skinning) the vile Eleint.

Like surface elves, Dwarves and Gnomes are intolerable and utterly
disgusting to Trolls.  Gnomes are utterly insufferable to Trolls, who
cannot understand their lack of appreciation for the fine art of mindless
destruction and cold, dark places.  Humans are a puzzle to trolls - some
make great allies and comrades in arms, while some are just as bad as the
worst Eleint.  The fact that humans have hunted trolls for body parts in
the past, along with gnomes, does nothing to improve relations.  Trolls
credit Elves with making a fine stew.
 
There are generally two varieties of troll: the southern, or swamp,
troll, and the northern, or ice, troll.

.~

0 0 0 oldvyans~
.The Vyans, or Dark Elves, live underground in their shadowed realm, far
from their hated cousins, the Eleint.  Long ago, the two clans (some
might say races) were one, but even this is cloaked in legend and rumor. 
Vyans can only barely stand the light of the sun, having since time
immemorial spent their days in the dark, sunless recesses of the earth,
*miles* from the Earth's surface.

Vyans and surface Elves possess an unmitigated hatred for one another, a
conflict whose origins are clouded in myth and rumor.  Known by surface
races as "Dark Elves", the Vyans return the suspicion and intolerance
shown then by Human, Gnome and Dwarf alike.  Similarly, while Vyans have
in the past cooperated with Ogres and even Trolls in times of crisis,
this is a race which is generally reclusive and suspicious - some might
say outright hostile - to outsiders.  Lizardmen are considered to be a
less developed race by Vyans, suitable only for enslavement and
indefinite servitude.  Just as Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Gnomes have
tortured and slain those Vyan unfortunate enough to fall into their
hands, so too are the Vyan known for their merciless destruction of
prisoners of said races.  The Vyan neither asks for, nor gives, quarter.

Contrary to popular surface-dweller belief, Vyans are not all
dark-skinned and white-haired creatures.  Their skin tones do indeed
vary, from a dark midnight hue to a pale, wan color some say results from
untold ages spent beneath the earth's crust, far from the burning light
of day.  Slender in build, Vyans stand about 5-5'6" in height.  Their
eyes are most often violet or even amber in hue, but albinos, as well as
other odd colors,reputedly occur among the Darkest Folk.

0 0 10 Orcs~
.@GAverage Statistics for Orcs@n

Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"
        females about 5' - 6'6"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greatest of manes.  What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Occasional shades of dark brown or
      the infrequent shade of ruddy reddish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises.  The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Affiliation: orcs are a dark race.

Appearance: Orcs frequently have dusky-hued skin tending towards shades
of brown or red.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's more pathetic than smooth, boring skin.

Orcs are not known for their great dental hygiene and often have cracked,
yellowed and missing teeth.  Fortunately for them they often grow back
missing teeth once lost.  Enlarged tusk-like canines often protrude from
the lower jaw noticeably.  Their noses are typically upturned, giving them
a pig-like or boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of the
so-called good races.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Orc@n

Orcs are typically slow and a bit dumb, never the less they know how to
be tough, wily and strong foes worthy of respect.  Orcs primarily dwell
underground and, though they can tolerate sunlight, prefer not to and
will assuredly whine at being made to spend time in the light.  Their
long years of growing as a society in the cramped tunnels and caves left
to them as the hand-me-downs of larger, brutish dark races or the more
cunning vyans has produced some pretty strong traits.  Most orcs are not
shy or withdrawn and prefer to take what they can get.  This makes for a
very combative society and one that has learned to take its own abuse. 
Their favorite hobby would have to be tormenting the goblins that somehow
always manage to be present wherever there are orcs.  Its considered
great sport, after all, they just keep taking the abuse and there are
always more.
After years of living this way, orcs finally came into contact with
humans.  Though brutal at first, some orcs did see the advantage to
living above ground in artificial caves (houses), particularly if you
build them without windows, thus keeping sunlight out.  When this faction
left, leaving more space in the caves, the remaining orcs rejoiced
greatly and proceeded to fight over the extra free space.  The split, over
many years, has caused orcs to evolve into two main groups.  An eastern
orc, seen most commonly around Voaleth, who tend to be more tribal,
chaotic and senselessly brutal.  And a western orc, seen most commonly
around Brithbarad, known to be somewhat larger and more cunning in their
brutal plots.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Orcs are known to to be none to fond of elves, finding their best value
to be the way they bleed so easily when cut, pounded or smashed.
Elves are also a good supply of elven teeth, which make fine keepsakes of
memorable raids on the unwary elf hunting party.

Despite their close resemblance to elves, orcs grudgingly respect vyans. 
After all, how bad can a people who slaughter elves even more than you do
be?

Dwarves and gnomes only have value as slaves, food or both in orcish eyes.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres, seeing them as little
more than really large orcs.

Goblins, having turned out to be poor slaves who were too weak and lazy
as workers and too inconsistent in work quality, and about as hard to get
rid of as roaches turned out to be almost adequate allies.  They make for
great fodder in a fight and are a nearly endless source of mirth as the
butt of jokes and target of cruelty.  They just keep taking it and there
are always more.  When you break one, there always seems to be two more
ready to take its place.

Orcs and trolls do not tend to get along well at all, always managing to
find something to fight over (usually involving possessions or food),
except when hunting elves.

Humans are an odd lot and are alternately tolerated and hated by orcs
depending on whatever the current leaders' whims seem to be.  Where some
humans serve the dark forces they tend to make good allies, while humans
that serve the light are bothersome nuisances and frequently go the way
of elves.  Which is to say they end up a smear on some orc's war club.

Lizardfolk remain a nearly complete enigma.  They lived in the swamps
and, as everyone knows, there aren't caves under a swamp, just more swamp. 
Worse than that, there are only two ways to get there.  Through human
lands, and the humans keep stopping orcs to fight or talk, either one is
better than walking all day.  Or through the Vaasa, and there are just so
many elves to kill there's never a good enough reason to get to the other
side of the Vaasa.  Why go through when you can stop half way and just
keep killing elves until you're ready to go home?

0 0 7 Osse~
.Osse, the god of the sea, is a violent and powerful god.  To those
who chose to follow him, Osse grants the ability to breathe underwater,
as well as prevents them from being pkilled by other players while in his
world.  Also, a player that is killed while underwater loses a lesser
amount of experience when he or she dies.  And as master of water, Osse
also has powers over ice and steam, and grants the ability to those
spellcasters who follow him to learn new spells special to followers of
Osse.
 
Also known as: the Great Navigator, the Master of Waves, and the Ice Lord.
 
There is rumored to be a shrine to Osse near Medienne.

0 0 15 Paladin~
.@IIn the beginning, temples were easy targets, so they hired warriors and
fighters to protect them.  Over time, these temple protectors not only
came to practice their arts of war, but also became devout to the
temple's god.  In this way, they became the strong arm of the church,
where their unique combination of skills were needed.  Hence, the Paladin
was born.
@IBecause of their devotion to a god, paladins gain a wide assortment of
simple spells.  Useful spells such as create light, food, water and other
curative spells are complimented by the more powerful spells of @Eremove
curse@n, and @Esanctify.  However, gaining these benefits cost these
paladins to lose some of their formidable warrior skills.  They cannot
hit quite as often as true warriors, but they learn the powerful skills
of @Eturn undead@n and @Elay hands@n.  This mixture of spells and skills
make Paladins a very powerful class, one that relies less on others for
survival in a harsh world.

@ITo see a listing of the abilities and spells available to Paladins, see
the help file on @EAbilities@n.  Other help files that may be useful
include @Ehelp spell@n.

0 0 12 Parry~
.Parry is a skill which allows you to block some of an enemy's attacks. 
It is most effective with a sword or other long weapon, though daggers
and other short weapons or fists can be effective to a lesser extent.

This is a passive skill, in that there is no need to type in any command
for an attempt at parry.

NOTE: This skill is not the same thing as the "parry" option.  See @Ehelp
options@n for more information on the parry option.

0 0 4 pet_rules~
.Pets can be a lot of fun and good helpers in the realm.  However, they
can also be horribly abused.  Pets are any mob following you that you
have control over that is not you.  Familiars, mounts, animals/living
things bought at pet stores, and animals/living things tamed by ranger
pet spells, and created/owned undead are all considered pets. 
Unfortunately there's also room for abuse where pets are concerned, so
here's a little lit of what not to do 
(some of these things can get you banned).

@C
You are not allowed to aquire pets with the intent to release them later
to kill them.
  @C-This means no wounding pets, making them sleep, releasing them, killing them.
  @C-This mean no taming a pet to remove it from the safety of its guardians.
    @C(ie taming sheep to remove them from Pennan to kill them elsewhere)
 @C-This also means no taming the white timber wolf to remove her from her mate
   with intent to release/kill her so you can tame her mate.
   @C(a hint, there IS a legal way to achieve taming the male)

You are not allowed to send them into battles you are not a part of.
  @C-In particular this means no sending hords of pets in to kill shop keepers
   while you stand idly by and watch them get killed by the keeper and guards.
   Honestly, what keeper/guard wouldn't notice you give the orders and attack
   you?  The code just can't handle that yet, so its not allowed.
@n

The imms can see when you aquired pets, when they are released and when they die.
It looks awfully suspicious to check your player log and find you die
once to every 20 pet deaths.  It looks equally suspicious to see you
tamed a dozen animals and released them shortly thereafter.  In fact,
that looks more like you're moving them elsewhere to be killed or killing
them yourselves.
Granted, pets will die, but there's a difference between reasonable
chance of death and abusing the options given you.  In particular this
occurs with rangers.  A ranger's communion with nature allows them to
tame the pets.  I would hate to see tame end up like familiars, only one
tame per level, becuase rangers are abusing it.  -Talis

0 0 8 Phule's Laws~
.TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to The Forest's Edge
get their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you
start your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!
@I
@I Law 1: Self-Preservation.  Set your @bwimpy@n.  What "wimpy" does is
engage a sense of self-preservation in your character.  Typing "wimpy
flee 8" will get your character to try to start running away whenever he
(or she, of course) is beaten down to 8 hit points.  Setting your wimpy
has Phule's personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but
remember, don't simply rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot. 
@bFlee@ning (typing "flee") will also get you to protect your tender hide.
@I
@I Law 2: Con before kill, look before you leap.  Before you even *think*
about attacking a mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To
do this type "con monster_name" -- perhaps "con goat" -- and hit enter. 
This will make your character "consider" his/her chance of success
against that monster in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you
come accross, type "kill monster_name." Also, before you wander into
unknown territory, type "scan." This will get your character to look
around the general area and see if there are any monsters lurking about. 
If scan shows that there is an evil newbie-eater to the east, don't go
east.
@I
@I Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were
feeling hungry or thirsty.  Here at TFE you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers
and brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food
can be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type "eat bread" or "drink fountain" to eat and drink.
@I
@I Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type "skin corpse"
after the fight has ended.
@I
@I Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
at TFE, you need to @bpractice@n and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you
much good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters)
have been around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type "prac" in
a room where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught
there, a list of skills will appear.  Type "prac skill_name" to train
inthat skill.  Type "abil" to see a list of your abilites which can be
learned.
@I
@I
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Remember, if all else fails and you find yourself killed until dead,
Death might give you a second chance to gain revenge on the
slavering-fanged monster which sent you packing to the netherworld. 
Chances are your corpse will sill be laying around with your equipment in
it.  Happy MUDding!!

0 0 4 Polearms~
.As there has been some confusion as to exactly what polearms are, this
should help to clear it up a bit.  Polearms, historically, were long
(6-15 feet) weapons used by ground troops to take care of knights on
horses.  However, since we haven't quite gotten mounted combat ready yet,
you aren't going to see too much of this.  Polearms had a lot of variety. 
Some types were built for bashing, other has piercing tips, and some were
just giant cleavers on sticks.  A few polearms incorporated two or three
of these into one weapon.  Again, sad to say, we haven't quite got that
worked out yet either, and right now, all polearms will be of the
slashing variety.  Give us time...  we'll figure something out.

0 0 8 Policies~
.@bPlayer Names@n - Players should choose a name that fits their character
and the medieval time period.  Immortals are encouraged to be lenient in
enforcing this, but characters with blatantly unacceptable names will be
asked to change them.  Examples of unacceptable names are Television,
GoBlue and IamGreat.

@bImmortal Help@n - minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed unless in cases of bugs. 
Both players and immortals will be disciplined for this.

@bAbusing Bugs@n - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bugs can
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for
such abuse.  If it is too good to be true, it probably is, and you'd
better report it.

@bReimbs@n - Reimbursements may be given in some cases for losses due to
major bugs.  The normal reimbursement is the equipment you had as of the
last backup of the player files.  This may not be all that you lost but
eliminates the problem of lying so no other equipment reimbursement will
be given.  Deaths or losses due to lag are not eligible for
reimbursements.  Items lost in a crash are not eligible for reimbursement
unless they were lost on a corpse.

@bMulti Playing@n - Multi Playing is not allowed.  It gives too much of
an advantage over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes solo'ing and
works against the social structure of the mud.  Similarly, players should
not trade equipment between their own characters, or assist others in
doing so.  Each account may have only one character on at a time, and
playing multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted. 
Multiplayers may reasonably expect themselves to be purged.

@b5-Minute Rule@n - A corollary to the rule against multiplaying.  This
rule applies to those players with more than one character.  To switch
playing one character for another, you must wait AT LEAST five minutes
before connecting as the new or 'second' character.

@bDeath Traps@n - Death traps ruin the fun of exploring and make life
frustrating.  Areas will not contain 'automatic death' traps.

@bLanguage@n - We ask that players not curse or use offensive language. 
While it is impossible for Immortals to monitor all channels all the
time, we ask that you police yourselves and that you please be sensitive
to your company, both those in the room with you, in the area, and on the
mud as a whole.  Players have complained about this in the past, and
minors do log on here.  Please be considerate to others during your stay
at The Forest's Edge.

@b"Bots"@n - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension. 
Bots, or automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the
human element from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive
series of scripted actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we
seek to foster at The Forest's Edge.  As a result, players are not
permitted to run or use bots.

0 0 3 Policy_1~
.
Player Names - Players should choose a name that fits their character. 
Immortals are encouraged to be leniant in enforcing this, but characters
with blanantly unacceptable names will be askd to change them.  Examples
of unacceptable names are Television, GoBlue and IamGreat.

Immortal Help - minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed unless in cases of bugs. 
Players will be punished minorly for excepting help and immortals will be
purged.

Abusing Bugs - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bugs can
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for
excessive abuse.

immortal in anyway.

practice         : sees what you can learn where you are
practice <skill> : practices specified skill

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Practice is the command used to pay a trainer to improve you in a skill. 
Practicing costs gold and experience points.  In most towns there are
trainers who can teach you the basic skills, but it may not be obvious
who they are.  An example is Prenslie in Chiiron can train some spells. 
Skills and spells above level 15 generally must be sought after outside
of towns.

@R**See 'help practices'(with the 's' for info on the change).**
~

.~

0 0 8 Practices~
.@bPractice Points: @n
Practice points may be gained according to the following criteria:

@Ias "bonus" practices, gained while leveling;
@Ior when a skill is used successfully;
@Ithey are not determined by XP gain;
@Ievery so often, one has a chance to gain a prac if he or she uses a
@I   skill successfully;
@Ione's chance to gain practice points is modified by INT and WIS.

INT and WIS also affect the maximum number of pracs which your character
may possess at any one time.  ("The Grey Matter Quotient", also affected
by level.) 

@bFor example@n:
Bob "Genghis" Khan goes about fighting critters, in his battles he uses
skills he already knows.  Bob "Genghis" Khan then gains a practices point
because he is using his skills and has a high wis and intelligence.  Then
after a while again he gets another, becuase his situation met the above
criteria.  Bob "Genghis" Khan can then use those practices once he has
found a teacher and practice any skill which is available.

pray : calls on the gods to assist you

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

If you are in dire need you can try praying for assistance.  The gods of
the game might intervene on your behalf if you have been leading a pious
lifestyle and have not been calling on them too often.  This command does
not contact player gods but instead the god of your religion.  Some
sample needs are light, food, water, and hit points which the gods may
give you in response to your prayers.  The command takes no argument and
your god determines what you are in need of.

Currently, players of Chaotic Evil alignment are forbidden from praying.

There are several causes of this but the most common one is you having

0 0 8 procedures~
.Any good policies help file is always followed up by a good procedures
help file.
   
@CIf you need an immortal@n,, ask on gossip first.  If they do not respond it
is because they are busy.  Asking through tell first, or after they do
not respons on gossip is both bad form and likely to make the imm irate
(remember, they're already busy or they would've answered your gossip).
 
@CIf you need approval of your appearance, keywords, and description@n, ask on
OOC.  The Avatars (noted by the AV next to their name on the who list)
handle that.  Asking on gossip is a waste of time, as no one will know
who you are on gossip and the AVs are listening to the OOC channel in the
first place.
  
@CIf you have a disagreement with an immortal@n on policies or anything
else of importance, don't argue, it only makes things worse (and remember
they can ban you, not the other way around).  If you feel you have been
unfairly treated, wait until you can get in contact with a higher level
imm and @bexplain@n your situation to them (don't whine or complain,
think before you speak).
  
@CHow Immortals deal with people@n:
  -Generally you will get a warning for the first offense
  (unless what you did was truly bad in which case you may just get banned).
  -If you have been warned about something before, and you are caught
   breaking the rules again, this does not mean you will get a warning
   before being banned.  Getting caught a second time is cause
   enough for immediate banning.
  
@CIf you ask an imm something and they say no@n, do not bother going from
imm to imm until one says yes.  If you honestly feel the imm is wrong,
see 'If you have a disagreement with an imm' above.  Otherwise, you are
only setting yourself up for failure.  Each player has a player file on
which the imms put little notes (player was caught stealing, name was
changed, etc) If we catch you playing, "If mommy says no, I'll go ask
daddy and maybe he'll say yes", then it gets noted on your player file as
well, and any arguments on your point will probably be viewed as somewhat
surreptitious by imms from that point on.
    
@CIf you need help doing something@n:
  -If it is in-game, ask another player through say, gossip or chat.
   In-game includes things like:
      I am hungry, where can I get food?
      How can I earn money?
      What are the best things to kill for experience?
      How do I get more practice points?
   
  -If it is out-of-game and game related, ask on ooc or gossip.
   If it requires an imm, see 'contacting an imm' above.
   Out-of-game includes things like:
      What temperature do I cook pizza at? (on ooc)
      How about that local sports team? (on ooc)
      What exactly does our Dexterity do for our characters? (ooc)
      Is there an imm free? When I logged on all my stuff was missing.
          (this asked on gossip, await response from an imm if available)

0 0 1 Protect life~
.This spell attempts to transfer the subject out of danger the instance
before they die.  It takes a large toll on the caster in mana and
regeneration, but is very useful when entering unknown areas.  Due to its
nature and the uncertainty of death this spell is difficult to get right
and is often known to fail, especially when cast at lower levels.  In
contrast objects will the same affect have a much lower failure rate. 
There is one other warning that should accompany this spell, when the
victim suffers a death delivering blow and the spell successfully saves
them, the energy drain from the caster can cause massive injuries.
~

.~

0 0 1 Protection Plants~
.
This ranger spell enables the caster to call upon their special link with
the out-of-doors and further protect themselves from damage when fighting
monsters from the world of plants.  Although limited in the types of
monsters it works against, this spell is very effective against leafy
foes.

.Devout souls who worship good gods are able to learn to protect

Punching is much like a brawling skill.  It increases the amount of
damage that you inflict in unarmed combat with punching attacks.  This
skill, however, does not increase the damage inflicted by monk special
attacks.  Nevertheless, it is a very important skill for monks, as even

0 0 0 pwipe~
.Yes, there has been a player wipe.  This was done for several reasons. 
The two most prominent and pressing reasons were a great deal of new code
(evidenced by all the bugs) and a desire on the part of all the imms to
better balance equipment and classes.  Although it is possible the first
could have been compatible with an existing playerbase, the second really
could not have been done.  Restarting also affords us the opportunity to
stress role-playing here, something that was lost along the way before.

This was done suddenly, yes.  It surprised all the imms as well as the
players.  I don't doubt there may have been more 'pleasant' ways for this
to have been accomplished, but it is done.  We hope that when we are all
finished our work, you find the new TFE an even more enjoyable place.

For the short term, code is buggy and changing.  All characters are
temporary, and will be wiped when we are ready to go.  Greyclaw has
kindly left the mud up so you all don't suffer from withdrawal.  Your
first death is also your last.  Play, chat, have fun, and please, don't
whine.  Post NEW bugs to the bugs board, and find things you can do. 
Experiment with classes and races and stats.  Decide what you want to be
in your next life.  When we are officially back, old players who want to
use their old names (assuming they conform with stricter standards) will
be given back their names.

All the imms are working very hard to make the game playable, and a bit
different then before.  Please don't disturb them, it only will delay our
grand re-opening.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Qedit is used to create a quest and assign a certain number of quest
points to it.  Players can be in one of three states regarding each quest
on the quest list; 

1. They have had nothing to do with the quest yet.
2. They have been 'assigned' the quest but have not yet completed it.
3. They have completed the quest and recieved the points for it.
  
To change a player's state from one state to another, action, mob and
object programs are used.  Assign_quest, and Update_quest within the code
commands will change the player's states, and has_quest and done_quest
can be used to test the state of the player regarding that quest.  (See

.Deep in the heart of the Vaasa, near a forgotten stream, a few families
of elves have built a small village to live their lives in peace and
harmony with nature.  Three generations of families live together,

giants of Hark's Finger loom nearby, the elves have thus far been able to

.To help people figure out what things are required to be in or left out
of their appearance and desc, based on their race I came up with a
compendium of information for the races.  Unfortunately, it gets a bit
long.  To help facilitate the two, I've divided the list into @bracial_dark@n
and @bracial_light@n.
these are not necessarily mandatory, but they should give you an idea
what the normal is.  Where something is mandatory it should be somewhat
notable (ie elves don't grow facial hair, ents are not trees, all dwarves
grow facial hair (notice I said grow, not have) ).

.The listing of racial traits for those races that serve the darkness:

@g- - - - -@n
@YHumans@n

The basic race type, we should all be familiar with this one.

Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average
        Female about 5 feet- 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@g- - - - -@n
@YVyan@n

Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"     (' means feet)
        female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)

Hair: typically stright. Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      brown or blond (extremely rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Though other colors such as brilliant blues
      or grays to black are not uncommon.

Note: Skin tones range primarily from midnight black to pale, wan colors. 
The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is almost completely
unheard of.

Note: Vyans age very slowly.  You probaby won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOrcs@n

Height: males about 5'2" - 6'6"
        females about 5' - 6'6"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greates of manes. What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Ocassional shade of dark brown
      or the infrequent shade of ruddy redish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises. The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Note: Orcs frequently have dusky-hues skin tending towards shades of
browns and reds.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's worse than plain smooth, boring skin.

Note: Orcs have poor dental hiegene but also have hearty teeth that often
grow in once lost.  Enlarged, tusk-like canines often protrude from the
lower jaw noticably.  Noses are often upturned, giving them a pig-like or
boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of so-called good
races.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOgres@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'4" - 7'2"

Hair: Ogres have hair most frequently in browns, blacks, and reds
      and rarely gray.  It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear and nose hair as well as shoulder and back hair are common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors of mainly
      greys.  Sometimes hints of red or black have appeared though rarely.
      Irises are large leaving only a little of the sallow to gray
      surrounding the eyes visible.

Note: Ogres are often muscular, but odd protuberances as well as frequent
patches of hair-covered warts can confuse the bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor posture.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky shade of grey-brown,
sandy brown, or ruddy red-brown and is always somewhat rubbery.

@g- - - - -@n
@YTrolls@n

Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"
        females about 6'6" - 7' 6"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to black hair, not always on their
      head.  Where hair grows it is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls tend to have white hair, with at least
      some on their head more so than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.

Note: Trolls have green skin in varying hues (though none are what would
be termed bright, neon, or electric green), They are often warty or have
cancerous appearing growths though these do not seem to affect their
health negatively in any way, rather it appears to be an excess of their
ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost never have scars, as they heal so
incredibly well.  For a race that is typically foul, corupt and evil they
have the incongruous gift of incredible regeneration at the cost of a
never-ending hunger.

@g- - - - -@n
@YGoblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6" - 4'4"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      What hair they do grow is usually black or brown and often
      caked in muck and fiflth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are primarily
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown or reddish-brown.  The iris extends to the edge
      of the eye with only a pupil which dilates between a pinprick
      in size to a large circle as lighting permits.

Note: Goblins have craggy skin in colors of earthy greens and browns or
patchy/mottled earthtone mixes.  Though they have warts and protuberances
less frequently than orcs, ogres, and trolls they are not completely
infrequent in some clans.  Goblins tend to have sharp teeth, though they
are small and wouldn't ordinarily be called fangs.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHumans@n

Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average
        Female about 5 feet - 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@YElves@n

Height: male about 4'8"-5'8"    (' means feet)
       female about 4'6"-5'6"   (" means inches)

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white / blond ) to darkish brown.
      black (very rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue.  Though other colors such as amber
      lavender, or other light colors are not uncommon.

Note: Elves have skin tones that range in most human ranges but almost
always touched with a healthy glow from sunlight.  Elves almost never
have pale or sickly looking skin.

Note:Elves age very slowly.  You probably wont see wrinkles Before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

@g- - - - -@n
@YDwarves@n

Height: male and female about 3'6"-4'6"

Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown and
      blond are rare.
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.
      (they 'could' be shaved odd daily, but such dwarves
       should be ostracized by imms/players at every given
       chance.  freaks. :P )

Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and blue (rare) iris.
      White around iris, though iris is large.

Note: All dwarves grow facial hair.

@g- - - - -@n

@YEnts@n

Height: males about 6'6" - 7'6"
        females about 6'10" - 8 feet tall.

Hair: Bristly or "twiggy" in earth tones.
      Dark-light browns, grays, blacks, ruddy reds,
      sandy-blonds.  Most ents also have "twiggy" beards.

Eyes: also earthy colors. blacks, grays, browns and green
      predominate though silver and green are not unheard
      of.  Iris extends to edge of eye, no whites.

notes: ENTS ARE NOT TREES.  Imagine a troll with brownish, craggy skin
though not slimy or warty.  That's an ent.  They don't have leaves, they
don't bleed sap.  Ents have 7 toes on each foot, though this need not be
put in description.  Most ents have beards.  Ents have big heads.

@g- - - - -@n

@YGnomes@n

Height: male about 3'6" - 4'6"
        female about 3'4" - 4'4"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blonde and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black
      large irises surrounded by white.  As the irises are
      large, so are the pupils from years of time underground.

Note: Skin tones run through all normal human ranges, though tend more
ferquently to duskier hues.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHalflings@n

Height: males about 3'2" - 4'
        females about 3'2" - 3'10"

Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blonde or reds.  Black (rare)
      Facial hair is rare at best.

Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.

Note: Halflings appear much like human children though they do develop
wrinkles, graying hair and other adult attributes.  Halflings often
develop a stout build, some say due to the 5 regulated meals a day they
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend. 
Halflings are not hobbits.  We aren't going to ban you for having hairy
feet, but realize, it is not the norm.

@g- - - - -@n
@YLizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6" - 6'2"

Hair: (you're kidding, right?)  They don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptillian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Notes: Lizardfolk, lacking hair for descriptions, often employ the
descriptions of the various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the
way a snake's scales form interesting patterns, the lizardfolk develop
patterns in many tones.  Included are clans with anywhere from subdued,
earthy tones to ones with vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow. 
Lizardfolk skin is typically soft and smooth like a snakes, though wet,
fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been noted before as
well.

0 0 15 Ranger~
.@IRangers are outdoorsmen and wandering types who operate beyond the
boundaries of society.  They feel at home with nature, and do not remain
for long in civilized parts, preferring instead to spend their days
surrounded by nature.

Due to this self-reliant streak, Rangers have a wide variety of skills
available to them, including a number of useful spells and several unique
abilities which relate to their experience with and knowledge of the
natural world.  Among these are the skills @ETrack@n and an improved
version of @EScan@n, which makes a ranger an invaluable scout and ally of
any group, and the spell @ETame@n, through which a ranger may befriend an
animal encountered in the wild.

Rangers make strong fighters, and while they do not have as wide a
selection of armor and weapons as fighters and paladins, they can deal
damage extremely well and stand in the front rank as a substitute when
necessary.

@I For a listing of spells and spells available to Rangers, please see
@Ehelp Abilities@n.  Other help files that may be useful include
@Espell@n.

16 0 4 Rdesc_Standards~
.Room descriptions are just that: @bdescription@n.  They are not
narration, they do not tell stories, give players history, gossip, or any
information which they could not obtain from standing in a spot and
examining their surroundings.  It is the players' job to make inferences,
even the most basic, and put together the raw data.  Rdescs assume
nothing.

Rdescs define rooms; they are the firmament of The Forest's Edge, and
should only include the @bpermanent@n traits of the room.  Referring to
an ogre's breath in the next room is not appropriate in an rdesc; if the
ogre is killed or out at the local sports bar, this descriptive detail
would not make sense.  [This example would be more appropriately handled
as an action which used the mob_in_room function to check if the ogre was
present in his lair.] Similarly, things like weather conditions, time of
day, etc. are equally inappropriate.

Rextras should be provided for prominent items in the rdesc.

Room descriptions should not have players @bdo@n anything.  This rule can
be violated in extreme cases (perhaps sensing some trepidation entering a
cavern full of bones) but generally you should never write "You feel
happy as you walk through the beautiful woos." Why?  Have the real
person, in real life, become happy from your prose; show them that their
character should be happy, and they will be, tell them to be happy and
the rdesc rings false and sounds awkward and canned.  Similarly, rdescs
describe - having a player *do* anything in one is no good.  This is
where actions come in; use them.  If you don't know how to code
something, ask for help.

@bCover the basics@n.  Always remember that your first job is to give the
player a handle of his or her situation and his/her immediate
surroundings.  Where is the player?  What does he see?  Where may he go? 
This is the job of the rdesc, first and foremost.

Any questions or suggestions for improvement on this rough, please let me
know.  Thanks.

Kiian.

.@b@CSYNTAX@n

recho <text>

@b@CDESCRIPTION@n

and mobs, though this doesn't normally affect mobs) exactly as if it were
a message from the server.

0 0 11 Recite~
.
@C@bSYNTAX@n

recite <scroll_name> <target> 

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

@ISome spells are written down on scrolls, and to access those spells,
one must recite the scroll.  Not all scrolls have targets; reciting a
scroll of magic mapping does not requre a target.

Note : recall scrolls have an additional, optional argument which can be
used -

recite recall <town_name> <player>

The effect is having the player recalled to the specific town; no town
name is required, though, and in that case, the default town will be the
town of that player's race.

0 0 10 Relations~
.The political relations between and among clans here are volatile and

toward members of others. For example, Khedrun and Eleint are inclined to

0 0 7 Religions~
.*** UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***
  
@I Religion is the main social and political force of this world.  The
religions are based on the various gods in existance.  There are two
classes of conflict in our world: the struggle between @border@n and
@bchaos@n, and the struggle between @bgood@n and @bevil@n.  Not all
deities involve themselves in any one of these struggles, but most
concern at least one.  Some gods are only concerned with their own greed
for power, others strive for a balance in the grand conflicts.
 
The most powerful god is @EAlgesa@n, goddess of lawfulness.  Opposing her
is @EUlthi@n, god of chaos.

There is a second tier of gods whose power is not so broad as either
Ulthi or Algesa, but nonetheless have great power.

@ETaranth@n, goddess of charity.
@EKerog@n, god of fury.
@EMeriada@n, god of time and knowledge.
@EMorkith@n, god of the undead and demons.
@EFreylia@n, Halfling goddess of festivals and battle.

There also is a third tier of gods whose influence is
weak beyond their regions of control.

@ECynnis@n, goddess of the forest.
@EKantos@n, god of mountains and earth.
@EOsse@n, god of sea.

@I Outside the pale of these stands @EMorr@n, lord of death.  There is some
debate among scholars of the realm as to whether or not @EMorr@n is
really a god as he never recognizes his followers in life.  But his power
is great over the realm of the dead and so there are many who worship him.

@I In addition to these fairly encompassing deities, there are myriad
smaller ones, from half-demons worshipped by remote orc tribes, to the
elven goddess Dawnstar.  Other than Dawnstar, a few other lesser deities
of note: Lonil, god of valor; Slen, god of luck; Anor, goddess of love.
  
@I A few other deities of note: Orlumbin, Durgoroth.

0 0 1 Remove curse~
.This spell will destroy cursed (non-removable) objects on the target's
person.  Those who are but initiates in the spell find a single curse
almost more than they can handle while the well-practiced can easily
handle two curses at once.  Only those who have truly mastered the spell
can bring the focus of their deity's power upon more than two curses at
once.

0 0 19 renegade dwarves~
.Spelunkers have reported seeing the furtive movements of diminutive
figures in the cave-riddled cliffs north of Chiiron.  The description of
the beings seen in the caves matches the description of a band of dwarves
cast out from their clans in the mountains of the north.  Adventuring
souls exploring the region claim that the dwarves have already dug in,
and are well prepared for any attacks.  There seems to be only one real
entrance into the caves they have claimed as their own, and it seems to
be guarded at all times.  Adventurers are advised to use caution when
approaching the aggressive outcasts.

0 0 19 Renegade Gnome Lair~
.The long-suffering citizens of Pennan have been weary of raids and
surprise attacks from ferocious invaders for many years.  Among the worst
culprits are a wild bunch of renegade gnomes.  These rogues and
cutthroats are skilled and dangerous, combining stealth, spellcraft, and
special equipment.  Rumors have been circulating that their secret lair
exists somewhere north of Pennan.  Those who wish to help rid Pennan of
these vile scoundrels had best be fully alert, for these gnomes are
well-trained in battle and dirty fighting tactics.

0 0 8 Rent~
.There is no @brent@n at the Forest's Edge.

You do not need to go to an inn to quit, or to continue playing to earn
money so you may safely rent.  Instead, merely use the @bQuit@n command. 
You may quit wherever you may wish, with a few restrictions (ie not while
during fighting, or in a town where you are wanted), and when you do so
your position is saved.  Any pets which you may have are saved where they
may be, your items, whether carried by you, in the bank, or on your pets,
are also saved, and all of your mail is likewise kept.

A word of caution - consider well where you quit, and are usually safe. 
A wandering aggressive mob might be waiting for you when you return if
you choose a dangerous spot.  Towns are popular places to quit, and are
usually safe.

@Grepair@n <object>   : has the shopkeeper repair the object

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

@I At the moment, the repair function is incomplete.  Eventually, players
will be able to preview the cost of the repair, and not all stores will
repair the weapon to perfect condition.

@I The cost of a repair depends upon several factors: the skill of the
shop performing the repair, the value of the item being repaired, the
complexity or rarity of such an item, and the condition of the item.

The abbreviations listed under condition are described below:

wls = worthless
dmg = damaged
vwn = very worn
wrn = worn
vsc = very scratch
scr = scratched
rea = reasonable
goo = good
vgo = very good
exc = excellent
~

.@C@bIMMORTAL NOTES@n

@I Objects have repair numbers which determine which shops can repair
them.  The higher the repair level the harder the item is to repair, 10
is impossible, 9 would only be by the greatest of craftsmen and 0-2 imply
a player with the appropriate skill (being worked on) can repair the item. 
To set a repair level on an item use oset repair while to set it on a
shop the command is shedit repair.  You should keep in mind that the
level should be for that type of item.  So a wooden artifact might be 9
even though it is much less difficult to repair than a magical sword of
the same repair level.

.A spell of no insignificant power, replicate allows the mage to harness
the mystical elements of the world to create an exact duplicate of a
specific item in his or her possession.  Through great effort and
concentration, the mage is able to bring forth matter where previously
there was none, and to bend unseen forces to his will.  The item copied
needs to be of a simple, nonmagical nature, and failure is always
possible.  A utility spell for experienced magi.

0 0 1 Request Ally~
.Through the ages, a mage has found his or her familiar to be more than
just a useful companion.  Often a mage's familiar has become an extension
of the mage.  Yet, limited by their small size, most were viewed as
nothing more than trained pets.  Such is no longer the case.  An
archmage, by tapping into planer magics, has been able to come up with a
spell designed to summon powerful allies that are more than just mere
familiars.  In order for this spell to be successful, it must be cast on
an item likely to have some special meaning or semblance to the desired
ally being requested.

These allies are said to aid only those of similar alignments.  Rumors
speak of the following allies having previously been summoned: 

        Good                   Neutral                   Evil

Allowed Fields = { 1_chance, 2_chance, 3_chance, rust, vnum, position,
liquid } 

@eDESCRIPTION@n

The resets have 3 chance fields.  When an area or mob is being reset, 3
dice are thrown.  If the first chance is accepted it checks on the second
and the same for the third.  If a chance is 0% it passes if the previous
roll passed.  A dice is rerolled whenever the reroll flag for that column
is set.  This is indicated by a * in the Rrl column.  The reroll flags
are set using a 1, 2 or 3 for the flag.

( The following is a brief explaination of how resets work.  Every reset
has a mob/object identifier, 3 chances and a set of flags associated with
it.  When an area resets, all rooms without players in it are cleared of
all objects except mob/player corpses.  The mud then runs through the
resets for the room.  Each reset has 3 "chances".  These are the numbers
switch for each chance saying whether the roll for this chance should be
rerolled when this reset is hit.
This implies that the first reset should have all 3 reroll stars set.)_

Object Flags:
  C)ontainer - Object is flaged as a container
  I)nside - Object goes in last object loaded with C flag set.

Mob Flags:
  L)eader - Mob is set as a leader
  F)ollower - Mob follows last mob loaded with L flag set.
  S)entinel - Mob is sentinel, this over-rides the species flag.
  A)ggressive - Mob attacks characters with no provocation.

.This may seem like a strange catagory to have on a mud, but in dealing

Realize that the immortals on the mud are donating their time and effort
to improve this mud.  And with the number of complaints, requests for
help that any immortal gets it is difficult not to become abrupt and
ignore many of them.

* You should always know which immortal you are dealing with.  An
immortal should not punish someone without going visible for at least a
brief instance.

* Immortals should not switch to mobs in an attempt to kill a player or
harass them.  Switching to a mob to amuse/confuse anmortal is fine, but
should be done in the spirit of fun.  If a player has found a bug to kill
a mob which they should not be able to kill, switching to the mob and
killing the player is not an acceptable solution.  Asking the player to
stay away from the mob and then fixing it is recommended.

* Email Addresses - entering this catagory is optional.  We request that
you do so but no immortal should "require" you to enter one.

.  Role playing(@bRP@n) is when you act like your character you are
playing.  For example, if you play a troll warrior you act like a dumb
troll, you talk like one, fight like one, and do everything like one.  Or
if you are a rich noble you act like a snobby rich bastard, if you are
one.  RPing makes the game take on a whole new dimension you are no
longer just hacking and slashing you are truely living the game and it's
far more enjoyable than just hack'n slash.
.  To RP though you need to have a background for your character and a
detailed @h@CDESCRIPTION@n.  This will allow you to play a consistant
character and not confuse everyone.  Its a little tough in the beginning
as you round off the ruff edges, but once you get it going, you'll love
it.  Also, keep in mind, there is a difference between being a jerk, and
playing an evil character.

0 0 1 Sanctify~
.Sanctify is used to imbue a weapon or armor with the power of a deity. 
The effect is to cause the object to degrade more slowly - it
approximately doubles its lifetime.  The level of the caster determines
how good of a weapon or armor he/she can sanctify.  The scrolls of
sanctify are of fairly low level and are thus unable to sanctify the
better weapon or armors.

they perceive to be of importance to them, thus providing some

.Many ages ago, the Sea of Stars was a watery hunting field for a ruthless
crew of pirates.  Led by their foul-mouthed captain, the pirates would
terrorize passing merchant ships and loot whatever they could come across. 
Little is known about what has become of them.  Some say they drowned in
the ocean one day due to their greed -- their ship being unable to carry
so much loot.  Others say that their ship is buried deep beneath the
southwestern part of the Sea of Stars, while their decayed bodies still
haunt the area.

0 0 19 Sea Sprite Colony~
.@IAs a fisherman from Chiiron trooped down to the beach one fine morning,
he found a very peculiar prize.  A tiny sprite, no more than two feet
tall, with bluish skin and bright green hair was caught in a long tangle
of fishing line, and a hook was imbedded in one of her little arms.  The
kind fisherman bent down to untangle the sobbing little creature and took
her to the temple of Taranth for healing.
@IThe wise priestess of Taranth healed the sprite's wounds and comforted
her.  The little elf-like sprite told how she had become lost in the
darkness while hunting for her missing school of angel fish.  After being
caught in a strong current, she ended up tangled in the fishing twine and
the hook had become lodged in her arm.
@ITo get her back to her colony, the priestess took the sprite to the
beach near Chiiron and pointed her in a south-westerly direction.  As the
sprite disappeared beneath the waves, her green hair was still visible and
the priestess could see her head south-west toward the barrier reef of the
Sea of Stars.

trap will only work if you are a Thief, Ranger, or Bard.  And the ease of
finding said trap is descending in that order.  So Thieves are the best
at finding them.  They are also the ONLY class that gains the ability to

.Resting above a cliff near the beach close to Chiiron is a large shadowy
forest that overlooks the expansive Sea of Stars.  This vast forest was
once home to several forest gnomes who enjoyed a peaceful trade with the
neighboring sea sprites and humans of Chiiron.  Several years ago,
though, the gnomes were seen fleeing the forest, battered and bloodied by
a large battle with a clan of evil dark faeries.  These faeries claimed
the forest their own as part of their new kingdom.  Upon finding out
about the neighboring sea sprites, the faeries quickly began building an
army because, in their eyes, these sprites were nothing more than a
nuisance.  Soon began the great faerie/sprite war which has raged for
several years now.  The faeries view all other races as weak and
insignificant and do not hesitate to attack any intruders in their forest.

The keep itself was ripped from its true home centuries ago and placed
here by the beast, and now is inhabited by strange goblins with white
skin, as large as men.  The road to the keep is long and treacherous, as
the legendary yeti await the unwary trespasser, and tales of giant,
flesh-devouring worms which burrow in the snow abound from the few
adventurers who return from a journey to the keep.  Fragile ice bridges
and caves inhabited by fearsome, giant bats abound, and the snow is
endless.  Let adventurers beware the wrath of the creatures which make
their fell homes near the Shattered Keep in the Dragonspires.

@Gshflag@n <flag>     : changes the object types which the shop buys
@Gshedit@n new        : creates a new shop, note no mob reference
@Gshedit@n keep <mob> : sets the shopp keeper of the new shop to <mob>
@Gshedit@n repair #   : sets the repair level of the shop
    
@CDESCRIPTION@n
    
This is used to set up a mob as a shop and set the types of things that
the mob will buy.  To 'build' a shop follow these steps.  
  
1.  mload the mob you want to be the shopkeeper.  A mob doesn't have to
    be a completely new type of mob - it can be one already used as a 
    shop-keeper.
2. reset mob  - to make it keep comming back 
3. shed new   - creates the shop
4. shed keep <mob>    - sets the shop keeper to the mob
5.  set the types of items for the shopkeeper to sell/buy: shed <flag>
    for each item type.
7. reset the items in the room: reset <item>
   Make sure you use @breset@n and not @bmreset@n.
And make sure you set the item's position to inventory 'reset # posi inv'.
8.  if you want the shopkeeper to be able to repair items: shed repair
<level> - where <level> is a number 1 to 10(10 being the most skill) 
  
Mobs gain and lose items as follows. Each reset every item that the mob
curently holds has a 10% chance of being removed.  So if a mob has 10
bells and 10 whistles chances are it will lose two items though it
doesn't have to, and they don't have to be one bell and one whistle. 
Every reset the mob will go through its mreset list and add an item if
the right 'roll' comes up.  So on average if you give a mob a 800 (mill)
chance of gaining an item it will roughly have 7 to 9 items at any one
time.  Note you can make a mob hold more than 10 (roughly) items by
giving it more than one 1000 (mill) reset.  

9.  Pet shops: Set rflag pet_shop.  Add shopkeeper as normal.  Reset pets
to be sold (must have a price AND must be tameable) in the room that is
ONE higher up from the shop keeper.  (Meaning that if your shop keeper is
in room 386, a "pen" or holding area for pet resets must be in room 387.

everything from armor to magical regeants.  While in a shop, typing
@Clist@n will display a table of what is for sale, and their prices as
well as minimum level and condition.  Most of the time, you can @Cbuy@n
items from the store by typing @Cbuy@n <object>, assuming you have enough
money to pay for it.  If you want to sell an item, the @Cvalue@n command
has the shopkeeper appraise the object, and then tell you how much he
will pay for it, and the cost to @Crepair@n it if it is damaged.  Then,
you can sell the item from your inventory by typing @Csell@n <object>.

@I Sometimes, shopkeepers have the ability to make rare, special, often
magical items, given the correct ingredients.  By typing @Ccustom@n, you
can see if a shopkeeper produces any special item.  Once you have
collected all the necessary ingredients and can pay forthe item, then you
can purchase it by typing @Ccustom@n <object>.

@I Although the primary function of the shopkeepers is to maintain their
business, often they act as trainers as well.  They can teach you skills

Here are the basic steps to writing a social:

I.  Type 'tedit new <social table name> <social name>'
     Example:  tedit new soc.elf laugh
II.  Type 'tset <social field> <social entry>'
      Example:  tset ch.self You laugh quietly at what $N did.
      Example:  tset position resting
NOTE: Typing tstat will keep you updated on the various entries of the
current social that you are editting.
Typing just tset position, tset aggressive, tset disrupt, or tset reveal
will show the various possible entries for those social fields.  Also,
read help @mvariables@n for the particular variable to use and help
@gsocial fields@n for a description of what each field does or shows.

III.  Continue to add as many entries to the social table as you can
think up.
IV.  When you are done with all the entries to the socials, type 'tedit
sort <social table name>' which is important for the social to take
effect.
V.  Type 'write tables' to save the social to disk in case the mud crashes
or something else unexpected occurs.

Feel free to look at other examples of socials for hints, ideas, or more
help by typing 'tedit <social table name> <social name>' and then typing
'tstat'.

Furthermore, please avoid writing socials that are considered too
obscene, such as 'fart', 'pee', etc.

.
Please type "socials" for a listing of all socials available.  In
addition to generic socials, each race has its own list of socials that
are distinct.  In order to get a list of racial socials, please type
"social <race>." Typing social lizardman, for example, will show you a
list of lizardman socials.

.@bImmortal Notes@n

@I Socials can be editted via tedit socials.  If a message is prefixed by
! that indicates the social can be "seen" by someone who is blind. 
Please do not add offensive socials such as spit, fart, grope as the
players do not need encouragement to be annoying.

 help armor_effects  ----- effects attributable to armor wear locations.
 help object_affects ----- level-to-affect guidelines

                   (alternatively oload 1517)
 help costs ----- just what it sounds like
 help durabilities ----- base durabilties for object types

@CWhat follows are files that are not necessarily correct.@n These are
just the files I was able to find and collate into an organized list. 
Hopefully we will be able to weed out the useless ones and form a set of
standards that we will all conform to for the sake of consistency.

Since the "standards" are already spread over several different help
files, this should be used to direct imms to the appropriate help files. 
   
(outdated) help a s  ----- an armor standards help file.
(outdated) help armor system  ----- standards for armor type base ac.
(outdated) help weapon_damage  -- weapon damage / level mininum for use.
help objects  ----- object modifiers (ie what size shields should affect dex)
                         (not to be confused with help object (#405) ).
(outdated) help items  ----- modifiers to item min level by specials. <<see help object_affects>>
help class damage  ----- damage done by character class.
help class_standards  ----- another damage done by class file.
help monk  ----- a standards for monk damage / level.
help crimes  ----- how imms should deal with players breaking rules.
help guidelines  ----- general builder guideline standards.
help rdesc_standards  ----- general builder guidelines for rdescs.
help resistances  ----- resistances tables (fire, cold, etc) (incomplete).
help size flags  ----- has useful info on how to use size / race / anti flags.
help variables  ----- ok, so its not a standard, buts very useful for imms to know.
   
Things we could still use standards for:
move points, damage for mobs when disarmed.

about them; what they look like and how they act are good starters.(See
@b@Whelp description@n for how to write your description.) 
@B2.@nExplore your starting town, look for shopkeepers and trainers. 
    @b@RAttacking members of your clan will get you kicked out of your clan

0 0 0 Station~
.A proposed new statistic for players which would be randomly determined
during character creation.  The number would range from 0-10 and reflect
a character's social status within his clan.  (Outsiders can be assumed
to react to all Eleint, for example, in a similar way, being unaware of
the subtle differences among members of a single clan).

Would be useful to determine how NPCs react to characters, help players
role-play their character's background, and to a lesser extent 

@bRough list of values:@n
10 - Bluest of blue bloods, Over-kings, Emperors
9 - Royalty
8 - Major Nobility
7 - Minor/Petty Nobility, Knights etc.
6 - Commercial interests, influential non-nobles
5 - Upper classes etc
4 - Merchants, bougeois, shopkeepers, etc
3 - Lower middling classes
2 - The poor, marginalized classes
1 - Untouchables, scorned castes
0 - { See below }

The vast majority of players would have stations ranging from 2-4 (a
reflection of society).  Monks, whose vows place them outside the reach
of such temporal concerns, would automatically have a status of 0 (null).

0 0 21 Strongholds~
.@IDue to recent negotiations with the Dwarven Labour Union, a new
pricelist has been compiled for the building of Clan Strongholds.

@b*@nThe basic clan stronghold has been adjusted to three rooms, your clan
insignia, and a clan bank account (forthcoming).  Flat rate for this is
350k.

@b*@nA basic locked door and key comes complimentary with your clan house. 
However for those of you who would like a little more secrecy, you can
add a secret entrance to your clan house.  The price of this added
feature will be between @b15k@n and @b50k@n depending on how elaborate
you want to get.

@b*@nFor those of you who would like a @bfountain@n built in
your Stronghold, the charge is @b50k@n for materials and labour.

@b*@nExtra room descriptions, such as pictures on the wall you can look
at, will cost you @b10k@n per description.

@b*@nExtra rooms leading up to a Stronghold will be priced at @b25k@n
for the first two rooms, then @b100k@n for each room after that.

@b*@nA bottomless kettle of soup in your stronghold will be @b30k@n for
stocking, labour, having the kettle fashioned, etc.

@b*@nActions, such as 'You smell a delicious aroma waft up from the kettle
of soup,' will cost @b15k@n per action.

@b*@nSecret rooms will not be part of the basic three rooms.  To
create a secret room, you will be charged @b100k@n for an extra room as
well as an additional @b50k@n for the concealment of the door and hidden
lever.

@b*@nWhen youre relaxing in your new Stronghold or having an important
meeting, you may want to have a few tables, chairs or couches for you and
your guests.  The price for a basic piece of furniture will be @b5k@n, but
if you want some exotic custom item, its going to be charged at a custom
price.  (Such as a throne or a dragon leather couch.)

@e*@nStorage rooms are available for your stronghold at the cost of
@e200k@n for the flag, with an additional purchase cost of 100k for the
room itself.  These rooms save over crashes/reboots, and do not reset. 
Items will stay indefinitely either on the ground or in chests, should
you choose to purchase them.

If there is something you would like for your clan house that is not
listed here, please ask about it and it can be submitted to the Union for
consideration.  However, Dwarves being the practical creatures they are,
try to keep it within the boundaries of realism.

switch <familiar> : switch into your familiar's body

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Switch is the command used by mages to operate their familiars.  While in
their familiars bodies, mages will 'see' things from the familiar's
viewpoint, and will or will not have infravision, detect hidden, etc. 
according to the familiar's senses.  To return from a familiar to one's
body, the command is, logically enough, @breturn@n.

0 0 8 Syntax~
.@I This mud expects a syntax of input slightly different than most muds,
which can be confusing at first.  There are special characters that must
be used in conjunction with certain commands to either distinguish
between items with similar names, or do an action to multiple items.
@I There are many objects in the mud that have almost identical names. 
For example, if you have a short sword and a long sword in your
inventory, typing 'look sword' might not look at the correct sword.  To
look specifically at the long sword, you would put a period in between
the words of the object's name.  So, 'look long.sword' would look at the
long sword.  If you wanted to @Ebuy@n a soft leather jacket and not a hard
leather jacket, you would type 'buy soft.leather.jacket'.
@I Often, you will want to do something with many of the same type of
item.  To get, give, drop, @Esell@n, or @Ebuy@n many of the same type of
item, you would use the '*' character in front of the object's name, in
the form x*<object>, x being the number of that object.  For example, to
drop 10 copper pieces, you would type 'drop 10*copper'.  To buy 3 wooden
shields, you would type 'buy 3*wooden.shield'.
@I The prefix 'all' is also used.  To sell all the skins in your
inventory, you would type 'sell all.skin'.  HOWEVER, 'all' can be used in
two ways.  To get all the objects from your bag, you would type 'get all
bag'.  But, to get all the bags in the room, you would type 'get all.bag'.

0 0 19 talonwood~
.Long ago the Llewyrr of the Vaasa took pity on a band of goblinoids less
evolved than their cousins and harboured them deep in the Vaasa. 
Unfortunately for the elves, the goblinoids learned all too quickly that
they enjoyed the taste of elves and had a curious penchant for
destruction.  Although the elves tried many times to usher the goblins
from the forest and even resulted to violence to kill them off, they
never quite managed to rid themselves of these pests, now called the
tasloi.  Just when it seemed they were gone for good, they would seem to
have a population exposion and things would start all over.
  
Things had been quite for a while, however, it seems the tasloi are back. 
A few battered and bruised travellers have reported losing whole groups
to strange beasts hidden in the mists of the malformed talonwood forest
southeast of the Vaasa.  Among the strange beasts, travellers have given
descriptions of little goblinoid creatures that perfectly match the
description of the tasloi.  Be careful, as they seem to have learned the
benefit of ambushes now and are becoming quite proficient at taking down
unwary travellers.
   
Most sages agree, the talonwood is not a safe place for the more fragile
folk.  They recomend you be at least level 15 before you try to survive a
jaunt through the misty woods.

0 0 19 talonwood~
.Long ago the Llewyrr of the Vaasa came upon a lesser developed tribe of
goblinoids.  The tribe of goblinoids were very primitive and were
persecuted, even by other goblins.  The Llewyrr took pity on them and
gave them refuge in the vastness of the Vaasa.  The Llewyrr called them
tasloi, an ancient elven word meaning "wood goblin", and began to teach
them how to survive in the woods.
   
Things went well for a few brief years, then the tasloi turned on the
Llewyrr.  What started as spiteful pranks by the tasloi grew until it
came to all out war.  In the end, the Llewyrr hunted down most of the
tasloi and managed to chase the rest out of the Vaasa.  Enough of the
tasloi survived to form small bands, and every few decades a population
explosion seems to occur and the Llewyrr are plagued by tasloi hungry for
elf flesh.  Recently they tasloi seem to have learned to hide from even
the vigilant Llewyrr scouts and rangers and have taken to using ambush
tactics.  This time, they have made it further back into the Vaasa then
ever before and the Llewyrr are becoming concerned.
  
The tasloi live primarily in the Talonwood to the southeast of the Vaasa. 
Both the tasloi and many of the other denizens of the Talonwood are quite
dangerous.  Most scribes agree you should not attempt to enter before
level 15, the ones that didn't agree thought you should wait even longer,
but who ever listens to scribes these days.

0 0 1 Tame~
.Tame is a ranger spell allowing the caster to tame a wild animal.  A tame
animal will become the pet of the caster.  The profiency of the caster
determines chance of success.  Also only certain types of monsters can be
tamed.  A frog, skeleton or insect is impossible to tame, but a rabbit or
bear or other animal is possible.

You can only tame a number of animals whose total levels are less than or
equal to your level of experience.

Remember, implicit in the tame spell is the idea that the ranger is, in a
sense, befriending the creature.  Rangers cannot, nor would they, gain
the trust of a creature only to betray it, sell it, or otherwise abuse
the spirit of such a creature.

Remeber, also, that not all pets are welcome in all towns.  Some citizens
of certain towns loathe certain animals and will attack them on sight.

disiplines in need more than any other goddess.  The disadvantages are
being unable to wear anything made of gold or silver, and due to the vows
of poverity storing money in a bank is unallowed.  The main temple to

0 0 19 The Black Wastes~
.Legends tell of a great land known as Tarik Nor and until recently they
were just rumors until a band of adventurers found a barren tunnel
leading to a desert terrain which they believe is Tarik Nor.  The land is
described as a vast wasteland, completely void of all wildlife, plants
and water, being nothing more then a flat desert.  Reports from several
other bands of adventurers tell of a forest which lies deep inside the
waste but further exploration was blocked as unseen forces seemed to push
them away.  Scholars and sages have researched the land deeply and have
found that it was once part of a major trade route that linked Pennan,
Medienne and Chiiron with exotic supplies and crafts.  The last
expedition to travel into the wastes was never heard from again.  What
truly lies inside the land of Tarik Nor is unknown but legends speak of a
marvelous city from which riches of unbelievable magnitude were bought
and sold daily.  Those wishing to travel into the land are told to seek
the north-eastern most section of the Dragonspire mountain range but many
sages warn that the path is dangerous and death lurks around every corner
in this forbidden land.

received from the scouting party: 
    
Day 1
We have found an entrance into the strange clearing yesterday and have
spent the night just inside the vast opening.  We will rest for the night
after an altercation with a strange group of frog men.  We plan on
sending a small group deeper in tomorrow.  If this group is successful we
will map the area and continue on to Sos-Kul.
     
Day 2
The small party we sent into the clearing has not returned.  The clearing
is completely free from the elements.  The canopy that covers it provides
us shelter from the brutal weather of the swamp.  We plan on going in
after the initial party this afternoon and then continue on to Sos-Kul.

their home around the area.

The Woodworms (level 8-20)
  
The woodworms are a well-known and much feared menace of the Vaasa. 
Their depredations are responsible for the death of several venerable
shuvana trees.  Though feared for the swathe of destruction they can
cause, slowly devouring tree after tree, many elves have taken it upon
themselves to champion the cause of the woodworm's downfall.  With
vigilance and constant hard work, the elves have managed to keep the
depredations of the woodworms at a standstill.  Should you seek to join
these noble guardians of the woods in defending the Vaasa, then ask any

0 0 8 tips~
.TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to The Forest's Edge
get their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you
start your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!
@I
@I Law 1: Self-Preservation.  Set your @bwimpy@n.  What "wimpy" does is
engage character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of
course) is beaten down to 8 hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't
simply rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  @bFlee@ning (typing
"flee") will also get you to protect your tender hide.
@I
@I Law 2: Con before kill.  Before you even *think* about attacking a
mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To do this type "con
monster_name" -- perhaps "con goat" -- and hit enter.  This will make
your character "consider" his/her chance of success against that monster
in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you come accross, type "kill
monster_name." 
@I
@I Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were
feeling hungry or thirsty.  Here at TFE you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers
and brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food
can be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type "eat bread" or "drink fountain" to eat and drink.
@I
@I Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type "skin corpse"
after the fight has ended.
@I
@I Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
at TFE, you need to @bpractice@n and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you
much good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters)
have been around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type "prac" in
a room where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught
there, a list of skills will appear.  Type "prac skill_name" to train in
that skill.  Type "abil" to see a list of your abilites which can be
learned.
@I
@I
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Happy MUDding!!

0 0 19 tomb of harand-da~
.In an age long forgotten, hordes of orcs roamed the great fields of the
west, where now small human villages have come to flourish.  The orcs
pillaged where they pleased, took what they wished, and grew strong and
powerful as the elves roamed their forests far to the east, and the
dwarves lay resting in the cold stone mountains of the north.  But the
orcs grew restless, and came together in a great army intent on
overthrowing the dwarven fortresses of the Cairn Mountains, even unto
Kha-Da itself.  Harand-Da the One-Handed, a mighty hero of the dwarves of
the line of Khedrus, First King and founder of the Khedrun clan, rallied
his dwarven clansmen and met this great dark horde in the fields just
west of the Bridge of Tears.  The battle was long, and bloody, and many
pages are filled with tales and songs of the heros and villains who made
their names with axe, hammer, and scimitar.  Finally the orcs made a
final charge, breaking the ranks of the seasoned dwarves and smashing the
armies of Harand-Da against the stones.  But Harand-Da would not
surrender.  He too led a final charge, rallying the scattered dwarves and
meeting the orc advance upon the Bridge of Tears itself.  The charge
destroyed the orcs utterly, sending the few survivors that could run
fleeing back across the great fields of the west and into the deserts and
barrens beyond.  But the day was not without its losses.  Scores and
scores of dwarves, both old and young, fell in the victory.  Harand-Da
himself took an orc spear in the heart as he stepped over a clansman who
had fallen.
Harand-Da was laid to rest in a place of honor in the heart of the Cairn
Mountains, above the tomb of Khedrus himself.  Others who had fallen in
the battle were lain as honor guards, left to rest in peace for all
eternity.
It is said they will only awaken when the ancient evil of the lost race
of Western Orcs, the Durgoroth, returns to endanger the mighty halls of
Kha-Da once again.

it started out as a trading post Chiiron quickly grew to be a thriving
community and welcomes all light races.  Chiiron is also the starting
point for many new and brave adventurers.


@C[Medienne]@n
@W[Humans: Secomber]@N

Medienne was once a thriving merchant community until a long and deadly
war with the neighboring elves ravaged the city.  The city has slowly began
to rebuild itself to the former glory but is also in constant danger due to
the nearby forest and graveyard filled with many dangerous monsters.
Despite its hazardous locale many adventurers call Medienne home due to its
tolerance for both light and dark races.


@C[Darkhaven]@n
@W[Dark Races]@n

Darkhaven is a small underground city which is home to the evil beings of
the realms.  Many humans, vyans, ogres, trolls and the like call this city
home due to its hidden location.  No light race has ever ventured into
the city and returned to tell what lies inside it.


@C[Pennan]@n
@W[Humans: Secomber]@n

Pennan is a very large farming community a few miles west of Chiiron.  Surrounding
the city are lush, green hills which the farmers of the town allow their
herds to graze.  Pennan is under constant attack by the many monsters which live
dangerous close to its walls.  Pennan is known for their superior armorsmiths
which have setup shops and make finely crafted armors.


@C[Kha-Da]@n
@W[Dwarves: Khedrun]@n

Nestled deep inside the Cairn Mountains lies the dwarven stronghold known
as Kha-Da.  The city is home to superior dwarven armorsmiths and weaponsmiths.
A few dwarves call this city home as is it so isolated that it rarely
has any trouble from the nearby monsters.


@C[Brithbarad]@n
@W[Orcs: Azak]@n

Brithbarad is a large orcish outpost several miles north of the Black Hills.
The outpost is surrounded by grassy plain regions home to several varieties
of dangerous animals.  Many dark races as well as orcs call this home due to
the tolerance the orcs have for other races which someday may be
needed as allies.


@C[Denab-Knur]@n
@W[Ogres: Karse]@n

Located in the side of the Dragonspire Mountains, this ruined town was once
a thriving human settlement.  After several brutal battles the ogres of the
land slaughtered all the townsfolk and claimed it as their own.  Since than it
has become more decrepit and ruined.  The main home for ogres, the town also
holds a tolerance for other dark races.


@C[Vaasa]@n
@W[Elves: Eleint]@n

Little is known about this elven city for only a selected few of non-elven heritage
have ventured into it.  Those that have seen it have come back to tell about
its beautiful view overlooking the Vaasa and its marvelous construction.
Hidden among the trees only elves seem to be able to find its extremely well
hidden locale.


@C[Sos-Kul]@n
@W[Lizardmen: Stahl]@n

Most would call the Kss'sk swamp a dark, damp creation where only monsters
and leeches dwell, but to the lizardmen, the swamp is known as home.  Nestled
within the swamp is the lizardman city of Sos-Kul.  Although not as advanced
as other races, the lizardmen pride themselves upon being able to live
in such an unforgiving enivorment.  The city lies far to the south and the path
is dangerous to all but the most experienced adventurer.

1 0 8 Train~
.@IIn order to gain in proficiency in a skill, one must be trained in that
skill by the appropriate teacher.  Teachers are found, usually, in a
town, and each teacher teaches a subset of skills or spells available to
your class.  Trainers for higher level skills, generally anything above
15th level, are often located elsewhere and will usually require some
exploration and thinking to locate them.  Don't be afraid to ask NPCs
(non-player characters) about skills you want to learn.  Please note that
a teacher for a particular skill of one class may not teach that same
skill to another class, and that one can be trained in a skill only up to
level 7.  Further increases in skill level will depend upon successful
use and your characters intelligence and wisdom.

In an effort to make trainers and the skills they teach on par with the
difficulty it is to reach them, the following rules should apply toward
assigning trainers.

*City trainers should not teach skills about 15th level, (+/- 5).
*It is not necessary for trainers to teach all the prereqs along with
their skills.
*Skills above 15th level should have minimun # of trainers, in most
cases, 1 or 2.  Accessible by all.
*Low level Trainers should teach no more than 10 skills.
*Mid level Trainers should teach no more than 3-4 mid skills.
*High level Trainers should teach no more than 2-3 high skills.

no syntax, this is just an informal help file for newbie immortals :)

@CDESCRIPTION@n
  
This help file should be one of the first help files you read.  It shall
walk you through many of the immortal commands you are going to need to
get started.  You may either use this as a step-by-step program or as a
reference.  Many of the commands shall be left until later, since you
won't able to do some of them, and some will get you in trouble if used
unwisely.  My personal opinion is that a newbie immortal does not need to
know how to load or make armor/equipment/or weapons, because you DON'T
need them, and it will deter you from "cheating." Granted, you could
probably go through "comm" and "index" to determine other commands (and
you probably should), but this file is just to show you some of the basic
commands you'll need to get under your belt.  Now, let the big ol' battle
cartoon begin.

Trance, a higher level of meditate, allows monks to relax their bodies,
curing their wounds much more quickly than normal.  When a monk has
mastered meditate, and reached his 25th level, trance can be learned to
augment meditation.  It allows an even higher rate of regeneration when
one meditates.

0 0 19 troglodytes~
.Long, long ago an ancient race dwelled in the Vaasa.  What became of
them, no one is certain, but they did leave behind ancient ruins.  Recent
excavations of these ruins by the local Llewyrr have led to the discovery
of an ancient cavern inhabbited by a feral troglodytic people.  Though
the troglodytes seem to have no real tendancy towards good or evil, they
are cerainly a nuisance.  Several troglodytes have managed to make it to
the surface, only to pray upon animal and sentient being alike with a
sheer, bestial brutatilty.  If the safety of the Vaasa is to be
preserved, the noble guardians of the Vaasa will have to turn their
attentions within and prevent a full uprising of these strange creatures.
   
The few Llewyrr that have ventured into the dark, dank layers come back
with odd tales of strange sites.  After much consultation between the
noble guardians, they ventured the comment that they felt the troglodyte
menace could be controlled.  They felt the troglodytes served about the
same threat that the woodworms posed to the denizens of the forest.

0 0 19 Troll Warrens~
.Hidden away underground for many years, the cave troll clan of Nethr'arak
has long prospered in the soft limestone caves they called home.  Raids
upon the surface were not uncommon, yet they were not frequent by any
standards.

At least until recently.

Travellers from Medienne to Denab-Khur have found bloodstains upon the
Great North Road and have found some few personal effects of an ill-fated
merchant caravan.  The Watchers of Voaleth have also reported some
missing persons and scenes of combat without any bodies.

Rumors abound about a new chieftess that has given the clan a new
purpose, about a new breed of troll that breathes fire, and also that
they are taller than frost giants.

Be wary, traveller, for there are worse things in the night than
pickpockets, and yet beware of rumors that could play you false and
separate the fool from his money.

.@GAverage Statistics for Trolls@n

Height: males about 6'4" - 7'4"
        females: about 6'6" - 7'6"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to have black hair, not always on their
      head.  What hair grows on them is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls of the north have white hair, with at least
      more on their head than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.
Affiliation: trolls are a dark race.

Appearance: Trolls have green skin in a variety of hues (though none are
what would be called vibrant, verdant, bright, neon, or electric green). 
They are often warty or have cancerous appearing growths, though these do
not seem to affect their health negatively in any way, rather it appears
to be an excess product of their ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost
never have any scars, as they heal so incredibly well.  For a race that
is typically foul, corrupt and evil they have incongruous gift of
incredible regeneration but it comes at the cost of a never-ending hunger.

Ice trolls tend to have duller, paler skin that is typically dry.  Their
hair is coarse and bushy.  Swamp trolls tend to have darker shades of
skin and greasy, sparse hair.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Troll@n

Trolls are known to be big, slow lumbering behemoths whose sole goal in
life is to feed their never-ending appetite.  Fortunately for them, just
about anything short of stone is considered edible and their metabolisms
are quite happy to oblige in that regard.  While an uprooted shrub or
forgotten bit of clothing makes an adequate snack, the best food is
something you just killed yourself.  While some trolls have finally
managed to figure out that skinning an animal might provide fur you can
sell for even better tasting meat, most still prefer to just eat the
corpse outright.  After all, not much tastes better than a fresh kill
whose blood is still warm.  The fact that you just killed it yourself,
somewhat sating an almost equal appetite for destruction is just spice for
the flavoring.

Two varieties of troll have developed in the realm, though both races
share a few common characteristics.  Hunger, the ability to heal, and a
complete loathing for sunlight.  All trolls prefer the dark of a nice
cave to the painful light of day.  They also all share a deep-rooted fear
of fire as it has the ability to harm them and is about the only thing
likely to scar a troll.

Swamp trolls are the more common variety when seen at all, tending
towards solitary life.  They are fairly anti-social, even among their own
kind and like to live under the exposed roots of large swamp trees or
under bridges.  They are quick to anger, quick to kill things, and
insufferably monotonous.  They are poor conversationalists with
communication skills often extending at best to grunts and simple
gestures.

Ice trolls, also called northern trolls, are found primarily in the upper
Cairn mountains and, infrequently, in the Dragonspire mountains.  Unlike
their swampland cousins, they share a common social structure and tend to
live in small familial groups in the mountain caves.  Though they still
share a fairly low level of communication, they are at least known to
have a limited vocabulary making them seem leaps and bounds ahead of
their swampland cousins.  Ice trolls tend to be more intellectually
advanced, which still isn't saying much, heartier in survival, but
smaller, weaker and less brutal in comparison to their cousins.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Trolls are typically a solitary breed, though they rarely fight with
other trolls when they do meet.

Vyans are considered untrustworthy schemers, though useful allies in dire
circumstances.

Goblins are only useful as lackeys and servants.

Orcs make useful allies and fair-to-middling hunting partners
particularly when the quarry is elves.

Short of other trolls, ogres make the best companions as they share the
trolls' lack of love for conversation and their love of carnage.

Elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings are despised as legions of light
and order as much as their tendency to get in the way of a good meal. 
Fortunately they, themselves make excellent meals.  Provided they didn't
bring fire, one meal is as good as another.

The best thing about ents is provoking them.  After all, they look so
much like trolls that they must be related.  Trolls just can't figure out
what's wrong with them that they serve light and goodness.  As they are
typically slow to anger, trolls get great mirth out of trying to convert
ents.  A lack of vocabulary simply means this usually take the form of
offering ents ample bloody meals, which they invariable refuse.  The look
of tormented sadness in their eyes as they consider the harm you caused
to living beings in obtaining the meat is about as much fun to see as it
is getting the meat in the first place.

The best thing about humans is the fact that they keep building bridge to
hide under and most of them are too weak to harm a troll.  The end result
is that they build trolls fabulous homes then pay them to walk over them
and if they refuse to pay they try to cross anyway making a never-ending
supply of meals that come to your very own front door.  The occasional
human turns to the dark side and makes for an interesting hunting
companion as they can be quite inventive in their destructiveness.

@eDESCRIPTION@n

This command is used to link a message to a specific room and is used for

It can only be seen while in the room you post the message and only by
immortals, so it is of no use if you post it ten rooms after you notice
the mistake or if you notice a mistake on a wandering creature.

In the case of rooms in out of the way places, where an immortals is
unlikely to visit, and thus correct, any time soon or in the case of
mobile creatures and items it is best to post a note on the @bbugs@n
board.  If you do not know about the bugs board check under @bhelp
@bnoteboard@n.  If it is a note related to a specific room, its a good idea
to still post a typo message as there are often a score of rooms with the
same or similar names and the typo posting will let us know exactly when
we hit the room you mentioned.  (Of course, also take into consideration,
is it imperative that we have to correct this right away before you post

travels the earth starting conflicts and destroying lives.

@I Very few humans, elves or dwarves follow Ulthi, but he has a
significant following among the trolls, orcs and goblins of the realm. 
Only evil characters can follow Ulthi, though there is no restriction on
race, class or level.  Ulthi grants his follower no powers and rarely
comes to their aid.  It is rumored he does not have many of the powers of
the other gods.

@I In balance though, he places no restrictions on his followers 
and even encourages them to wreak what havoc they can.

Has eyes off - can't blind undead, Mind resistance set to 100%.  Zero
regen on for lower level undead mobs, on (allows players the chance to
reraise undead by investing more energy in trade for the fact that undead
don't heal), wimpy off (they don't fear damage, won't flee).  include
Undead in keywords.  Marmor should be according to logic.
  
@CZombies@n:  fill zombie slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)
          fill skeleton slot with a skeleton (you can always rot the flesh off)
For zombies attached to mobs, set their level = 1/2 donor mob, however,
set the stas of said zombie to those of a mob = 1/3 the donor mob.
Set to slow (unless donor mob was fast), has_eyes on (they have them),
Infravision on (low_level sense life).  They are the lowest level of
undead and not immune to much, so low level fire / cold resist, slightly
better electrical resist.
     Damage done by zombie should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob.  (If donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to
less damage or maybe just two claw attacks, etc.  Use your best judgment).
Often it is easiest to start by just dropping any special attack the
donor mob had.
   
@CSkeletons@n:  dont fill zombie slot, no flesh/muscle parts left.
            fill skeleton slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)
For skeletons attached to mobs, level = level of donor mob, however, the
stats of said skeleton should = 2/3 stats of the donor mob.
don't set to fast unless donor mob was fast to begin with.  Has_eyes off,
Infravision / See_invisible on (effectively sense life).  Slightly better
defense of fire/cold/elec then similar zombie type.
     Damage done by skeleton should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob. (If the donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to
less damage or maybe just two claw atttacks, etc.  Use your best judgement).
Those with immaterial or ethereal forms (ghosts, banshees, etc)
should have the mflag ghost and mflag no_bash set.

.The ruler of Voaleth lives in this grand palace just past the southern

find some of these ancient escape routes with diligent searching.

@IIn an old, abandoned mine shaft near Voaleth, explorers have found a
cavern with a huge door set into the north wall.  Finely wrought of
mithril and steel, the door was unable to be opened.  Upon hearing of
this find, Tsarith, Master Sage of Voaleth, sent word to Etrahnin of
Pennan.  A codex Tsarith had translated only days before told of an
entombed force of guards protecting the tomb of their nobles.  Perhaps
this door is the entrance to the tomb... Only the Sages know what lies

0 0 10 Vyans~
.@GAverage Statistics for Vyans@n (aka Dark Elves)

Height: males about 4'8" - 5'8"
        females about 4'6" - 5'6"

Hair: typically straight.  Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      Extremely rarely brown or blond.  Vyans have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Other colors, such as brilliant blues or
      anything from gray to black are also not uncommon.

Affiliation: vyans are a dark race.

Appearance: Vyans look much like humans though they generlaly have a
smaller, slenderer build than humans.  Vyans tend to have smooth
unblemished skin ranging from midnight black to pale, wan colors and
ashen castes.  The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is
almost completely unheard of.  Despite their apperance as a result of
living primarily underground for countless centuries, vyans tend to
possess a beauty to equal that of elves.  There dark beauty has drawn in
many an unwary victim who later fell pray to whatever schemes the vyans
were planning.  You probably won't see wrinkles on a vyan before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hrd to notice for a few hundred more years.  Vyan hair
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.
Like elves, vyans have upswept, pointed ears.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Vyan@n

Vyans are a haughty race, indeed perhaps the most haughty of all races. 
They will refer to themselves as vyans or simple The People, as they view
any other race as chattel to be used or destroyed at a whim and with no
more remorse than if they were objects.  They believe it is their
divinely given right to rule and they very nearly manage to succeed.

If playing a normal vyan, it might be suggested that you imply that you,
or another vyan, is the undisputed leader of any group you are in.  If
anyone disputes this you should probably follow them into the nearest
playerkilling zone and kill them or have a loyal minion kill them in your
name.  After all, it is divine will that ordains your rulership.  Just
don't confuse leadership with tanking (being the one who takes all the
hits in a group).  That's what sturdy minions are for, preferably ogres
and trolls, who are just big dumb brutes adapted to taking such beatings.

Vyans hate to be called dark elves.  Once, long ago the elves and the
vyans may have shared common ancestors, but the elves have proven to be
weak fool relying on the good will of life where they should accept their
role as an elder race along with the vyans and rule through power.  Long
wars have developed due to the rift in elven and vyan philosophies and
there is no hope of a peace ever developing now.  To call a vyan an elf,
even a dark elf, is to imply that they are weak and foolish.  Ideally
only other vyans should be permited to even speak to you, however, on
those occasions when a minion must speak with you they should refer to
you as master.


@yRacial Relations:@n
As the only true people, vyans view every other race with some measure of
contempt, though some more than others.

Trolls, Ogres and Orcs make good minions and cannon fodder in a fight.

Goblins are a nuisance best destroyed unless you have raised them from
birth to be subserviant slaves.

Humans, while occasionally producing a few dark-minded folk who can serve
as good as ogres, trolls and orcs, are primarily still pretty useless and
are better destroyed than ignored before they get lucky and find some way
to cause trouble.

Dwarves, halflings, and gnomes typically serve the force of light and
should be destroyed outright as they are meddlesome nuisances.

Elves have become the bane of vyan existence.  These close cousins embody
all the week, pathetic ideas that the vyan nation finally overcame and
cast off.  An unending war has raged for countless centuries between
these two races that emobody the paths of light and dark.

Ents, as servants of the light and close allies of elves are hated, but
only about as much as one could be said to hate a dangerous animal.  They
are dangerous, but they aren't really people.  If not for the fact they
aid the elves much in the same way ogres and trolls are of use to the
vyans, ents would be a concern that could be left off for a later, more
convenient date.

0 0 20 walkthrough~
.Welcome to the walk through for people playing a mud for the very first
time.  For the purposes of this walk through we're going to assume you
are using a human warrior of non-evil alignment.  If not go ahead and
create a one to practice with until you get the hang of this.  Here's
of 10), how much it cost per increase, how many practices it will take per level increase, and what prerequisites there are (if any).
 Quit this character.
 Wait 5 minutes (policies require this) and reconnect.
 When you reconnect select option 2, start new character.
  (for this you will need your account name and account password)
 Follow the prompting and create a new character, one that is:
  a Human Warrior   of Neutral Good alignment.
 Come back to this help file and read the next section.
    
@G- - - - - - - - - -@n
   
First, type sleep and hit enter.  For now, all the things you need to do
and learn can be done asleep and it will prevent some of the excess
chatter while you learn.
   
If you start getting messages stating you are hungry or thirsty, type
wake and hit enter, type pray and hit enter, type sleep and hit enter. 
Then resume with this lesson.  Typically you will need to eat food and
drink water, but pray will work in a bind.  Don't use it to often later,
as it takes time to build up and you may need it later.  For now though,
it should suffice as we don't know how long it will take you to get
through the learning process.  :) 
   
@G- - - - - - - - - -@n
   
@CWhat you're looking at@n
   
The sreen should be showing you the room's name, a description of it,
possibly the exits, and at the bottom of the screen you will have some
numbers and letters in <> brackets.  The title and room description
should be fairly easy to figure out.  The @cprompt@n at the bottom (in <>
brackets) are statistics about you and the room that will be quite useful
to you quite often.
  @Yhp@n means Hit Points.  Its a measure of how much life you have.
     (at 0 you are unconscious and dieing.  at -10 you are dead)
  @Ye@n  means Energy.  Spell casters use this to cast spells.
     (as a warrior ignore this for now.)
  @Ymv@n means Movement.  Its a measure of vigor and vim.
     (when its at 0 you can not leave the room or move and must rest)
    
You should also have a list of letters after it.  These are the room
exists visible to you at this time.  @YN@north @YE@nast @YS@nouth
@YW@nest @YU@np or @YD@nown.  There are sometimes other exits, but you
must read the room description and find the hidden commands to open them. 
Example: perhaps a boulder blocks an exit to the east.  Typing move
boulder might move it far enough to reveal an exit if you are strong
enough.
   
@G- - - - - - - - - -@n
   
@CEnhancing your character@n
  
Starting out you'll have a few skills.  Some weapon proficiencies, some
non-weapon skills, and the ability to understand primal language (what
imms use so everyone can understand them) and to speak and understand
humanic (the human language).  You can see what skills you have already
and what you can currently learn by using the @CAbility@n command. 
Typing @Cabil weapon@n will show you what weapon skills you can learn at
this level, which ones you already know (to what proficiency level, max
of 10) and how much it costs per increase in level.
Typing @Cabil@n alone will show you what other ability types you can
check for.  In this case: @Cabil weapon@n, @Cabil language@n, and @Cabil
physical@n.  We can skip spells for now as warriors do not have access to
spells.  Only spell casters like clerics and mages or specialized
warriors like paladins and rangers can learn spells.
    
As a starting warrior you know a little bit about using daggers.  You
could wield a sword right now, but it wouldn't be very effective.  We can
see, by checking abil weapon, that to learn to use a sword (typically
much more efficient for killing things than a dagger) you would need to
learn the prerequisite of dagger to level 5.  We can do this in one of
two ways.
First, you can use @Cpractice points@n to have someone train you to use a
dagger better.  Once your dagger skill reaches level 5, you can then
begin learning sword skill.
Second, you can learn through experience.  By wielding a dagger in
combat, there is a random chance you will either improve in dagger skill
or learn something from it and gain a practice point for future use.  For
some skills (primarily spells) the check is made whenever the skill or
spell is used.  For things in almost constant use, like weapon skills or
searching or hiding, the check is made periodically.  If you used the
skill since last check, then a check is made to see if you randomly
improve or not.  What determines success?  Intelligence and Wisdom both
contribute in some ways to how easily you improve.  Having a low
intelligence or wisdom will decrease your abilities in the long run. 
Having a high intelligence and wisdom will earn you more practices and
improvements over time, but it will come at the cost of other skills like
strength, endurance and dexterity.  the skill primarily used for fighting.

wanted <name of clan> : lists those people wanted by a particular clan

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

When you kill something in a clan, it adversely affects your reputation. 
If you kill enough members of a clan, or friends of a clan, you could be
either kicked out of your own clan or become wanted by a particular clan. 
Once pkill is re-implemented, players will be able to collect bounties on
other players, but presently that is not supported.  Once kicked out of a
clan, you become clanless, and as such are naturally suspect in the eyes
of more 'reputable' members of society (the various clans).  Clanless
members will soon be able to join the Outcasts, who have their own hidden
city and system of support.  Their city, Darkhaven, is a perilous place,
so be warned.

.@eDESCRIPTION@n
An enormous, abandoned dwarven mine lies just north of the war-torn city
of Medienne, near the wide expanse of rolling hills.  It has been said
that a coven of powerful warlocks of pure evil and wanton destruction now
occupy the mine, having defeated and enslaved the dwarves who had first
discovered the site.  A tired old dwarf known as Gimnod currently resides
outside the mine, and if asked politely, would graciously offer to answer
any questions regarding this mysterious place.

0 0 15 Warrior~
.@IWarriors are skilled in the art of war.  Usually having dismal mental
abilities, warriors cannot cast spells of any type, and hence believe
almost solely in brute force.  At a young age, they learn how to
@Ekick@n, @Ebash@n, @Eparry@n, and use a @Eshield@n more effectively. 
@IFrom there, warriors gain the important skills of @Erescue@n,
@Eguard@n, and multiple attacks up to five, as well as the unique skill
of using another weapon in their @Eoff-hand@n.  Warriors are the only
class  able to learn @ESecond-Off Handed Attack@N, and due to their
superior combat abilities are one of the underpinnings of ANY successful
group.

0 0 4 weight~
.This helpfile is made to be a GENERAL, LOOSE-FITTING reference for object
weights.

@b@CSWORDS:@n
The medieval longsword was steel, about 7 lbs or so (weight of 70 here). 
Two-handers, such as claymores, etc, were around 10-12 lbs, unless you
had REAL monster of a sword.  That's weight 100-120 here.  Short swords
should be about oh 4-5 lbs, save the speical ones that might push 6.
 
@b@CAXES:@n
An axe looks mostly wood, but it's weight is nearly all in its metal.
Axes weigh about on the same order as swords, if not a tad heavier.
 
@b@CSPEARS AND STAFFS:@n
Mostly just wood, so appx.  3 lbs or so.  The more intricate spear heads
could add a pound I suppose.
 
@b@CDAGGERS:@n
Light.  Light, light, light.  A 3 lb dagger is HEAVY.  probably pseudo 2
pounds for your heavy duty daggers at most.
 
@b@COTHER:@n
Just use your best judgement.  Try to think, would this object weight
more or less than a big ole two-hander?  Remember two-handers go for
about 120 weight here, big weapons like giant claymore i suppose could

0 0 0 Welcome Back~
.Welcome back to The Forests Edge.  Many of you have been active during
our period of revision, and are aware of the changes, however, they may
be more widespread then you realize.  Rather then try to squeeze them all
into the MOTD or annoucments, this file summarizes them.  If you are a
new player, please read all the introductory help files - this is just a
brief summary of differences designed for experienced players.

@BAtmosphere and related code@n: Our desire is to support a role-playing
environment in which ogres and ents are enemies, not companions. 
Ideally, reputations would take care of much of this, but as a perhaps
interim measure, Greyclaw has provided code which prohibits introductions
and groupings between 'light' and 'dark' races.  As of the time of this
document, options for lizards and humans are still undetermined.

Although this is primarily NOT a PK (player killing) mud, a few areas
have been marked as allowing such actions.  At the present time, this is
restricted to the elven village and gnomish picnic, both areas which
'good' players would only enter to role play and/or destroy those trying
to harm their friends.  Any other areas added will be of the same nature.

@BNames, appearances, etc.@n: Although this is actually part of the first
topic, it is being separated to avoid being lost or ignored.  All names
must follow our stated policies of being in keeping with a medieval
european theme, and not being a rip-off of a well-known fantasy character. 
Appearances, keywords, and descriptions must also follow our documented
standards.  Not every Avatar may recognize there is a problem, so initial
approval does NOT necessarily mean everything is acceptable.  Old
characters with 'good' names do have the option of keeping their names:
imposters will be renamed without warning.

OOC is to be used for OUT of character conversations, gossip and chat for
in-character ones.  We will reduce gossip points as we feel fit.

@BChanges to areas, equipment, stats, etc.@n: Yes, these have happened. 
We have purposely modified many of the old 'newbie' areas both to upgrade
the text as well as to give old players some surprises.  We have
implemented a tougher set of equipment standards, though this will not be
as obvious until players get into the 'better' stuff.  Some changes to
player races and classes have been made in our continuing attempt to make
them separate but equal.  Trainers have been moved around quite a bit as
well, and will require some thinking/questing to find at times.  No
specifics are being given regarding the above topics - assume everything
is different and act accordingly.

@BBugs@n: There are bound to be a bunch of these.  Our long-time policy
on bug abuse will be enforced - if you find one, and don't report it,
beware the wrath of the gods.  And no, this does not mean a typo in a
room, but rather something that actually affects game play.  Minor ones
should be posted to the bugs board, major items (like mobs that don't
fight back, bags of holding repopping in Chiiron bank) should be reported
directly to an imm.  We are working on getting all bugs out: if they have
been posted to a board, please do not continually re-post.

@BWhines@n: Please wait.  We are, as always, a work in progress. 
Suggestions via the ideas board are always considered.  We are trying
very hard right now to make the mud playable, incorporating many new
things.  Whines do NOT help, and serve primarily to annoy everyone.

0 0 19 Western Plains~
.Not for the faint of heart, these plains are populated by savage beasts. 
Lions await to make you their prey, while rhinos and elephants guard
their territory.  In this untamed wild, it is survival of the fittest.
The plains lie to the distant northwest, almost unto the great deserts.

0 0 14 Whisper~
.@eSYNTAX@n

whisper : lists previous whispers
whisper <player in room> <message> : whispers something to another player
in the same room 

@eDESCRIPTION@n

Whisper is used to communicate to another player in the same room as you
are and uses the language you are currently speaking.  Only the person
you whispered to will see what you just said, but others in the room will
see that you just whispered something to that person.

0 0 14 Whistle~
.@C@bSYNTAX@n

whistle : whistle

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Whistling is how you attract your pets.  If they are within a certain
range, they will hear your summons and respond, moving toward you to the
best of their abilities and movement.  Due to their unique racial
characteristics, Lizardmen are unable to whistle and must therefore find
some other means of communicating with their pets.

0 0 8 who~
.@CSYNTAX@n

@Gwho@n    : lists all visible players on

@CDESCRIPTION@n

The who list will list all players who are visible and online.  Each
player is placed in a category according to how well you know them.  The
first category is self-explanatory: @cImmortal@n.  The @cbefriended@n category
will list all people who are on that are @cbefriended@n to you.  The @cknown@n
category lists people who you are introduced to but not @cbefriended@n.  The
@cunknown@n category lists people who you have not been introduced to.  Each
player can only appear once on the who list, so someone who is @cbefriended@n
will not appear in the @cknown@n category.

0 0 12 Wimpy~
.@C@bSYNTAX@n

wimpy : list current wimpy settings
wimpy <field> <value> : sets your wimpy to kick in at a value
wimpy <field> 0 : turns off that field

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Wimpy causes you to flee when your hit points go below your wimpy value. 
You will attempt to flee automatically, so remember to turn it offat the
appropriate times or it could get you into more trouble than the good it
may do.  Your maximum wimpy value depends upon level and your maximum hit
points.  Note that wimpy is @bNOT@n failsafe, and comes with no ironclad
guarantees, but it's usually better than nothing.

The available fields are Flee, Blink and Recall.  When your hit points go
below the value of a field, you will attempt to either flee, recite a
scroll of recall if you have one, or cast the spell 'blink' if you are a
mage.  Again, this is not failsafe, so be warned.

0 0 1 Wither~
.Those well in tune with nature are able, at times, to call upon it to
cause their mortal enemies to wither and die.  This high-level spell does
two things simultaneously: it causes the target to lose some of their
life force (constitution) as well as immediate damage due to the magical
strength of the spell.

0 0 9 World Map~
.
This is by no means an accurate or to scale representation of this
world. This map is merely provided as a tool to aid you in your 
conceptualization of the geopolitical layout of this world.
The biggest misrepresentation this map gives is the illusion that Human
region (Chiiron and Medienne) is both central and considerably larger
than the other regions. This is simply not the case - we simply have not
completed the other regions and cannot provide a similar level of detail.

0 0 0 Wrath Wyrms~
.There have been reports of odd tremors in the surface near Kha-Da.  A
dwarven corpse was found lying on the snow just west of the city, half
its body eaten away and covered in a thick layer of green slime.  Other
dwarves have witnessed large snakelike creatures burrowing around in the
snow near the site of the dead corpse, and strange holes have been dug
through the snow into the earth.

all, notes, quest, rtable }

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Saves the various files to disk.  Becareful with write all as it produces
a decent amount of lag.  If no field is specified the default is the area
you are in.

0 0 14 Yell~
.@C@bSYNTAX@n

yell <string> : sends a string to all rooms in your area

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Use yell to send a message to everyone in your present area.  It costs no
gossip points, and can be useful if, for instance, you become separated
from your group in a perilous place (and you like to roleplay).  It is
also of use when communicating with others not in your group, but still
nearby.  If you wish to send a string to the entire mud, see the
@EShout@n command.

Note that like @EChat@n, @EGossip@n, @EAuction@n, and even @EShout@n, this
is a channel in which profanity is @bnot@n acceptable.

0 0 11 Zap~
.@C@bSYNTAX@n

zap <wand> <target> : zap someone with a wand

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

You use the Zap command to use one of your wands upon a target.  Wands
generally have charges and the use of Zap will expend a charge.  When
depleted of all of their charges, wands make excellent kindling.  You
need to be holding a wand in order to be able to zap with it.
