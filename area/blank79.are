Great Vault~
This large, vaulted quarry stone chamber is just one of a series of
interconnected rooms within the treasure vault of the High King.  To the
north and west, tall stone archways frame the entrances into some of the
other chambers.  Crossing diagonally from the southwest corner of the
chamber to the northeast, a bridge constructed from polished grey quarry
stone arcs across the room. At the highest point, the great arch nears
the ceiling which must be at least thirty feet tall.  A green shelf hangs
from the south wall and to the east lies the majority of the pyramid.

E
shelf green~
Carved completely from malachite, the shelf itself is quite valuable. 
Several trinkets rest on the shelf, though some have been toppled.
~
E
trinkets~
The trinkets on the malachite shelf vary greatly.  On the left end of the
shelf, there is a delicate blue urn.  Next to it is a rusty metal
container.  Placed near it is a slim knife.  Beside the knife is a great
gem.  And next to the gem, there is a small feather and a harp.
~
E
delicate blue urn porcelain~
Standing about a foot tall, this thin urn have been painted with a
weighty blue glaze, giving it a glossy look.  Hieroglyphs of monsters and
cats decorate the exterior of the urn.  Near the porcelain urn on the
shelf, a metal bucket continues to slowly rust into oblivion.
~
E
metal rusting bucket container~
Shaped more like a bucket than anything else, this container stands about
a foot tall and has seen better days.  Rust covers both the exterior and
interior of the bucket and the lip of the container is littered with tiny
rust holes.  It would take a miracle for this bucket to hold water again.
~
E
knife~
Slim and sharp, this skinny knife was probably forged more so as a piece
of cutlery than as a weapon.  The bone handle of the knife shows signs of
much wear and the tip of the knife has been broken off.  Flecks of blood
mar the surface of the knife's otherwise clean, flat blade.
~
E
great diamond gem~
Almost as large as a troll's stomach, an uncut diamond sits
on the shelf. It appears that someone had begun to cut the
smaller end of the potential gemstone but left the task undone.
The great diamond snags your attention, begging to be finished.
~
E
small feather~
This elongated blue feather is like none you have ever seen before.  Like
a snowflake, parts of the feather branch out in an intricate lattice of
detail.  The most unusual part of the feather though is its tip, which
glows with a strong presence of life.
~
E
harp~
At the end of the malachite shelf, a simple wooden harp gathers the dust
of many centuries.  Several strings on the harp have been snapped and the
its base has a large crack in it.
~
E
arching stone bridge~
Constructed from twenty-three precisely cut blocks of grey quarry stone,
the colossal arch which spans this treasure room commands great attention. 
Something about the arch reminds you of something you have seen before. 
Stacked atop the arch, to either side of its keystone, are several
different objects.  Also, below the arch, there is a gigantic chest,
previously unnoticed.
~
E
objects ~
To either side of the arches' keystone, items of treasure
have been stashed. Among them, there is a ceramic flagon, a trophy
of sorts, a pair of jars, and a long tapered candle.
~
E
ceramic flagon~
This tall flagon, though empty for centuries, still smells of stale ale. 
It has a handle and a spout, but the flagon's cap must have broken off. 
Etchings cover the surface of the drinking vessel.
~
E
keystone~
Though the rest of the stone archway is completely non-descript, the
center stone holding the great arch in place is not.  Not only do
pictorial hieroglyphs grace both sides of the keystone, but also, a
fantastically large sword has been plunged into it part way.  Directly
above the pommel of the sword floats a curved black weapon.
~
E
hieroglyphics hieroglyphs~
The hieroglyphs covering the surface of the keystone depict an unusual
scene.  In it, a creature - part woman and part cat - stands facing the
archway.  In her hands she holds some type of sacred artifact and is
pointing it at the archway.
~
E
etchings surface~
The etchings on the surface of the flagon have been filled in with brown
and gold paint.  The designs themselves are of dragons fighting one
another amidst tall sand dunes.  Some of the dragons have been painted
brown and some have been painted yellow.
~
E
trophy~
Though it is uncertain as to function this item served during the reign
of the High King's Dynasty, by your standards it can be nothing more than
a trophy.  This large metal cup is flanked on one side by a gigantic
yellow dragon and on the other by a brown dragon.  Striding the top of
the cup is a man wearing a crown.  In one hand the man holds a sceptre
and in the other he holds a wicked, barbed spear.  The detail put into
the trophy is amazing.  On the base of the trophy is a placard of sorts.
~
E
placard~
The placard attached to the trophy is covered with a string
of hieroglyphs which are completely indecipherable. From what
little you know of this civilization, it probably says something
like: 
    "All Praise the High King for He Was Victorious"
~
E
jars pair~
The two jars sitting on the stone arch are completely identical except
the first jar has but a single hole at the top and the second have four. 
The jars are roughly cylindrical and smell strongly of musty spices.
~
E
gigantic chest~
Made of stone, the gigantic chest resembles more of a sarcophagus than a
container for belongings.  Yet, its shape is strongly suggestive of a
chest.  Nevermind the fact that the stone chest is large enough to house
a horse or three.  The lid of the chest is painted a soft green while the
rest of it is painted blood red.
~
E
lock~
The locking mechanism securing the lid to the rest of the chest looks
very complex.  Couple that with its size, and even the strongest and
nimblest of thieves would be daunted.  The most amazing thing about the
lock is that it has been fashioned from a sapphire!
~
E
lid~
Swirling designs of desert flowers and insects decorate the lid of the
gigantic chest.  Also, around the pixie-sized lock, there is a spiraling
mosaic design of emerald and sapphires.
~
E
curved black weapon~
Just waiting to be grabbed, a curved black weapon floats mystically above
the pommel of the fantastically large sword.  If not for the slightly
triangular tendency of the weapon, one might think it was akin to a
boomerang.  At the end of each curve, a single fragment of amber has been
set into the black metal, probably to add balance.
~
E
blade~
The blade of this massive sword has a serrated edge.  Whoever forged the
blade must have been a master craftsman for not only is the metal of the
blade stronger than any other you have found before, but it is thin and
incredibly lustrous.  Along the flat of the blade, there is an
inscription.
~
E
inscription~
Inscribed upon the flat of the blade, there is a single phrase in an
unknown language.  Only a master linguist could decipher it entirely. 
The phrase looks important enough to bother translating before bothering
further.  But from what you can read, it says: 
       "shabaehae nun beec gladeeum, nuh muheeaehees."
~
E
pommel~
The pommel of the large black metal sword resembles a dragon's claw,
outstretched in rage.  A faceted, clear crystal is clutched in the
grasped of the dragon's claw.  A faint red glow pulses deep within the
heart of the crystal.
~
E
fantastically large sword~
Plunged into the heart of the keystone, a fantastically large sword
almost begs to be withdrawn.  Forged from an unusual black metal, the
large broadsword is extremely menacing.  Its wicked serrated edge
practically screams for blood and the blade and pommel of the sword
vibrate with an inner life.
~
E
long tapered candle~
Smelling of melted camel fat, this tapered black candle stands about two
feet tall.  Notches have been cut into the candle's side at measured
intervals.

Great Vault~
From the southwest corner of the grand treasure vault, there are two
archways leading into other portions of the storage chambers; one to the
north and one to the east.  Held up by stone plugs, a crimson shelf hangs
high about the southern wall.  Armor and weapon racks stand scattered
about the rest of the chamber.

E
red shelf~
Fully thirty feet long, a shelf formed from inferior crushed rubies hangs
from stone plugs on the south wall of the chamber.  Several items of
interest lay on the shelf, including a delicate plate, a dented,
multi-tined instrument, a sparkling silver spoon, a great deck of cards,
a small golden egg, and a simple horn.
~
E
delicate plate~
Large enough to be a serving platter, this large, round plate is made
from a delicate ceramic, possibly even porcelain.  Paintings of serpents
slither around the rim of the plate.
~
E
painting serpents ~
The paintings of serpents along the edge of the delicate plate depict
serpents quite unlike those found commonly in the desert or forests. 
Unlike those, these serpents have broader bodies, craftier eyes, and
sport human-like features and expressions.  In fact, as the serpents make
their way around the rim of the plate, they undergo a type of
metamorphosis, changing from a serpentine form to that of a human with a
serpent's head and a body covered in scales.  The final serpent carries
something which looks quite important in its hand.
~
E
dented multi-tined instrument~
Dented and black from wear and age, this instrument resembles a fork in
many fashions, except it has six tines instead of the usual three or four.
~
E
sparkling silver spoon~
Next to the dented fork-like instrument rests a shiny tool that could
only be a spoon.  Though made of pure silver, not a speck of tarnish has
assaulted the eating implement throughout the ages.
~
E
great deck cards~
Half-rotten from age and use, these thick parchment cards appear to have
once provided entertainment.  There must be nearly a hundred cards in
all, each about the size of a log of wood.  The cards have colorful
pictures on one side, with hieroglyphic surrounding the picture.  On the
back side, each card has a simple pattern disrupted only by an occasional
symmetrically placed marking.
~
E
marking~
On the back of each of these great playing cards, (great because of their
awesome size) a well placed mark mars the otherwise simplistic patterning
each card shares on its back.  Each mark is very tiny, almost
unnoticeable.  Unless familiar with the cards or actively scrutinizing
them, one would never see that the cards were marked.  (Did you expect
the High King of a culture which thrived from at least an eon not to
cheat just a little?  ) 
~
E
small golden egg~
About the size of a hen's egg, this golden wonder stands upright. 
Crafted from a vibrant red-tinged gold, the goldsmith who fashioned this
egg must have spent a great deal of time on it in order to achieve such
balance.  As you turn away, out of the corner of your eye, you see a
hairline seam running around the middle of the egg.
~
E
small golden egg~
About the size of a hen's egg, this golden wonder stands upright. 
Crafted from a vibrant red-tinged gold, the goldsmith who fashioned this
egg must have spent a great deal of time on it in order to achieve such
balance.  As you turn away, out of the corner of your eye, you see a
hairline seam running around the middle of the egg.
~
E
wonder~
You cannot help but stand back and admire the beauty of this golden
wonder.  In fact, its superb craftsmanship reminds you of something or
someone.  Perhaps the goldsmith left his initials on the egg somewhere.
~
E
initials~
Instead of initials, on the bottom of the golden egg, there
is a single word. Strangely enough, the word is most intelligible
and not in hieroglyphics. The High King must have purchased (or
captured) this golden treasure.
~
E
word~
The word on the bottom of the golden egg is very worn. Only
a few letters can be made out:
    "F - B R - G -"
~
E
Faberge~
What are the odds of there being two such skilled goldsmiths with the
same name in the entire universe?
~
E
horn~
At the end of the crushed corundum shelf rests the three foot horn of
some beast.  The inside of the horn is hollow and its tip is silver gilt. 
A loose ragged strap has been tied to both ends of the horn.
~
E
racks ~
Several different racks of all sizes stand about the chamber.  Some
support full sets of bodily protections while others hold weapons.
~
E
bodily protections~
There are four racks upon which armor has been stacked, each in a
different corner of the room.
~
E
northwest~
In the northwest corner of the room stands an armor rack supporting a set
of scale armor.
~
E
northeast~
Upon an armor rack in the northeast corner of the chamber rests some
chain mail.
~
E
southwest~
In the southwest corner of the room, a leather belt hangs off of an armor
rack.
~
E
southeast~
In the southeast corner of the room a set of bracers rests at the foot of
an armor rack.
~
E
weapons~
Racks made of nearly petrified palm wood hold various weapons throughout
the room.  Only the racks of weapons in the cardinal directions look at
all valuable.
~
E
north~
Near the archway to the north stands a weapon rack about six feet tall. 
A wooden longbow leans against it.
~
E
south~
Directly across from a weapon rack holding a longbow, this weapon rack
houses a quiver full of arrows.
~
E
west~
A spiked implement of war, covered in dried blood and ichor, hangs from
this weapon rack to the west.
~
E
east~
From this particular weapon rack near the eastern archway hangs an ornate
flail.
~
E
scale armor~
Supported by an armor rack in the northwest corner of the treasure vault
stands a full set of scale mail armor.  Each individual scale has been
polished to perfection and the entire suit seems to have been made from
the yellow scales of some great reptile.
~
E
chain mail ~
Individual links of both bronze and iron have been fastened together to
form this set of chain mail armor.  Although the bronze links seem only
for ornamentation, the suit of chain mail looks quite formidable.  The
quality of the craftsmanship suggests that this suit of armor once
belonged to someone very important.
~
E
leather belt~
This long belt has been fashioned from the hide of a creature other than
a cow.  The brown, scaly patterning on the back of the belt suggests a
reptile of some sort.  A thick metal buckle is fastened to one end of the
belt.
~
E
arrows~
Roughly fifty arrows are bundled together in a green leather quiver. 
About a foot and a half in length, each arrow has been tipped in silver. 
The quiver has a shoulder strap for easy carrying.
~
E
bow~
The longbow hanging from the weapons rack near the northern archway is
made of a strange type of wood, a cross between oak and palm. 
Hieroglyphics run up and down the bow, ending just a hand span away from
each end.  The long bow has been strung with a long thin cord of tightly
woven hemp.
~
E
spiked implement mace~
Every bit the size and shape of a mace, this spiked
instrument looks like it could cause some serious damage. Twenty
or thirty spikes cover the end of the instrument while its wooden
handle has been wrapped with pieces of black leather for
gripping. Dried blood, ichor, and gobbets of desiccated flesh
cling to a few of the spikes.
~
E
ornate flail~
An ornate golden flail hangs from the weapon rack against the eastern
wall.  The round handle of the flail is about an inch in diameter and
made from solid gold.  Attached to the top of the handle by tiny chain
links are twelve shorter, thinner rods.  Each rod has its own color and
individual length.  The design of the flail is such that when swung, each
of the rods lash out, causing a fair amount of damage.
~
E
rods~
The rods attached to the flail are completely different in color, each
one having been made from a different color of mineral.  There is an
ivory rod, an onyx rod, an obsidian rod, an emerald rod, a rod of stone,
and a clear quartz rod.
~
E
bracers~
Inlaid with lapis lazuli, each gold and silver bracer has been fashioned
into the form of a great predatory feline curled up, asleep.  The
detailing of the bracers is such that at any moment, the feline appears
that it might awaken and begin its hunt once again.
~
E
buckle~
Upon this buckle there is an engraved image of two dragons locked into
combat.
~
E
dragons~
The first dragon is long and sleek while the other is massive and squat. 
Both dragons are depicted as having sharp talons, jagged teeth, and
menacing eyes.

Great Vault~
This chamber is square in shape and the ceiling comes to a point like the
pyramid itself.  Mounds of thin wooden disks against litter the floor.  A
rectangular barge about ten feet wide and twenty feet long rests on the
floor, beneath the apex of the ceiling.  On the western wall an ebony
shelf hangs some five feet off the ground and through archways to the
east, north, and south, other treasure vaults much like this one beckon.

E
ebony shelf~
Fashioned from a hundred or more individual pieces of onyx, this ebony
shelf shines in the light like sunlight on the sand.  Placed on the shelf
are several artifacts, each valuable and unique.
~
E
artifacts~
Six unique and valuable artifacts rest on the shelf.  They include: a
delicate vase, a corroding brass astrolabe, a shiny steel sun dial, a
sculpture of the Great Pyramid, a pair of metal frames holding pieces of
glass, and a hollow reed flute.
~
E
delicate vase~
This delicate vase is the color of volcanic ash.  Pressed into the vase
and trapped by a thick, clear glaze, tiny desert flowers and leaves
decorate the outside of the fragile vase, which probably dates back to
before the Founding of the High Kings Dynasty.
~
E
hollow reed flute     ~
Preserved by a dark resin, this wooden flute still has a note or two left
in it.  On one end of the flute there is a mouthpiece and there are seven
finger holes.  Spiraling designs of ivy and river lilies have been carved
into the sizes of the flute and tiny blue feathers hang from its end.
~
E
brass corroding astrolabe~
Forged from brass, this complex device resembles the astrolabe designed
by the gnome Darfelarius about fifty years ago.  It is comprised of three
disks of brass set inside one another.  Lines of measurement and
hieroglyphics appear all over the device at certain intervals. 
Predominant on the astrolabe are symbols for the moon, sun, and the north
star.  Clumps of green sediment cover parts of this complex instrument
where the worst of the corrosion has set in.
~
E
sun dial shiny steel~
This flat disk of steel gleams like a diamond under the noon day sun. 
Its surface has been polished to perfection.  In the center of the disk,
a slender pole of steel sticks straight up and fully half of one edge of
the steel disk has measured marks.  A hieroglyph has been inscribed in
front of every other mark.
~
E
sculpture great pyramid~
An exact duplicate of the great pyramid you stand within now, this
sculpture possesses the exact same outward detail as the original.  The
only differences are that the outward walls are much smoother and fully
sheathed with limestone.  Also, the tip of the pyramid looks slightly
different as well.
~
E
tip~
Closer scrutiny of the sculpture of the great pyramid reveals that the
tip of the pyramid, instead of being made of limestone and quarry stone
like the real pyramid and the rest of the sculpture, is really made up of
a variety of different minerals.
~
E
pair metal frames pieces glass~
Held in place by a framework of twisted metal wire, two
pieces of curved glass stand upright, bending light. A straight
piece of metal, one to the left of the first circular piece of
glass and one to the right of the other stick out behind them. 
The two glass disks are bridged together by part of the twisted
metal frame. The end of each of the straight pieces curves in a
half crescent shape. The entire apparatus looks to fasten to one's
face.
~
E
raft~
Built probably for ceremonial purposes, a twenty foot raft fills
most of the chamber. Mostly rectangular in shape, the ends of the
raft pull inward and upward to a near point, like the bow of a
ship. A thread bare sail hangs from a short mast mounted towards
the front of the raft. Towards the rear of the raft, there is a
cabin-like nook.
~
E
nook~
At first, the nook resembles a simple room meant for sleeping aboard the
raft.  But the hieroglyphs decorating its exterior walls seemingly allude
to the structure as a type of shrine.
~
E
shrine~
Within the shrine aboard the raft stand six partly humanoid icons.  The
first icon is an onyx statuette of a cat/woman.  Across from her stands
four other icons.  These icons are each a horrible mixture of man and
beast and include: an ivory carving of a man/scorpion, an obsidian idol
of a man/bat, an emerald figurine of a man/serpent, and an opal creation
of a woman/spider.  Stuck between these icons there is yet another; a
stone statue of a gargoyle.
~
E
rubbish pit~
Both horrific and fascinating, a collage of debris lies within the pit. 
Shattered tablets, dirty rags, bits of rock, broken digging implements,
and human bones fill the pit.
~
E
onyx statuette cat~
Carved from a single piece of onyx, a graceful statuette of a woman with
the features of a cat stands within the shrine.  The statuette's body is
that of a woman, but her features and face that of a cat.  The sculpture
has even been given the appearance of fur clinging to the woman's body. 
Her claws/hand are raised in defiance and her eyes, the most remarkable
thing about the statuette, express endless depths of suffering and loss. 
Within her feline jaws, the woman/cat holds a large ruby.
~
E
ruby jaws~
Held between the jaws of the cat headed woman rests a ruby the size of a
panther's heart.  And much like a heart, the ruby pulsates, its soft
crimson glow throbbing slowly.
~
E
ivory carving scorpion~
With its tail lashing out, its stinger ready to strike down any
opposition, this ivory carving is just one of four statues standing in
opposition to the statuette of the cat headed woman.  Featuring the worst
features of both man and scorpion, the creature stands much taller than
the cat woman.  It has the torso and legs of a man, but the tail, head,
and pinchers of a scorpion.  Emeralds serve as eyes for the ivory
abomination.  From the scorpion's stinger hangs a pendant.
~
E
pendant stinger~
Suspended by its fine platinum chain, this filigree pendant hangs from
the stinger of the ivory scorpion carving.  A silver setting hangs from
the chain.  Within the setting is a carnelian jewel cut in much the same
fashion as the scorpion's eyes are.
~
E
obsidian idol bat~
Possessing the features of both man and bat, this idol has been carved
completely out of green obsidian.  With the head, wings, and feet of a
bat and the body of a human, the man/bat idol stands with its mouth open
in a silent shriek facing the cat-headed woman.  An earring hangs from
eat of the man/bat's ears.
~
E
ears earrings~
The pair of earrings the man/bat sports seem quite out of
place on the foot and a half tall idol. The earrings look to
instead match more of a woman's taste. Suspended from thin
threads of silver, a cascade of garnets and peridots spill
downward from oval loops.
~
E
emerald figurine serpent~
Smaller than all the other statues standing in fierce conflict with the
cat headed statuette, this figurine represents what might happen if a
woman and a serpent mated.  She has the body and legs of a woman, but
from her neck sprouts a serpentine head and her arms resemble scaly
tentacles.  Around the emerald serpent/woman's neck hangs a key.
~
E
key neck~
Hanging from a silver chain encrusted with sapphires, a large key
sculpted from emerald catches your attention.  The key is half as large
as the serpentine figurine itself!
~
E
statue stone gargoyle~
Crafted from stone, the statue of a winged beast neither human nor animal
stands between the cat headed statuette and the four other malicious
idols.  It has wings, short horns atop its head, a muscular torso, and
powerful looking arms and legs.  The gargoyle's face, unlike all the
other statues, is impassive.  Neither hate nor compassion mars its smooth
features.  It is as if the gargoyle stands between the two, balancing the
struggle.  In outstretched claws the gargoyle holds a corked glass vial.
~
E
corked vial claws~
Within the corked vial swirls a maelstrom of darkness and
light. Specks of intense light shine within the contents of a
wispy black liquid. It is as if the vial contained all the
essences of the starry universe.
~
E
opal creation spider~
Sculpted from an opal at least the size of a dragon's egg, this wondrous
creation combines the sultry features of a women with hideous traits of a
desert tarantula.  The statue has eight legs and faces off against the
cat headed women.  Where the head of the spider should be rises the torso
of a woman, complete with humanoid hands, arms, and head.  Though her
face is beautiful, her eyes speak only of pain and torment.  Across her
brow, the opal spider woman statue wears a crystal diadem.
~
E
crystal diadem~
A circlet of twisted metal wire rests lightly on the brow of the opal
spider woman statue.  A single piece of crystal, carved to resemble a
rose, holds tight to its wire setting.

#48357
Great Vault~
Two stone archways, each about fifteen feet high and just as wide,
provide passageways into other chambers to the east and south.  Mounds of
colorful disks litter the floor to either side of a lush carpet running
into the southern chamber.  Resting on the center of the carpet in the
middle of the room is a grey pedestal, on which sits a square box covered
with a cloth.  A transparent shelf stretches the length of the western
wall.

E
clear shelf~
Hanging about eight feet off the ground, a clear shelf made of quartz has
been mounted to the west wall.  Upon the shelf, spaced as evenly as
possible, there are six distinct pieces of treasure.
~
E
pieces treasure~
Upon the quartz shelf there are five different sets of items placed at
nearly even intervals.  They include: a delicate plant, a tarnished coin,
a shiny circlet, a set of pipes, and a great collection of multi- faceted
objects.
~
E
delicate palm tree miniature plant~
Remarkably well preserved, a delicate palm sapling has somehow survived
countless centuries entombed within this treasure vault, planted in a
lopsided, ugly little pot.  The palm sways gently and its leaves rustle. 
Yet, there is not a breeze or draft withine chamber.  Next to the
delicate palm plant sits a tarnished coin.
~
E
tarnished coins~
Unlike the delicate palm tree next to it, time has taken its toll on this
artifact.  About the size of a troll's fist, this extremely large coin is
made of copper and is badly tarnished.  Most of the detail has worn away
from the coin, but a vague outline of a feline's graceful body remains on
the back of the coin.  In comparison to the shiny circlet next to it,
this coin would hardly be considered treasure even by a metallurgist.
~
E
shiny circlet~
Resting between a great collection of objects with multiple facets and a
worn, tarnished coin, this shiny circlet stands out above all the other
items on the shelf.  Beaten into shape from a rich, red-gold ore, this
brilliant circlet looks like it would fit a human perfectly.  Nested in
the center of the circlet amidst an elaborate network of filigree sits a
small drop of amber.
~
E
small amber drop~
Someone must have poured a lot of time and thought into the crafting of
this beautiful circlet with its drop of amber nestled in its center. 
Within the small amber drop itself, it appears something has been trapped. 
At first, it looks to be a common insect.  But closer inspection reveals
it to have once been an extremely rare scarab, sought out for its
pearlescent wings.
~
E
great collection multi-faceted objects~
A handful of small objects lay in a pile here on the shelf right beside
the shiny circlet.  Some of them are shaped like cubes and others are
roughly shaped like tiny pyramids.  Still others are shaped liked
pentagonal spheres.  Each faceted face has been etched with a rune or a
hieroglyph.
~
E
reeds pan hollow~
A series of seven hollowed out reeds have been fastened together with
thin strands of hemp.  Each reed is progressively shorter than the one
next to it.  At the base of each reed, there is an indentation meant
presumably for changing the air flowing into each pipe.
~
E
rug carpet ~
A lush red carpet circular in shape with a rectangular strip branches off
and runs into the southern chamber.  Around the edges of the carpet there
appears to be writings or etching and there is a huge design embroidered
within the center of the carpet.  Within the exact center of the design
stands a pedestal carved from grey marble.
~
E
designs~
Spiraling designs have been embroidered on the ancient rug at your feet. 
As the spirals near the center, close to the base of the pedestal, they
flow into the shapes of five unusual, supernatural creatures.  Four of
the creatures look notably more malicious than the fifth and seem to be
fighting the sole figure.
~
E
creatures~
Embroidered into the ancient rug are four evil looking creatures being
fended off by a more graceful, feline form.  The cat-like woman is
depicted protecting a short, arching bridge, through which tendrils of
power are flowing into the feline woman.  Locked into position, the four
creatures, that of bat, spider, serpent and scorpion, look intent on
defeating the cat/woman.  The weaver of this rug was very talented indeed.
~
E
writings edges~
Written in a language slightly older and less foreign than the
hieroglyphs decorating the interior of the pyramid, a single sentence has
been embroidered about the circular edge of the rug.  Though most of it
is indecipherable, two sections seem understandable.  The first refers to
the protection of some great stone bridge and the other mentions simply
the name "Karanaya." 
~
E
pedestal grey~
Carved from a rich grey marble, this pedestal stands about four feet in
height.  The pedestal is oval-shaped with several hieroglyphs decorating
it.  Depicted on the surface of the pedestal, there is a very large cat
viciously ripping two symbols of rulership from an equally tall figure
sitting in a throne.  Behind the pedestal, there is a massive melting
crucible perched above a pile of wood.
~
E
square box~
A square box, really a cube, sits upon the pedestal.  A cloth wraps and
encircles the cube, preventing further inspection.  Atop the box, sitting
on the cloth, is a piece of what appears to be fruit.
~
E
cloth~
Wrapped about a cube-shaped box on the pedestal, this cloth fully
conceals the exterior and contents of whatever lies beneath it.  The
cloth itself is made of soft satin which has been dyed a vibrant, sky
blue.  Except for its remarkably well preserved color, there is nothing
outstanding about the cloth wrapped about the square box.
~
E
fruit~
What first appears to be a piece of well preserved fruit in
actuality is a piece of fruit made from pure gold! About the size
of a desert dragon's eye, this golden fruit would fetch a
remarkable price most assuredly.
~
E
large blue-green trident shaft~
Stuck into the pile of wood, a blue-green metal shaft is
attached to a three-pronged trident, whose tips are made of
crystal. Within each crystal prong there seems to be something
trapped.
~
E
prong ~
Examining the prongs of the trident closer, there indeed are things
embedded within each tine.  Within the first, there is a miniature amulet
of gold, no bigger than a gnome's thumbnail and too small even for an
atomie sprite.  Embedded in the center prong there is a tiny emerald key,
about the size of a flower petal.  And within the third of the trident's
crystalline tines floats a perfectly round sphere of an iridescent white
color.
~
E
massive melting crucible~
Tucked behind the grey marble pedestal, this melting crucible has seen
its better days.  Though made from a sturdy combination of platinum and
an unknown ore, the crucible is dented and blackened from severe use. 
Leaning against the melting crucible is a black leather and metal framed
instrument.
~
E
pile wood~
A pile of hard, almost petrified wood has been stacked under the massive
melting crucible.  The wood is old and rotten and looks to have been
sitting here for more than just a couple of centuries.  A shaft of
blue-green metal sticks out of the pile of wood.
~
E
black leather instrument~
Framed in metal and covered in a charcoal colored leather, this
instrument once functioned as a primitive bellows.

#48358
Great Vault~
To the west and south, tall archways brace the stonework around the
entrances to other parts of this humongous treasure vault.  The refined
quarry stone walls have been smoothed to perfection and the floor
polished with equal skill.  In the center of this chamber, a raised dais
topped with a regal stone throne garners the most attention.  On the
eastern wall, to the right of the throne, hangs a long white shelf about
seven feet off the ground.

E
throne~
Standing in the exact center of the raised dais, the stone throne faces
to the south.  The stone itself is mostly square in shape and looks
ruthlessly hard to sit on.  While most of the throne has been sculpted
from the same, yellow-orange quarry stone that the rest of the pyramid
has, the arms of the regal seat of power have been gilded; the left in
silver and the right in gold.  All about the throne there are hieroglyphs.
~
E
hieroglyphs~
The hieroglyphs about the base of the throne depict a series of men
standing in a line, each looking remarkably like the one standing next to
him.  Each man is dressed in a flowing robe of sorts and is being handed
a bejeweled sceptre.  At the beginning of the line, a figure twice the
height of the first man, holds a gem encrusted crown out to the man, who
is bowing his head in what looks to be worship.  The tall figure, though,
resembles a cat more than a human.
~
E
niche ~
Situated roughly behind the throne, an alcove about five feet tall and
three feet wide sits completely empty.  However, where the quarry stones
meet within the little niche, there is a slight crack.
~
E
crack~
The crack is the result not of bad craftsmanship but of design.  It
appears that there might be some way of opening the crack up further, to
allow passage north.
~
E
white shelf~
This white shelf is about fifty feet long and made
completely of ivory. Upon the shelf there are many items, each
distinct from the one next to it.
~
E
items~
Cluttering the shelf, there are six different items, each one a piece of
the vast hoard belonging to the now deceased High King, for whom the
pyramid was built for.
~
E
green glass delicate vial~
A delicate glass vial in the shape of a graceful swan lies on the white
shelf.  Within the emerald colored glass, a bubbly, aromatic liquid
reminds you of a dew covered spring morning.  Next to the green glass
vial, the remains of a candelabra corrode into nothingness.
~
E
corroding candelabra~
Though not much remains of this once elegant candelabra, it is apparent
that at one time it was quite valuable.  The base of the tiered candle
holder retains the shape of a coiled serpent, but the rest of the
candelabra has succumbed to heavy corrosion.  Beside the serpentine
candelabra a bracelet shines with a luster bright enough to light the
darkest room.
~
E
shiny bracelet~
Next to the corroding serpentine candelabra, a petite bracelet shines
with a light of its own.  The wrist circlet looks to be made of white
gold and has five gems set into it.  Two rubies flank on either side a
faceted diamond cabochon.  Next to the shiny bracelet, a great shield as
large as a human is tall, takes up a significant portion of the bone
white shelf.
~
E
great shield~
Crafted from a rich mix of jewels and bronze, this great shield is shaped
like a giant upside-down tear.  Around the edges of the shield, cut
sapphires sparkle and shine.  In the center of the body shield, there is
a tiled mosaic, depicting the High King, raising his black sword against
a gathering of four malicious creatures.  The creatures loom over the
King, intent on usurping his power.  Each of the creatures seems to be a
bizarre combination of an animal or insect and a troll-sized human.
~
E
small bag~
Insignificant beside the massive shield, a small bag made of
velvet lies on the shelf, collecting dust. Dried and cracked
leather drawstrings close the bag and have been tied off. There
would be no way of opening the black velvet bag without
destroying the ancient bag entirely. At the end of the shelf,
there is a stringed instrument.
~
E
stringed musical instrument~
Rare even now, this stringed musical instrument is strongly
reminiscent of a violin. Made of palm wood, the body of the
instrument has remained remarkably well preserved. Flowery gilded
designs flow up and down the length of the instrument.
~
E
raised dais~
In the center of the room, a dais raises from the floor, made from
precisely cut quarry stones slightly darker than those found throughout
the rest of the pyramid.  Carved into parts of the dais, runes of an
unknown origin glow slightly with a sickly green luminescence.  Scattered
on the three-tiered steps of the dais, a few pieces of treasure lay
toppled.  Atop the dais rests a tall, square throne made of normal quarry
stone.
~
E
runes ~
Though the runes carved into the dais resemble the hieroglyphics chiseled
into the walls throughout the pyramid, these are notably different. 
Instead of depicting a frozen scene of life or a part of history, these
runes take on a life of their own and undulate around the dais, their
green glow seemingly cursing the existence of the throne above.
~
E
toppled treasure~
Though many have been smashed or destroyed, a few pieces of interesting
treasure lay scattered about the raised dais.  Among them, there is a
device filled with water and made from silver, an hourglass crafted from
gold and glass as clear as water, a blue bottle with etchings on its
sides, a tall, chipped flask made of red glass, a box of coarse
parchment, and a worn book of bound palm paper.
~
E
hourglass clear gold~
Fashioned from pure gold and crystal clear glass, this timepiece is
filled with four different colors of sand, probably taken from four
sections of the Southern Narak Desert.  Strangely, the sands do not mix;
rather, they remain separate and distinct.  From the looks of the
hourglasses' interior, it was used often.
~
E
water device silver ~
Within a framework of metal and silver rests two spheres, both half
filled with water.  The framework has been cunningly crafted to resemble
a dragon hatchling.  The top sphere forms the bulk of its head while the
bottom sphere is the dragonling's body.  Two rubies serve as eyes for the
dragon hatching and polished bits of ivory have been fashioned for claws
and teeth.  Every so often, a single drop of water falls into the sphere
below it, roughly every minute.
~
E
blue bottle~
Turned over on its side, a blue bottle with etched sides is about to fall
from the dais and smash onto the floor.  The bottle is stoppered with a
wedge of cork and has been sealed with wax.  A murky cloud of mist seems
trapped within the bottle.
~
E
etchings sides~
The etchings along the side of the bottle are quite foreign and
altogether too ancient to fully comprehend.  From the way the etchings
curve angrily, an obvious sense of caution and warning is conveyed.
~
E
chipped tall red flask~
This hand blown flask of red glass is completely empty and
nearly as worthless. There are flaws in its form and the lip of
the flask is chipped. One might wonder why the High King might have
favored such a worthless item.
~
E
box coarse parchment~
Made of palm wood, a crude box has been fitted together to hold a stack
of coarse parchment.  Each sheet of the parchment is made of pounded
reeds and palm bark.  Though cumbersome, the parchment must have served
an important roll within the dynasty of the High King.  Some twenty or
thirty sheets of parchment might fill the box, but it is impossible to
tell, for each sheet is bulky and imperfect, leaving the stack uneven.
~
E
inkwell~
Though stoppered, this tiny vial of ink has long since dried up.  The
vial is oblong and thin, with a slightly wider base.  The ink itself is
of a deep red color and partly gritty.  A derivative of the red sand no
doubt.
~
E
book bound paper~
Resting on the raised dais just below the throne, this book is about two
inches thick and bound together with strips of leather and covered in a
thin, scaly brown hide.  The pages of the book are made from the same
pieces of coarse parchment within the box and are covered with
hieroglyphics painted in red ink.
~
E
pages~
Thumbing through some of the pages within the dragonskin bound book, the
hieroglyphs depict various scenes of the High King's life.  From his
birth during the third darkening of the sky to his entombment.

Great Vault~
Mounds upon mounds of treasure and wooden disks lay strewn all about this
storage vault and in several other adjoining chambers beyond it.  A
yellow shelf bearing remarkable pieces of treasure hangs above the
archway to the south and a very large, nearly gigantic bed takes up
nearly a quarter of the chamber.  Even larger piles of wooden disks
surround the bed.  To the north, west and south, exits framed by tall
archways proceed into additional chambers of the treasure vault.

E
wooden disks~
The mounds of wooden disks piled throughout the room are made from
rounded bits of palm wood.  Some of the disks are larger than others and
are different colors.  The wooden disks were once probably this ancient
culture's main currency.
~
E
shelf yellow~
Shaped from a single piece of rare fresh water yellow coral, this ornate
and twisted shelf hangs from the wall by the grace of small stone plugs. 
Upon the shelf are several interesting pieces of treasure.
~
E
treasure~
Assorted bits of treasure has been stacked upon the yellow coral shelf. 
On the very left sits a delicate drinking vessel.  Next to it, a set of
leather armor rots away into nothingness.  Beside the rotting leather
armor shines a goblet and beside it, plunged into the coral itself stands
a great dagger with a jewel encrusted hilt.  Finally, at the end of the
shelf rests a silver egg and a small stringed instrument.
~
E
delicate drinking vessel~
This delicate drinking vessel has been meticulously crafted from an
animal's tusk.  The sides and base of the vessel have been decorated and
etched thoroughly.  At any moment you might expect some of them to come
alive and jump off the vessel itself.  The rim of the vessel has been
gilded in gold and every single animal etching has polished and cut topaz
gems for eyes.
~
E
rotting leather set armor~
A set of leather armor lies on the shelf, folded neatly.  The leather,
though mostly rotten, might still serve as good protection.  Emblazoned
on the shoulder of the armor is an emblem.
~
E
emblem~
Rising out of an azure background of sky, a pair of dragons, one yellow
and one brown are engaged in aerial combat upon the emblem adorning the
set of rotten leather armor.  The yellow dragon holds a sceptre in an
outstretched claw and the brown dragon has a firm grasp on a bejeweled
crown.
~
E
shiny goblet~
Shining like the desert star on a cloudless night, this grand goblet
truly was meant for a king.  Intertwined around the base and stem of the
platinum goblet, a serpentine figure rises up, its head level with the
top of the drinking vessel.  It has rubies for eyes and malachite chips
for scales.  While the goblet itself shines brightly, its serpentine
counterpart seems to do nothing but detract from the kingly vessel.
~
E
great jewel encrusted dagger~
A dagger nearly twice the size of any ordinary dagger has
been plunged into the heart of the yellow coral shelf. Its blade
seems to quiver at your approach and the pommel of the dagger
sparkles brightly. The sides of the dagger have been inlaid with
cut gemstones of various quality and size and the crossbars on
the hilt of the dagger no doubt were forged to intentionally
resemble clawed talons.
~
E
pommel~
Within the pommel of the dagger a tiger-eye gem, about the
size of a platinum coin, gleams brightly. The brownish-green gem
has been polished and carefully mounted in the pommel of the
jewel encrusted dagger with its "eye" facing completely
outward...
          ...Wait a second...did the eye just blink?
~
E
blade~
Razor sharp and deadlier than a common short sword, the blade of the
jewel encrusted dagger rests stuck in the yellow coral shelf.  The
craftsmanship and forging of the blade resemble nothing else within the
great pyramid.  Part of an inscription can be read on the blade.
~
E
inscription~
The inscription upon the blade in written not in
hieroglyphs, but in something much less "primitive." Only half
the inscription can be read, but what it implies sounds
intriguing.
    
"-------------------Alegra the magesmi
-------------------do I draw my Sight."
~
E
silver egg~
Perfectly oval, some silver smith has fashioned an egg from a lump of
silver.  Somewhat larger than a robin's egg, the silver treasure has no
markings or otherwise distinguishable features.  It is completely
non-descript.
~
E
small rounded string instrument~
A pear-shaped gourd about a foot and a half tall has been hollowed out
and made into a musical instrument.  A hole has been cut into the surface
of the gourd to provide for sound alteration and the neck of the
instrument is made of palm wood.  Six strands of some type of gut are
attached to the instrument, running down the length of its neck to its
bridge just below the hole.
~
E
gigantic bed~
Off to one side of the room stands a gigantic bed, large enough to
comfortably sleep six or more.  A canopy of fine silk drapes over the bed
from four tall posts and thick black and red coverlets enshroud the bed
itself.  A pair of boots lean against the foot of the bed.
~
E
handle~
The handle next to the boots belongs to a black metal axe which has been
shoved under the bed.
~
E
axe~
For whatever reason, an axe has been shoved under the gigantic feather
bed.  The blade of the battle axe has been forged from a flat black metal
and attached to a wooden handle bound with strips of leather.  On the
blade of the axe there are numerous patterns and designs.
~
E
patterns designs~
The patterns and designs of the face of the battle axe are very much like
hieroglyphs but seem to have a more specific purpose.  The designs
themselves are of dragons being sliced to bits by the axe's blade.

Inside the Niche~
Ah ha!  The presence of this chamber proves that there is more than meets
the eye within the ancient pyramid.  No telling how many hidden passages
there are.  This niche behind the throne of the High King holds pieces of
treasure within its tightly cramped confines.  Placed on tiny shelves all
their own, there is a small amulet, a folded garment of some kind, a
miniature red cart, a helm, and a pair of sandals.
~
~

D2
~
~
0 -1 48358 10 10 5
E
helm ~
Forged from iron and gilded partly in gold, this great helm has a visor
held on by small silver rivets.  The armor smith who forged the helm went
to great lengths to imbue it with the visage of a falcon.  The sides of
the helm look like smoothed feathers and the visor hooks sharply like a
falcon's beak.  Beneath the visor there is only darkness.
~
E
darkness~
Staring into the helm through the opened visor, you catch a brief glance
of something gleaming in the darkness.
~
E
folded garment~
The folded garment is a simple apron, colored grey from use and age.
~
E
small amulet~
Suspended from a chain of gold, this tiny amulet is round in shape and
has a smooth silver backing.  Carved in gold and delicately joined with
the silver back piece is the design of a cat headed woman.  A deep crack
runs down the center of the amulet.
~
E
miniature red cart~
This miniature cart stands about two feet tall and has four small wheels,
each painted a darker red than the rest of the wagon.  Down the sides of
the wagon, there are flaming orange designs.  Inside the cart, there is a
pitted iron anvil and a handful of colorful stones.
~
E
sides~
Along the sides of the little red wagon there are flames of orange
pigmented into the wood.  The flames curl and dance about and seem to
form an intricate hieroglyphic.
~
E
sandals~
These petite leather sandals are grey in color and have hard leather
soles which would be perfect for traveling long distances.  The sandals
fasten together with tiny brass buckles and a pair of emeralds set into
the leather foot gear wink shyly at ankle height.
~
E
handful stones~
At first, the handful of colorful stones at the bottom of the red wagon
look like sparkling magic rocks.  In reality, though, the colorful stones
are a small pile of uncut gems.
~
E
pitted iron anvil~
The pitted iron anvil in the bottom of the little red cart
is quite crude. Nevertheless it appears to have witnessed much
use. Unlike most anvils used by blacksmiths, this anvil has a
flatter base.
~
E
base~
The base of the anvil looks to have been unnaturally broadened, perhaps
by repeated contact with a hard surface.  You also note that there are a
few hairs wedged into one of the iron pits on the bottom of the anvil.
~
E
hairs~
Snagged within one of the pitted iron holes of the anvil there are four
brown and tan hairs.  If you did not know better, you would think these
hairs belonged to a coyote, but not a very wily one.

Inside the Chest~
Though it is impossible to reach the lid from within the chest, notches
on the western side of the fifteen foot deep chest look deep enough to
provide hand holds.  Within the gigantic stone chest several items have
been carefully placed at the bottom along its lining.

E
lid~
Lined with velvet, the stone lid to the gigantic chest lay open against
the bed some fifteen feet about your head.  Mystical hieroglyphs adorn
its underside.
~
E
hieroglyphs mystical~
Though it is unclear as to the exact meaning of any hieroglyph, the ones
on the underside of the lid depict scenes of death and destruction should
the lid of the chest be closed while occupied.
~
E
notches western~
The notches on the western side of the chest were obviously cut to allow
someone to climb out of the treasure chest.  The notches are quite deep
and sturdy.
~
E
eastern lining~
Hidden with the lining of velvet, a single cord of thick silk hangs from
the eastern edge of the chest.  It would be easy enough to climb the cord.
~
E
bejeweled box~
Pearls, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, peridots, carnelian's, and
amethysts cover every square inch of this foot long rectangular box.  The
jewelry box has a delicate bronze latch but no lock.
~
E
latch~
Made of bronze, a curved piece of metal on the boxes' lid, much like a
miniature scythe, hooks into an interlocking catch below.  It would not
take much to open the latch on the bejeweled box.
~
E
spike handle letter opener~
A iron spike about seven inches long protrudes from a rounded wooden
handle.  Though it could be used as a weapon, the mundane object would
probably be more useful for opening letters.
~
E
signet ring~
The intaglio design incised into the gold forms the crest of the High
King.  The design itself is a single string of hieroglyphics, written in
hieratic form, so individual letters can at least be deciphered.  Only an
expert would be able to tell you what it means, though. 
"J-u-p-a-n-I-e-g-o-b-a-" 
~
E
sealing wax~
Next to the High King's signet ring there is a single stick of red wax. 
The wax smells very pungent and musty.  Flecks of silver and gold sparkle
throughout the red sealing wax.  This plain container is made of polished
palm ebony wood.  There are no seams on the box, nor does there appear to
be any way to open it.  The cube's surface has no markings, except for a
single hieroglyph upon each of its six faces.  Each hieroglyph depicts a
scene of disaster.
~
E
items~
@B@G
Among them, there is a signet ring, a handle with a spike sticking up out
of it, a bejeweled box, and a stick of wax.
