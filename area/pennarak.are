#36250
Greened Way~
Towering hills rise to either side of the path, tough brush and lichen
clinging to their almost vertical walls.  The dense, tall carpet of grass
stretches east and west, brushing against your legs as you wade through
it.  Near the edges of the path, the grass has gone to seed in places.

#36251
Greened Way~
The road runs east and west here, and to either side of the road rise
steep hills, punctuated with an occasional boulder.  Dense brush lines
the wayside, and creeps up the faces of the surrounding hills.  The road
descends deeper into the hills to the west.

Greened Way~
Underfoot are the lush grasses of Greened Way, and to either side of the
road rise steep hills, effectively barring passage to north and south. 
Dense brush lines the wayside, giving way on the northern side of the
road to a small copse of trees which extends to the west.

Greened Way~
A copse of short, tenacious trees struggle resolutely up the steep face
of the hill bordering the northern edge of the road.  The stubborn brush
prevalent to this region blankets the hills south of the trail, and the
view down the trail to the west is dominated by a towering cliff face.

Greened Way~
A cliff face creates a natural barrier to the west, rising to a dizzying
height.  The road swerves south here, to run along the base of the cliff. 
Passage to the north is barred by a treacherous hillside, dotted with
scrub and rubble.

Greened Way~
An archway has been cut in the rock wall to the west, a work of immense
proportion, showing that this road was once considered an important
highway.  Even in its shadow grow the grasses of the Way.  To the east,
steep hills rise, and to the south is a huge moss-covered pile of rubble. 
Perhaps this is the stone that was carved from the living face of the
rock to allow man's passage.

Perhaps an abondoned waystation (guards and/or traveler lodging) here or
one west.  Could have been an inn-type thingie or a travelers' shrine..

The road passes through a man-made archway in the rock wall to the east,
a symbol of a time when this road was a major thoroughfare.  The lush
grass of the road cushions your footfalls, lending this artifact of a
bygone age a measure of hushed solemnity.  The rocky hills, constant
companions on your journey, border the road on the south and west.

A steep hill to the west bars passage in that direction, though it is

the hillside is sparse and brown, in vivid contrast to the vibrant,
knee-high grasses of the trail beneath your feet.

The road is somewhat narrower here, bordered on the west by the face of a
rocky hill and on the east by a sheer rock wall.  Though other vegetation
seems to have given up this area as uninhabitable, the grasses that give
the road its name thrive here, as well.  A boulder lies here in the
center of the road, perhaps fallen from above.

and flowing water, then vanishes from your senses, leaving the
now-familiar smell of sun-warmed grass.

Grasslands Road~
The road curves from south to west, a beaten way of bare earth.  Grasses
as tall as your waist (if you're a human) wave quietly at you in the
gentle breeze.  Above you, a solitary hawk circles, a barely recognizable
dot in the intense blue sky.

Grasslands Road~
You travel on a hard packed dirt road through vast prairies and meadows. 
The area around you is dry, but to the east you can see hints of a sea of
green.  A vagrant breeze twines around you, refreshing you but also
stirring up motes of dust which tickle your nose and irritate your eyes. 
The cerulean sky is cloudless and remote, home olny to winged scavengers
flying in solitary circles.

Grasslands Road~
The road travels east to west through a varied landscape.  At this point
in the road the surrounding area has become completely arid.  Small scrub
bushes and prairie grass completely cover the area, and are slowly
enraoching on the area the road occupies.  The drab green of the
vegetation is the only color besides the bright blue sky.

Grasslands Road~
The road crosses the plain from east to west, cutting a path through the
weedy bushes that dominate the landscape.  The aridity of the region is
evident as each stop you take brings up puffs of dust that rise to your
knees, then settle down again to the path.  The wind gusts in random
movements, occasionally stirring up a dust devil that dances for a short
while before collapsing in a tan pile on the road.

The grasses rustle quietly under your feet and at your passing.  The long

propels the vegetation about you.  The prairie roams with other, mobile
life, audible in soft squeaks and sudden rustles in the deep parts of the
layers of grass.

Burned Manor~
At some time in the past this residence was the site of a great fire. 
The interior of the house in nothing more than a mass of charred wooden
beams and planks.  The staircase to the upper levels of the home has
collapsed in the years since the fire.  Blackened shards of glass from
the windows are scattered about the entire floor.  Looking closely at the
back corner of the building you see an area of the floor that has been
burned completely through.
~
Need an action so when players leave down they get
"You enter the black hole and descend to the cellar."

You are walking along a cobblestone path.  As you go farther down the

unnatural way.  An almost malevolent presence can be felt watching you
from the forest.  A chill passes through your body and the hair on the
nape of your neck stands straight up.  You think you should continue down
the path as quickly as possible.

Assuming I'm walking south down the path?  What if I'm walking north?

#36319
Atop Narrow Peak~
The view from up here is breathtaking.  Hills spread out in every
direction, flattening out to a grassy plain far to the west.  At the
limit of vision to the east, trees rise above the hills.  It is a perch
well-suited to meaningful contemplation, or suicide.  All in all, well
worth the climb.

Save~
Luckily, you catch yourself before much harm is done.
~
E
OtherFails~
$n slips and slides over the edge of the cliff in an undignified manner.
~
E
Fail~
Your attempt fails, and you slide over the edge in a flurry of
flailing limbs.
~
E
NoRoom~
It looks as if there is already someone down there, and no room for a
second.
