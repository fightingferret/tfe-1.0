Beneath the Stone Bier~
A narrow shaft descends from a hole at the top of this narrow, vertical
cavern.  Formed from limestone, the passageway is rough, as if it has been
dug through.  Large divots of stone have been carved out of the limestone
cavern, providing handholds for climbing.  The walls of the shaft are
painted with the images of wolves and eagles.
~
*I appreciate what eveyone thinks I liked - going back to divots.

Inside an Old Cavern Complex~
This appears to be the beginning of a large series of caverns.  Directly
to the north is a tall, domed cavern with passages branching off of it. 
Above your head, a shaft has been dug through the limestone and continues
upward into darkness.  Chunks of limestone have been gouged out of the
side of the shaft, providing more than adequate handholds for the ascent.

Domed Cavern~
Nearly perfectly circular, this cavern is very wide and tall.  Some fifty
feet above the smooth floor of the limestone cavern is a graceful, domed
ceiling.  Hanging down from the center of the dome is a single stalactite. 
Four passages of limestone, hollowed out naturally, branch off from the
cavern in the cardinal directions.  Directly to the north, the gleam of
gold catches your eye.

Near a Golden Stalagmite~
Rising from the ground and nearly filling the cavern is a tall, golden
stalagmite.  Formed from brilliant yellow, almost gold limestone, the
dripstone formation comes within a few feet of touching the cavern's
smooth, pale grey ceiling.  The cavern continues around the golden spire
to the north and south.

Circular Cavern~
Roughly circular, this cavern is very large.  Some thirty feet above your
feet the ceiling stands, with a few slim stalactites dripping off of it. 
Four passages of limestone, hollowed out naturally and smoothly, branch
off from the cavern in the cardinal directions.  Directly to the south

This little cavern has a high ceiling and an extremely level floor. 
Neither stalactites nor stalagmites mar the perfect smoothness of the
cavern's ceiling or floor.  Protruding from the northern, back wall of
the limestone chamber is a small font with the visage of a lion's
face.  To the south, the cavern branches outward in several directions.

Before a Yawning Chasm~
A large, cavernous passage extends from the west to the east.  However, a
yawning chasm stretches across the entire cavern from north to south,
preventing travel to the west.  A single spiraling stalactite hangs from
the ceiling of the passage, directly over the center of the chasm.

Slanted Cavern~
This broad cavern slants slightly to the south at a downward angle. 
While the limestone walls are slightly rough, the floor is extremely
smooth.  It is as if the floor has been polished or worn down by an
abundance of traffic, yet you can see little other evidence of this.  The
cavern continues to the south and east.  Also, along the northern part of
the cavern is a giant slab of stone.  Beside it, set into the limestone,
is a depression shaped like a hand print.

Long, Sloping Cavern~
From your current position, you can see that the limestone cavern twists
to the east directly to the north.  It also extends far to the south, so
far that you cannot see its end from here.  The cavern's smooth, pale
grey floor slopes at a downward angle to the south.  Thick, heavy dust
coats the floor.

Small, Cavern Pool~
This small cavern has two branches leading off from it.  The branch which
leads west adjoins a cavern overgrown with fungus while the passage north
has a definite incline in the same direction.  Towards the back fo the
chamber is a small, dark pool of water whose depths spill out and cover
much of the floor.

[Merior] the second sentence sounds wrong - north slants upward in that direction?

[Merior] look pool uses object, not room
not my fault gc messed it up. acode to replace
[Calliope] Why can you go west here, and not east from the other side? Wouldn't fungus block both directions?
Same reason you push a barbed arrow through versus pulling it out of a wound.
*mostly just to piss people off and go around, but escially because its
easier to push through this way than the other.

Slanted Cavern~
This broad cavern slants slightly to the south at a upward angle.  While
the limestone walls are smooth, the floor is extremely rough.  It seems
as if this portion of the caverns has received very little traffic.  The
cavern continues to the south and west.  Also, along the northern part of
the cavern is a giant slab of stone.  Beside it, set into the limestone,
is a depression shaped like a hand print.

Long, Low Cavern~
The cavern's ceiling remains low until just a few feet before it reaches
a dead end to the south.  The ceiling then rises a little, to a
comfortable level.  Near where the ceiling gets taller, the cavern
passage branches to the west and east, into smaller caves.  The limestone
passageway continues out of sight to the north.

Cavern Tomb~
This cavern's north and south walls are very close together while the
other walls are far apart and very spacious.  A cave-in looks to have
occurred along the western part of the limestone chamber for piles of
rubble lie against it.  Painted upon the cavern's pale grey walls are
pictures of fierce, feminine wolves.  The wolves seem to be gazing upon
the long stone bier resting at the heart of the narrow cavern.

A large amount of rubble lies against the west wall.  Though it appears

painting wolves feminine~
Upon the walls, fierce female wolves have been painted.  Most of the
she-wolfs stare at the stone bier resting in the cavern, as though
guarding it.

Tomb with Wall Paintings~
The remains of a partial cave-in lie to the east, cluttering the small
cavern's only entrance and exit.  Stalactites barely a foot long hang
from the ceiling, poised directly above the long stone bier resting at
the cavern's center.  Painted upon the smooth, pale grey walls are small
paw prints.
~
||move mound east||
[Merior] can east close? if so, room can be wrong
*it says clutering, doesnt say sealing off.  It doesnt say either fully. 
added leaving message to clarify.
[Merior] if token doesnt always pop - should it be in her description?
*nod, yeah, i think it should. see mirror wrong for argument :)
[Merior] is stone just treasure?
no, its a replacenet for low-level rbacers or equal gem bracers
[Merior] generally 'big' mobs are more then 2 levels higher then little ones
*um, yeah, so?  general zones follow the chief/shaman/cook/gaurd/warrior
pattern too which is not exactly original. The mobs are 20% higher than their guards :p...

Cavern Tomb~
The entrance to this cavern is little more than a gap in the western wall. 
Within, you can see a series of horses painted upon the wall.  Formed
from limestone, the cavern's surfaces are smooth and dry.  There is very
little within the chamber, save for a long bier of grey stone.
