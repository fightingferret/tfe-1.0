Entrance to the Abandoned Mine~
Before you stands the entrance to an old abandoned mine.  It is very dark
inside so you can only see a few feet into the tunnel.  A cold wind blows
out from the tunnel sending shivers up your spine.  To the south, stone
blocks stand piled against a large stone wall.  Looking more carefully,
you can see the small seam of a door behind the stones.

The Abandoned Mine~
The tunnel is fairly large here.  Huge wooden beams line the ceiling and
walls to prevent cave-ins.  However, the beams look old.  Off in the
distance, you can hear the rocks shift ever so slightly.  Looking north
and south, you see only darkness.

The Abandoned Mine~
As you make your way, you notice the large amounts of rock that lie
crumbled on the floor.  Obviously there was a large excavation here at
one time.  What could they have been digging for?  Jagged rocks stick out
occasionally from the walls in the tunnel which continues to the north
and south.  A cold wind continues to blow from deep within the mine.  A
smaller tunnel leads off to the east.

You continue your way through the mine.  Rugged holes lie in the walls

tunnel to the north and south.  This mine must have been built long ago.

A Four-Way Intersection~
You have reached an intersection in the mine.  Deep grooves are on the 
ground in front of you as if someone, possibly miners, have worn out the
ground carrying supplies and rock to and from whatever destination they
may have found deep within the earth.  Tilting your head, you can pick up
the sound of digging somewhere within the reaches of these tunnels.  The
tunnels branch off in each of the cardinal directions.

Maya, start here and work your way west, some rooms have been started and
such...feel free to alter them - D 
Just try and make sure that each room has at least four lines of

Despite the coolness of the rocks which crowd around you, you can feel a
small bead of sweat begin on your forehead.  The tiny crevice extends
into extreme darkness to the west, and descends to the east.  You can

of Medienne.  Thick brambles and thorn bushes crowd each other and the
path, growing at the feet of mighty pines along the sides of the path.

Forest Trail~
The path here becomes somewhat damp and muddy, showing the footprints of
those that have traveled before you.  Lush and leafy ferns grow right up
to the edge of the path, their curled fronds swaying in the breeze.  The
tall pines are covered with thorny vines which climb the trunks and hang
from the lower branches.  The trail curves north and east, snaking its
way through the trees.

Forest Trail~
The dirt trail winds through the dense pine forest, heading west and
south.  Deep wagon wheel ruts mar the surface of the road, making foot
travel difficult.  A thick tangle of brambles encroaches upon the trail,
crawling up the trunks of the pines and making movement off the trail
something to avoid.  The occasional bird call shatters the silent forest.

Hidden Shrine~
A small ring of stones is arranged in this clearing beneath the pines. 
Within the ring are several mushrooms and a small bowl-shaped depression. 
A circle of trimmed hedges rings the small clearing, creating a space
that is at once private and serene.  The branches of the pines form an
arched canopy above the clearing, further insulating you from the rest of 
the world.
~
Acode here transports all in room to faerie ring by Kha-da.
[Marek] Acode requires a quest item, a rare plant, and a few common items. 
Also, acode resets the room, so it can't be used constantly.
Clues to the items required are only found after casting ID on the tome,
as well.

Forest Trail~
Towering pines lean over the dirt trail that turns to the south and to
the east here.  Large ferns grow amongst the brambles and thorny vines at
the foot of the pines.  Through the tangled branches above you can catch
a glimpse of the sky.  The air smells sweet, perhaps scented by the small
flowers that grow beneath the brambles.

Grassy Knoll~
Short but lush grass covers the sloping hillside meadow in a carpet of
green.  A faint trail cuts through the grass heading up the slope towards
the west, perhaps an old animal track.  To the east and north a thick
canopy of pine trees grow close together.  The meadow spreads out to the
south, small wildflowers dotting the hillside.

Grassy Knoll - Overlooking Deep Chasm~
The gentle slope of the grassy knoll heads upwards towards the northwest. 
To the south a large chasm opens up, sharp rocks and bleached bones
dotting the bottom.  Just beyond the chasm, a high wall rises, a sturdy
defense against attack.  The meadow continues to the west and north.

You see all type of flowers off the north side of the trail.  The smell
of all the wildflowers here is so strong, it's hard to discern one kind
from another.  Off to the east, you see a faint trail that disappears
into the huge trees which swallow it from sight.

To the east, you notice a gentle slope in the trail that drops down a bit
before continuing to the east.  The trees that border this path on the
north and the south side are huge and almost foreboding.  The trail also
continues to the west up a gentle slope.

The trail seems to tunnel into the trees that continue surrounding it on
the north and south sides here.  You notice that the stones on the ground
here are all flat and smooth as if this once was an old river bed.  You
see some old broken shells on the ground here.  To the east and west, the
trail slopes gently up in either direction.

river bed~
This bed must be as old as time itself and hasn't seen water in its
bottom for many years.  Shells and stones cover its bottom in a thick
covering.  It looks safe to cross.

Most of the shells appear to be broken and contain jagged edges and
rather useless.

3 stones~
These stones appear to be small, round and smooth as only many, many

You try to look up at the sky to get a bearing on your whereabouts, only
to find a thick canopy of tree limbs high above you.  However, you do
notice that the trail continues to wind through the forest, curving to
the south and west, where the ground gently slopes down.  You hear the
sounds of birds off in the distance.  The sound is somewhat soothing.

Thick, lush and green is its almost umbrella like shape.  In fact, it

As you walk along the trail, you notice small animal tracks in the dirt. 
You try and follow them with your eyes until they fade from view to the
south into the thick brush.  The trail continues to the north and east
through the towering trees.

animal tracks~
Looking closer at the tracks, they seem to be made by rabbits.  As you
look closer, you notice some wolf tracks as well.  It would seem the wolf
chased the rabbit off to the south.  You wonder to yourself whether it
caught it or not.

To the east, a massive tree has fallen across the path, blocking further
passage.  You could have sworn you saw an animal scurry into a hole in
the log, but you aren't quite sure.  The trail extends to the west from
here, and a makeshift trail skirts the log to the north.  A leaf-covered
ravine is visible to the south, but is probably too steep to climb down.

must have fallen long ago, because all that remains is a hollowed-out log. 
The end of the log is covered with scratch marks, and you could swear you
heard noises from inside.  A rudimentary trail curves away to the south.

The trail continues to wind through the massive trees, which seem to
stretch as far as the eye can see in every direction.  Above you, a thick
canopy of limbs and leaves make it impossible for you to see the sky.

which winds to the east and west.

Trail Around Medienne~
Twisting and turning sharply around the pine trees, the path meanders
beneath the scented boughs of the trees.  Occasional blocks of stone
litter the ground, peaking out from beneath thorn vines and piles of
rotting pine needles.  You spot occasional movement beneath the thick
brambles, most likely squirrels or some other small creatures.  You can
follow the path west or south.

Trail Around Medienne~
The path comes up to the base of a mighty stone wall once again. 
Occasional pine trees dot the area, but thick tangles of brambles cover
the sloping hill northeast of the path.  The thorns grow thick over the
boulders and stones that dot the hillside.  You can follow the path north
and east.

Slipping between a tall stone wall on the west, and a steep, thorn-
tangled hillside on the east, the trail provides the only means of
movement through the area.  Warm air rolls off the hillside to the east,
causing small dust devils to swirl along the path.  The path leads west
and south.
