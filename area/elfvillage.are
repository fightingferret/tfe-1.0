A Quiet Row of Trees~
A row of trees have been recently planted here, filling what used to be a
small clearing in the forest.  Small birds' nests rest gingerly amidst
the branches of the young trees, giving the row the feeling of fresh
life, of rebirth.  The old forest spreads out to the west and north,
while to the east and south you can see more recently-planted trees.

A Quiet Row of Trees~
A row of trees have been recently planted here, filling what used to be a
small clearing in the forest.  You can see two huts to the north, one is
small and directly to the north, while the other is larger and off to the
northeast.  The row of trees continues to the west, while to the east you
can see another hut across a small section of grass.

Near a Gentle Forest Stream~
A small clear stream trickles its way through the forest about a score or
so yards to the west.  Thick ferns and bushes to the south block the way
in that direction, but the vast expanse of the forest is sure to provide
enough adventure in all other directions.  A row of trees have recently
been planted in what was once a clearing to the east.

Near a Gentle Forest Stream~
The forest thins as it nears a small stream to the northwest.  The stream
bends away to the west, trickling off into the forest beyond.  A quiet

To the east you can see the thatched wall of a hut.

West of a Gentle Forest Stream~
The trees around you are flanked by ferns and small shrubs.  A stream
bubbles by to the east, carrying its crystal clear water through the
forest as its lifeblood.  A faint trail winds its way through the forest
to the south.  The way is easy to the east and south, while to the north
and west the foliage is simply too thick to be passed through.

On the Shore of a Gentle Forest Stream~
A small stream of cool water trickles by to the north, bending away to
the southwest.  While not wide or deep, the far bank of the stream is
steep and tall, and slick with water, and so keeps the stream from being
crossed.  You can follow the stream to the south and east.

By Two Small Huts Near a Gentle Stream~
Two huts, one to the east and one to the south, share this small patch of
light grass near a gentle stream as their doorstep.  The stream is
flowing roughly east and west, and while not shallow or wide, the far
bank rises into a sheer face about ten feet high, and slick with water,
making crossing the stream an impossibility.  You can follow the stream
to the west.

somewhat of a sitting room as well.  Windows on the east and south wall
give a view of the surrounding forest.

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
A thatch hut to the southwest cradles this corner of the clearing.  Off
to the northeast you can see a large thatch hall across the clearing.  In
the distance beyond the huts you can see the mighty trees of the Vaasa
creating their impenetrable canopy high overhead.

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
The clearing spreads off to the southeast away from the walls of a large
hall to the north and a small hut to the west, both made of thatch.  The
trickling of a stream is easily heard nearby.  The short grass of the
clearing is wide-bladed and green, dotted with the occasional weed or
wildflower.

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
A small clearing spreads in all directions save to the north, where the
wall of a large thatch hall rises overhead.  You can see three other
thatch buildings, all small huts, two to the west and another to the
southeast.

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
This small grass clearing seperates the walls of the small thatch huts
that surround it.  Tall weeds grow knee-high suggesting that no one has
maintained the area in some time.  Tall trees overhang the clearing
creating a shadey spot to rest a bit.  To the west lie a pair of small
thatch huts, while to the north a large thatch hall rises up.

A Small Clearing in the Forest~
A faint trail leads east, then north around the edge of a large thatch
hall to the north.  The clearing stretches out to the southwest, ringed
by several small huts.  A small plaque is embedded into a large rock
which has been brought here from the nearby mountains.  It has something
engraved on it which may bear further inspection.

Inside a Small Hut~
This is the entrance room of this small hut, with open doorways leading
south and east into other rooms.  A small wooden door leads west and out
of the hut.  The sparse room bears no decorations whatsoever; perhaps the
hut's owners favor function over form when it comes to their living areas.

Inside a Small Hut~
This small hut bears little furniture, except for a small table in the
center of the room.  The thatch walls and ceiling are covered with small
holes allowing small amounts of light to illuminate the room.  The air in
here is dense with moisture and the ever present smell of wet thatch.  To
the north and west lie open doorways leading into different sections of
the hut.

A Bedroom Inside a Small Hut~
This room obviously serves as a bedroom, as a neatly-made bed rests in
the corner of the hut.  A large padded mat stretches across the floor,
probably a comfortable place to rest as well.  An open doorway to the
south leads to another room of the hut, while a wooden ladder leads up to
a small loft.

A Small Loft~
This small loft overhangs a larger room in this small thatch hut.  A
small bed sits in the corner, and a wooden ladder leads down into the hut. 
A few splotches of colour decorate the walls in a seemingly random
pattern.  You spot something shiny in the corner of the room.

splotches colour walls patter~
It looks as if paint was splattered on the thatch walls, or perhaps some
kind of dye.  In any case in a few places you can also see some marks of
abrasion as the paint was forcefully removed.

You search the darkness of the corner for a bit, but don't find anything. 
Perhaps it was just a trick of reflecting light which misled you.

A Small Trail Near a Large Thatch Hall~
A gentle forest stream trickles by to the northeast, with a far bank so
steep and slick that crossing it is an impossiblity.  A faint trail leads
north to the door of a large thatch hut, while to the west a large
clearing spreads out between an assortment of huts.  Across the stream,
the mighty trees of the Vaasa spread out past the range of your vision.

Before a Large Thatch Hall~
A stream with an extremely steep far bank trickles by to the north and
bends to the south as you follow it to the east.  A small wooden door
leads into a large hall made of thatch to the west.  A faint trail leads
into a clearing to the south.  Across the stream you can see the mighty
trees of the Vaasa as the forest spreads out, seemingly to the ends of
the realms.

East End of a Large Thatch Hall~
This rather large hall is made of thatch, but seems rather stable for
such a large structure.  To the west, a long table dominates the hall and
marks it as a meeting place of sorts.  A small wooden door to the east
leads outside.

Inside a Large Thatch Hall~
A long table stretches east and west within this large thatch hall,
flanked by benches on either side.  To the west and the east,
respectively, are the head and foot of the table.  The thatch of the hut
is reinforced with thin saplings, or perhaps long, thin tree branches,
allowing it to seem fairly sturdy and durable.

West End of a Large Thatch Hall~
This is the far west end of a large hall made of thatch.  The thin wooden
supports give the hall some stability, allowing it to reach a fairly
large size despite the poor structural qualities of thatch.  To the east
you can see a long table flanked by two benches, while at this end of the
table is set a cushioned chair in a place of honor at the head of the
table.

A Bedroom Inside a Small Hut~
This small room is obviously used as a bedroom, as a large bed rests in
the corner.  However a small padded bench and a desk mark it as possibly
room used for other purposes as well.  An open doorway to the north leads
to another room in the thatch hut.
