Old Mountain Road~
The Old Mountain Road traverses a steep slope here, its narrow path
leading up toward a wider area in the mountains.  To the south, it
continues downward, while to the east and west steep slabs of rock rise
up, far overhead.

#42251
Old Mountain Road~
The narrow old road picks its way between towering peaks, leading up a
slope to the north and down to the west.  A great rock wall rises up,
nearly vertical, to the east, too steep to climb.  Looking south, you are
able to glance between the peaks and spy the forested slopes and open
meadows far below you, their bright green and yellow colors strident in
contrast to the dull grey and rough textures of the nearby terrain.

Old Mountain Road~
The road slopes upwards to the east here, and down towards a lower region
of the mountain range to the west.  Rock walls rise up around you to the
north and south, with those in the former direction reaching dizzying
heights, their bare peaks capped with patches of snow, ice, and, you
might guess, the remains of those foolish enough to venture there.

Old Mountain Road~
The old road cuts its way through the Cairn Mountains, leading east and
west.  On either side of the narrow stone byway, huge cliffs of rock rise
far overhead, their steep slopes nearly bereft of vegetation, save for a
few scrawny bushes and the odd tuft of pale grass.

Old Mountain Road~
The road leads east and down here, snaking its way along a narrow, steep
ridge in the Cairn Mountains.  Directly north of here, a steep cliff
towers overhead, its face strangely smooth and made out of an
uncharacteristic dark rock.

great Obelisk, one of the strange markers scattered about this region.

#42256
The Broken Obelisk~
Three roads meet one another at a point in the Cairn Mountains, and this
is that point.  A single great stone stands at the point of convergence,
its great mass reaching the height of perhaps a half-dozen dwarves, its
mass totaling that of scores more.  To the south, the crumbled stones of
the Old Forest Road lead down a steep incline, while roads also lead
north and west, further into the rough terrain.

Old Forest Road~
You stand in the middle of the famed Old Forest Road, just above where it
leaves the lower reaches of the Cairn Mountains for the Old Forest proper. 
All about you, trees vie with steep, rocky inclines for space, sometimes
scant feet from the edges of the ancient, yet somehow level, road.  To
the north, you see a small intersection as the road leads further up a
slope and into the mountains.

Old Forest Road~
A sheer rock wall runs north to east here, its stony presence a clear
indication that you have reached the edge of the great Cairn Mountains. 
The trees cling to the steep, rocky soil and grow along the edges of the
great road as it begins its climb in earnest.  To the south, the road
leads into forestland.

Old Forest Road~
The ancient road winds its way between the roots and impassive trunks of
the surrounding forest, their great arching branches supporting a dense
canopy which reaches over the ruined road.  To the north, the road climbs
yet another slope as it continues its ascent toward the Cairn Mountains. 
To the west, the road disappears into the woods.  The trees lining the
road appear to be mostly evergreens and deciduous, but beyond the
treeline a forest bed of pine needles is visible as the forest becomes
increasingly coniferous.

Old Forest Road~
The road steepens here, turning east and south to avoid what appears to
be the rocky foothills of the Cairn Mountains.  Elsewhere, trees grow
along the edges of the road, their long dark branches reaching overhead
in an eerie attempt to block out what little of the sky you can perceive
from your vantage point on the road.  The edges of the forest appear to
be mostly evergreens and deciduous trees, but beyond the treelines you
can see a forest bed of pine needles as the trees become increasingly
coniferous.

Old Forest Road~
The road passes through forest here, making its course in a straight line
even as rows of trees seem to line up against the overgrown margins of
the road.  Sloping steadily upwards to the north, you spy the great
craggy Cairn Mountains looming far above you in the distance, while the
road leads south and further into the forest.  The edges of the forest
around you seems to be mostly evergreens and deciduous trees, but beyond
that treeline a forest bed of pine needles can be seen as the forest
becomes increasingly coniferous.

Old Forest Road~
The road, with its worn stones and small surveryor's markers, proceeds
north and south through woodland.  Lining the road, the trees are not
particularly tall, but nonetheless seem old, a relic perhaps of a bygone
age or clime.  To the north, the ground seems to slope upward several
gentle, successive stages.

Old Forest Road~
The road leads north and south through quiet, still woodland.  While the
trees are not particularly great in stature or girth, you sense an age, a
dull, forgotten memory and mute sadness about them, as if they stand as a
monument to some past folly, forgotten by the entire world, save them. 
To the west, you spy a small grove.

Old Forest Road~
The trees around you stand silent, their mute forms looming over you and
shielding the damp earth and cracked stone underfoot from the sky
overhead.  The ancient road leads north and west here, and you think you
spy a small grove off to the northwest.  The end of a gorge is visible to
the east, a deep trench which winds its way to the northeast.  A faint
trail leads along the south edge of the gorge to the east, into a forest
of mighty pines.

You stand in a small forest grove, shaded from the sky by a tight cluster

vegetation.  The air is cool and still about you, and a small @bspring@n of
cool water bubbles up from the ground, between a small rock and the
gnarled root of a great oak.

An old road branches off from the Mountain Road, the elder byway more
narrow and less straight than its successor.  Famous for its years of use
as a vital link between cities and as a commercial route, its perilous
path and changes lost over the course of history have lead to its
obsolescence.  The ground falls away south, into a gap between peaks in
the Cairn Mountains.

the road meets the Northern Sea Trail, and every so often a strong gust
of sea air rushes into your lungs from the south.

The old forest road was one an important connection between mountainous
areas and coast.  For various reasons, to be developed, it has become
dangerous and is little-used.  Heading in from the cliffs here and going
north, it enters some low brush and trees.  Then comes into open area
where a forest once grew (thick forest once, thus the name) but now is
open area, meadows and low scrub.  Thickens into forest after a bit, then
forest becomes rocky as ground rises and leads into rough mountains (old
mountain road) (Need to get road described, and from their, expand
outward along sides to make some decent terrain 'enclaves')

Old Forest Road~
The road leads through the weatherworn brush.  You have heard stories
about this area, of groaning spirits, of long dead warriors, and of
travelers vanished in the night.  Stray too far from the worn stones
which even now seem to wince with each footfall, and perhaps you might
join them among the disappeared.

Old Forest Road~
The ground dips slightly here, and a stand of unusually straight trees
grows along the southern margin of the road.  The trees still do not
quite constitute a forest, and you think they begin to thin out up the
gradual slope to the west of here.  The old road continues east and west.

Old Forest Road~
A stand of trees abuts the road to the south, as it rises slowly from
east to west.  The trees here grow somewhat less crooked, as you move
away from the ocean and its oppressive breeze.  The road winds through
the scattered trees and brush, leading north and east.

Old Forest Road~
The trees on either side of the road are less and less twisted, but seem
to be thinning out.  Thick grasses grow along the edge of the road, and
the roadstones underfoot are cracked and worn.  The stately byway
continues north and south.

A steep embankment rises up along the eastern side of the road here.  The
trees grow in a few small but surprisingly dense thickets in that
direction, while off to the west the terrain seems to open up.  You may
head south or follow the Old Forest Road west and out into the open and
what is no longer forest.

You step away from the concealment offered by the scattered banks of
trees and stand on the remains of the Old Forest Road, underneath a grand
and open sky.  To the west, you spy open terrain and grasslands, marked
with a few stands of insistent trees and brush.

The road skirts a slight brush-covered slope to the east.  A few stands
of trees grow behind the roadside bushes, but clearly the surrounding
terrain is barren even though it may have once been a great forest.  The
road continues north and south.

The ground rises somewhat to the north here, the old road taking an
uneven line up the slope.  The growth along the eastern edge of the trail
is quite thick here, and a few bushes on the western side of the trail
grow around the base of a large rock.

Despite a small copse of elms, oaks and the occasional walnut tree along
the eastern side of the road, the opposite side of the road is open
scrubland.  The worn stones lead east and south from here.

open scrubland and the occasional stand of brush spreads out from the
roadside.  Though this area was once known for its great forest, little
remains, for what reason you do not know.

@gSuddenly, to the north, you notice some nasty vines along the western
side of the road and instinctly shiver.  Sharp tendrils look ready to
ensnare you.  It'd probably be a good idea to avoid that side of the
road, as you head north.@n

The old road winds its way across a rocky slope covered with scrub bushes. 
To the southeast, a small copse breaks up the horizon, while to the west
little aside from the familiar low, thorny bushes to which you have grow
all too familiar with is present to break up the visual monotony.  The
road curves to the east, and to the north begins a brush-infested tangle.

Leading east and west across a gentle, scrub-laden slope, the road makes
its way in a sure manner, despite the clumps of weeds and grass which
signal its age and lack of use by travelers in the present day.  Off to
the south, you see a small copse, but aside from that few trees grow
nearby.
