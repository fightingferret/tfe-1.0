At the Mouth of a Vast Desert~
To the east twist the corridors of an enormous canyon littered with sand. 
The climate here is hot and dry and the land appears extremely barren. 
Only the occasional swirl of dust breaks the monotony of the dry
landscape.  A single section of the merciless desert expands to the south
down through the twisting canyon.  You can see waves of heat visibly
rising up from the desert sands continuously.

Sand-Filled Canyon~
While the bottom of this canyon is filled with sand, it appears that such
was not always the case.  Piles of sands have been swept into the region,
half-burying a few plants around them.  It is as though a giant wind
storm has filled the twisting canyon with sand.  The air here is
oppressively hot, making it difficult to breathe.  As the canyon walls
twist and turn like one of the tunnels in a rabbit's warren from east to
west, the land between them becomes increasingly more barren.

E
twisting canyon walls~
To the north and south loom two walls of sandstone which twist about on
an east-west course.  These canyon walls seem to serve as natural
barriers, keeping the sand within trapped.  The sandstone walls are much
too steep to climb, and doing so might prove more dangerous than it is
worth.  Rocks and boulders perch along the edge of the canyon walls and
look capable of falling at any moment.
~
E
sand~
The sand which fills the bottom of the canyon is so deep that you cannot
feel the hard impact of the true ground below.  Tan in color, the sand
seems remarkably smooth.  Much of the sand has come to gather in small
dunes.
~
E
half-bury few plants~
Up to their stems in sand, a few patches of hardy wild flowers grow here
and there along the canyon floor.  Judging from how green their stems are
and how healthy their petals appear, it strikes you as unusual that the
flowers would be doing so well, if the canyon had always been filled with
sand.

Inside a Spiraling Tower of Sand~
The interior of the column of spiraling sand is actually part of a
slender tower which extends upwards, into the spire of the sandy pillar. 
The floor consists of hard, packed sand and the walls of the tower are
molded from black sand and coated with clear resins.  A simple mat of
woven grass lies on the floor and next to it there is a fat, tapered
candle and a pile of sand about five feet wide.  While there appears to
be at least a second story to this odd tower, there is no way of reaching
it.  In front of a door-shaped depression in the wall is a straight row
of pebbles.

ladder~
Once you concentrate upon the room, you can easily see the ladder which
leads to the second story of the tower.  The ladder is made of dried
reeds bound together with strips of hide.
~
E
simple mat woven~
Woven from alternating colors of green and brown, a medium-sized round
rug lies in the center of the room.  The alternating colors of grass have
been braided around a spiraling pattern that is half-hypnotic.
~
E
fat tapered candle~
Poured from melted animal fat, this odorous yellow candle is about a foot
thick at its base and stands more than four feet tall.  As it rises from
its iron cauldron holder, the candle twists and tapers to a fine point.
~
E
pile sand~
Beside the round, woven mat of grass rests a pile of sand.  The sand has
multiple depressions in it, as though something had been resting on it. 
Flakes of chitin lie on the surface of the sandy pile.
~
E
walls black~
Rather than being sculpted from red sand like most other structures here,
the walls of the spiral tower are lined with black sand and covered with
hardening resins.  The black sand is not indigenous to this region of
desert and hard toils must have been underwent to bring such a great
amount of it to this tower.
~
E
floor~
The floor of the tower consists of hard packed, red sand.  Except for the
pile of sand which lies next to the rug, the floor has been swept clean.
~
E
door-like space depression~
The depression in the northern wall of the tower is about the size of a
door though there is no door there.  A row of pebbles lie in front of the
depression.

At the Top of the Tower~
As you gaze around in the upper part of the spiraling tower, the first
thing you notice is there floor.  There is not one!  Or at least, not a
visible one.  Like the illusions cast to protect the crabman village from
intrusion, it appears some magic has been cast on the floor, turning it
invisible.  A single table with an angular chair behind it rests on the
invisible floor, towards the back of the tower room.  Shelves made from
sand and coated with a thick, hardening resin stick out from the walls of
the tower.  On the shelves, there is a large collection of scrolls and
tomes which look remarkably well preserved for being in a desert climate.

E
ladder~
The ladder itself, once illusion is not masking it, looks quite ordinary. 
It has evenly spaced rungs that are durably fastened together to the
frame of the ladder.  Though a bit wider than most ladders, it looks like
it could easily support your weight.
~
E
scrolls~
A few of the scrolls resting atop the shelves are parcially open,
allowing you to catch a glimpse of their contents.  Universally, the
scrolls' contents are detailed pictograms.  No words to read, no
hieroglyphics to translate.  Just a bunch of pictures with crabmen in
them.  The great pyramid also figures into the scrollwork quite heavy as
well.  Browsing through all the scrolls would take a lifetime.
~
E
tomes~
Bound in red, blue, and green leather hide, many of the volumes look
extremely ancient and would probably fall apart at the slightest touch. 
Currently, you have no use of anything you might find in this library.
Browsing through all the tomes would take a lifetime.
~
E
shelves~
Sculpted from sand and layered with hardening resin, the shelves
themselves are an artistic creation.  They have filigree along the edges
and curls along the sides.  And they are still remarkably level and flat. 
A number of scrolls and tomes rest along the various shelves.
~
E
table~
The table which stands towards the back of the room has a relatively
small surface top.  It, like most of the furniture in this odd little
settlement, is sculpted from sand and coated with a resin to preserve its
shape.  Atop the table, there are several claw marks, which appear to be
little more than a crabman's nervous scrapings.
~
E
angular chair~
Much to wide for a normal person, this chair looks to have been made
especially for a crabman.  Sculpted from sand and coated with a hardening
resin, the chair as a slick look to it.

info1~
Upon the scroll, you find detailed information about a complex ritual of
summoning.  You see a diagram of nine standing stones, with a shadow of
the seven stone falling across the middle marker.  Though much of the
scroll is too old to read, you see mention of needing a cauldron,
spider's eye, and a horse's horn.
~
E
info2~
Upon the scroll is a drawing of the desert as it must have looked quite
some time ago.  You can see the great pyramid at its center, btu around
it are three obelisks.  The obelisks stand to the east, north, and south
of the great monument.  At the bottom of the scroll, there is a note:

@RThe eastern obelisk is liable to collapse at anytime.  The underground
water there is weakening its foundation.
~
E

You give the scroll a glance.  There doesn't appear to be anything here
you want to know about.
~
E
info3~
On the surface of an ebony scroll, you see a picture of a fairy creature,

chain.  The borders of the scroll are etched with chains of lightning.

An Underground Pool~
Hidden far below the blazing sands of the Naraki desert lies a large,
underground pool of water.  The clear, cool water covers the entire floor
of the non-descript cavern of limestone.  The air here is cool and crisp
and the faintest aroma of fresh herbs and spices hangs in the air. 
Around the eastern edge of the pool, there is a rich shore of black earth. 
Huge clumps of reeds grow along the shore, blocking out all but the sight
of the pool.  The center of the underground oasis bubbles and gurgles
from being fed by a further underground source of water.

E
pool~
Cool and refreshing, a pool of deep blue water stretches before you. 
While the center of its surface is broken by the upwelling of an

Great Desert~
Though dunes of sand rise every now and again across the desert plain,
for the most part, the land is flat and lifeless. With sand the
color of dried dung and nothing but wind, rock, and the occasional
corpse, the barren desert landscape leaves much to be desired.  Far to
the north, a large trail or road can be seen, bustling with traffic,
while to the west and east the desert sands spread out through the rocky
canyon.  Southward though, the presense of steep mounds of sand make
travel in that direction unlikely.

To the west and east, the vast Naraki desert continues, its tan sands
sweeping through the region between two craggy rock faces.  The rocky

and possibly too, by desert rains.  Any evidence suggesting that this
part of the Naraki desert has ever been anything but a desert has been
buried beneath the drifting sands.

Great Desert~
To the north, a large rocky cliff rises, merging with the craggy rocks to
the west, forming but a single section of a massive canyon wall.  The
wall twists and curves all throughout the desert, intent seemingly in
keeping the desert held within trapped forever between the dauntless hard
rock.  In all other directions, the desert branches out, its tan sands
kicking up now and again to form minor dust devils.

An almost sheer canyon wall runs along the northern edge of the desert,

The first figure is that of an overgrown cat, its muzzle raised in a

female.  The head of the statue is missing though.

The base of the female body statue is engraved with a series of
hieroglyphics which are impossible to translate.

megalith~
The gigantic megalith which stands far to the south has a pyramid shape
and practically gleams.  Its surface rock has been polished to a definite
smoothness.  Made of polished green limestone, it is quite possible that
the pyramid is the largest structure ever built.

A cairn of stones has been piled up to the south.  The stones look to be

Barren Wasteland~
A bleak, barren landscape stretches out in all directions but the west,
where the sands of the desert collide with a twisting canyon wall.  The
tall, impenetrable canyon barrier continues to wind its way through the
desert.  Somewhere to the south, a cairn of rocks has been hastily
stacked.

E
canyon barrier twisting wall~
Twisting through the desert, a steep, unclimbable canyon makes its way. 
The canyon wall turns abruptly in some places, and smoothly in others,
creating natural barriers.  Within the barriers sand both gathers in
dunes and hollows out into bowls.

Barren Wasteland~
The tan-colored sand sweeps as far as the eye can see, great mounds of
dunes to the north and east.  Between two such dunes is a crudely stacked
pile of rocks.  Here, the imposing rocky barrier which is the canyon
curves to the south, leaving only the north and east parts of the desert
traversable.  A few clumps of brown desert grass lay scattered about,
clinging to life in the arid land.

canyon rocks barrier stacks~
Though there are a few places where the sheer canyon walls may be
climbed, this is not one of them.  The canyon walls of the ancient sunken
valley sweep from the north and turn eastward, forming a slight niche.
~
E
grass clumps~
The clumps of desert grass grow in tiny patches strewn all throughout the
desert.  The patches of grass here are much too dry to offer any
sustenance for either beast or man.
~
E
niche~
Where the canyon rock formation corners, a small patch of desert has been
trapped.  This spot is both sheltered from the wind and the brunt of the
sun's deadly heat.  In the center of the patch of desert stands a cairn
of stacked rocks.
~
E
bones piles cairn~
Examining the cairn of stones, you notice that the crude pile of rocks is
little more than a few scattered rocks which partly cover and house the
remains of some humanoid creature whose flesh has long since disappeared
(or has been torn) from its bones. It is not apparent how the person
died, though most likely simple exposure was enough.
~
E
person skeleton remains~
The pile of skeletal remains are fairly recent.  Flakes of flesh and hair
still cling to the corpse in many places.  Also, much of the remains are
still bound and covered with clothing.  Tucked beneath a rock near a
clearly visible skeletal hand, there is a small satchel whose leather
surface is as weathed as the rocks piled atop it.
~
E
leather satchel~
From what you can see of the contents of the small leather satchel, it
appears that it was the carrier of this deceased adventure's supplies.  A
couple of torches, a tender box, and a thick candle jut out from its open
mouth.  The bag is clearly wedged in between the rocks and is not going
anywhere.

Barren Wasteland~
The tan-colored sand of the Naraki desert spreads ever onward through the
twisted, rocky canyon.  There are no visible signs of life in this part
of the merciless desert and even if there were, they would probably turn
out to be nothing but mere mirages.  Expanding out in all directions,
nothing mars the monotony of the flat, sandy terrain except a crudely
stacked cairn of stones off to the west.

Barren Wasteland~
Whether the heat, lack of water, or lack of food is the cause for this
desert's formation, it is evident that not much in the way of life has
lived within this area for some time - perhaps centuries.  The tan desert
sands are relatively flat and harbor only the occasional bush or patch of
scrub.  Off in the distance to the west, near the rocky canyon wall,
stands a landmark of sorts in this otherwise featureless and barren
desert.

Sand.  As far as the eye can see, there is only sand.  Sand, and the
occasional outcropping of rock which is part of the canyon.  Nature as
well as time seems to have forgotten about this expanse of barren terrain. 
The desolate land stretches out in all directions, with no more signs of
life in any of them.  The steep rocky walls of the canyon slope in from
the west and east, forming a narrow pass to the south, in the general
direction of a colossal stone creation.

A continual series of barchan sand dunes act as both a southern and

A Rocky Canyon~
The maniacally twisting walls of the canyon surround this portion of the
desert on nearly all sides.  It is only to the east that the desert
broadens into a wide, arid plain of nothingness.  A tall, weathered rock
whose apex comes to a sharp point stands in the middle of this dead-end
canyon, half-buried in sand.

Probably close to fifty feet tall, a weathered rock stands before you,
its surface worn down by the passing desert storms.  The rock has roughly

rocky sides come together and form a point at their apex.
~
E
apex~
As you glance up at the apex of the weathered rock, you can see that its
tip comes to a distinct point that no amount of weathering could possibly
form.  In fact, as you look up at it from a different angle, it dawns on
you that this is no ordinary rock but instead it is an obelisk.

Though much of the obelisk's surface has eroded, series of hieroglyphs
can barely be made out.

Many of the hieroglyphics are missing and worn away, but several remain. 
Out of those which remain, however, someone has taken great pains to
alter their original form, a fact heralded by an obvious effort to paint
over them with dark blue pigment.

The sands of the desert whip harshly against your skin as you are caught
in a momentary gust of violent wind, an occurrence not uncommon in the
arid wasteland.  The fingers of the desert outstretch fully to the south,
where massive sand dunes, too steep to climb, block passage in that
direction.  A giant whirlwind which has recently passed through this area
has partly uncovered something previously buried in the sand.

Fringed by a tall rocky cliff to the north and a series of massive dunes
to the south, the patch of desert here, little more than a hundred-yard
wide swath of arid land, proceeds west to east.  Not a single blade of

To the distant south rises a immense stone megalith, easily several

a barrier to the south.  Likewise, the sheer rock canyon cordons off the

in stark contrast to the precipitous barchans.  Between two of the

undulate in an endless, patternless wave.  Most of the dunes are too tall
to see over.  Even so, over the top of one of the shorter dunes, you can
see what appears to be a gigantic pyramid sheathed entirely in limestone.
~
E
gigantic pyramid~
The pyramid which stands to the south is extremely large.  Its surface is
that of pale green limestone that has no doubt been polished over time by
the abrassive desert sands.  Tracks of hieroglyphics have been etched
into the top of the pyramid, around its tip.  The hieroglyphics are
fairly distinct but too far away to read from here.

A Colossal Stone Structure~
Mounds of tan sand huddle against the side of the pyramid, obscuring most
of its crumbling base.  Deep gouges have been chiseled into the side of
the pyramid and do not look to be part of its original design.  A large
chunk of limestone, mostly covered in sand, lies in the dirt at your feet.

chunk limestone~
Once part of an even greater sheet of limestone sheathing, this piece of
limestone has been chiseled away from the base of the pyramid.  Its
surface is smooth and polished and there is no hint as to how the
limestone locked into place architecturally.  Along the top of the
pyramid, near the tip, are a few tracks of hieroglyphics.

E
gouges~
Deep gouges have been cut into the side of the pyramid.  From the
placement of the gouges, it looks as if whoever made them was looking for
a particular part of stone, testing it for something.  The gouges are
several inches deep into the structure.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
From east to west runs a narrow but long canyon barely more than thirty
feet wide.  Bound within its rocky walls, the hot, barren desert
threatens to overcome any who travel the arid landscape without proper
precautions.  Sparse tufts of brown desert grass dot the otherwise
featureless desert.  Although the grass seems to barely cling to
existence in most places, along the north canyon wall they grow quite
thick.

Tall grasses grow up all along the desert here.  Brown and green in

Tranquil Oasis~
Sheltered from the savage winds and blasting sands of the arid desert,
this oasis provides a brief haven from the blistering waves of heat
rising up off the land.  The work of deflation has created a basin within
the rocky canyon, where precious rainfall has collected in a crystal
clear pool of life-giving water.  Around the edges of the basin grow
several sturdy but old palm trees.  Tall desert grasses of a rich green
color nearly obscure the narrow passage into the desert canyon to the
south completely.

Squished between a tall canyon and a series of unusually large barchan

Nestled in the center of the rocky canyon, a massive pyramid taller than

The gigantic stone carvings, while quite detailed, mean absolutely

surface has been sheathed in limestone, which has become polished with
the passing of time.  The skills needed to build such a colossal
structure have likely been lost, at least for now.  Piles of debris lay
scattered about the base of the pyramid.

Along the base of the pyramid, piles of debris have collected.  Most of

Desert-Filled Canyon~
The eastern part of the canyon, which ran straight east and west,
branches off sharply to the north, where it diverges into a distinctly
different section of the desert.  The arid wilderness to the north is
composed not of tan sand, but of white and the dunes there are like small
hills rather than curving crescents.  Where the white and tan sands meet,
they do not mix.  Instead, it is as if an invisible barrier keeps the two
desert carefully separated.

Even though the canyon runs east and west for countless feet in either

turn northward, leading into a different type of desert.  The desert

steep barchan dunes, the white dunes to the far north resemble ant hills

Out of a series of seven or eight cliff carvings, only three remain even

a jewel.  In his hands he holds what appears to be a crude set of cutting
tools.  Within the second observable carving, a figure, wearing bulky
desert garb and her face hidden by scarves, runs through an expanse of
desert with spiral-shaped dunes.  In her hands she clutches a small gem
much like the one seen in the first carving.  Finally, in the last

obelisk there are rays, suggesting that the pyramidal tip of the monument

Even though the canyon runs east and west for countless feet in 
either direction, here, the rocky wonder chooses to turn northward, 
leading into a different type of desert. The desert sands to the north 
are the color of a snow hare's hide. Also, instead of steep barchan 
dunes, the white dunes to the far north resemble ant hills more than 
anything else.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
With a massive series of canyon cliffs to the north and a succession of
sheer tan sand dunes to the south, passage through this portion of the
desert is limited.  To the east, the desert 'corridor' created by dunes
and rock continues in a straight line path.  Further west, the canyon
corners abruptly to the south.  A pictograph, weathered and old, has been
carved into the face of the cliff.

The pictograph on the face of the cliff is worn and faded,  but what

head of a hunting cat.  Dressed in a regal gown, the woman's body is
turned to the left, towards a vast pyramidal structure.  Her head,
though, faces outward, towards you.  In the maw of the great feline,
there is a small jewel held in place by her wickedly-long teeth.

Desert-Filled Canyon~
The steep cliffs and walls composing the desert canyon end abruptly and
make a sharp turn to the south, where any one section of the arid terrain
looks quite like any other.  A single bush, the only exception to this,
stands about two feet in height to the immediate south.

Though your mind knows that the rock walls surrounding both you 
and the desert are just part of one gigantic canyon, your eyes find it 
nearly possible to believe. Here, the canyon walls create a sand-filled 
corridor which runs east to west and turns to the south.
~
E
cave~
Barely the height of a human, the small cave at the base of the western
canyon wall is partly filled with sand, although this probably was not
always the case.  In fact, considering the full fury of the sand storms
around here, you would not be surprised if this occurrence is recent. 
The edges of the cave's entrance have been smoothed by continuous
weathering.

A Single Bush~
Incredible. In the middle of the desert, bravely clinging on to life
stands a bush about two feet in height. The tough, green bush, unlike 
most of the wildlife, has apparently adapted to the desert climate and 
thrives. Around the base of the bush, there are a series of tracks, some 
small and some large, indicating that the desert itself is not the only 
thing to watch out for. Beyond the light green bush to the south 
stretches more of the endless seeming desert.

White Sand Desert~
Tall dunes of sand to the north mark a visible change in the white desert
sands.  Here, the sandy plain is relatively flat and unattractive.  Yet,
the mounds of desert earth to the north are perfectly formed, each with a
symmetric beauty like unto a sculptor's creation.  To the east there is
yet more arid land hidden beneath sand the color of pure white snow. 
Southward, the white sands of the desert merge and yet do not intermingle
with the tan sands which fill the area within the main desert canyon.

dunes~
Mounds of white sand stand majestically to the north like wolves watching

relatively flat desert terrain here.
~
E
main canyon~
Once the keeper of an ancient, sunken valley, the twisting canyon now
serves the purpose of sheltering the Southern Narak Desert from outside
contact.  To the south, the white desert, an anomaly within the southern
Narak, ceases as this portion of the canyon merges with the main section
of twisting canyon walls.
~
E
rocky cliffs~
High atop the valley walls there are flat overhangs of rock.  These
cliffs, which surround all the Southern Narak Desert, are quite numerous
but also, unfortunately, quite sheer.  There is no way to climb up to the
cliff, from here.
~
E
tan sands~
Though not much cooler than the white sands here, the tan sands of the
main Southern Narak Desert are a welcome change from the blinding white
of the northern dunes.

White Sand Desert~
Filled with white sand, this small desert lies within a part
of the rocky canyon which is all but cut off from a much larger canyon
wall.  Oddly, where the white and tan sands of the two different deserts
join, the sands mingle but little as though a line were clearly drawn
between them.  The floor of the white desert seems a bit cooler than the
other parts of the desert, where waves of heat visibly rise.

Unlike the tan sands which fill the majority of the great canyon

Sands the color of dead leaves stretches out in a plain of barren waste
to the south.  A welcome change from the dung-colored sands, the sands of
white which lie to the north are quite different, if not extremely bright.
~
E
sands~
The sands here are both white and tan.  It is as though each were a
separate entity all its own.  Exactly where the tan desert ends and the
white desert begins is unquestionable, for the sands, remarkably enough,
intermingle very little.
~
E
canyon rocky~
The canyon here is a smaller, almost separate section of the great canyon
which surrounds the entire southern Narak.  It sweeps around to the north
about the edges of the white desert and merges with the larger, main
canyon to the south.
~
E
larger~
The great canyon is made up of a series of rocky walls which rise up and
encompass the entire Naraki Desert and all of its branches.  Once the
walls of an ancient valley, the canyon now only surrounds a barren
wasteland.

White Sand Dunes~
Sand whiter than snow graces the dry, barren lands which unfold in all
directions.  Much of the white desert remains perfectly flat, shaped by
the gentle, sheltered winds of the rocky canyon.  However, in several
places scattered all over the desert, great piles of sand have suddenly
erupted, as if formed by some gigantic burrowing creature.  These dunes
of white sand stick out like a vyan in a hunting party of elves.

White Sand Dunes~
Though the grey rock of the canyon wall rises up and fences in the
southern portion of the white desert, the wall itself appears to make a
sharp turn off to the east, perhaps expanding the desert.  Here, dunes of
sand, taller than the tallest troll and twice the width of a desert
giant's shoulders, rise up out of the otherwise flat white desert, making
their presence known.  In fact, if not for the sandy white dunes, the
monotony of the sparkling white desert plains stretching out to the
north, east, and west, would surely be maddening.

Dunes of white sand stand proudly between the grey rock canyon, which
surrounds the western and southern parts of the desert, and the rest of
the snowy sands of the arid land to the east and north.  The light

Sand as white as snow and as shiny as cut diamonds stretches out in a

skeletal hand clawed~
The skeletal hand has but three fingers remaining, each of which ends in
long, ragged claws.  The index finger, with its long, claw of black,
points down to the base of the tallest dune.
~
E
base~
Along the base of the dune, there are a few remnants of limestone.  Sand
has filled them in nearly completely, making it impossible to tell what
lies below them.
~
E
remnants limestone~
The limestone fragments seem connected together and part of a much larger
network of stone that runs below the desert.  Most of the pale green
rock, though, is covered with loose sand.

White Sand Dunes~
Fenced in by the grey rock canyon wall sweeping from one side to the
other towards the north, the white desert here seems little more than a
pocket of a much greater arid land.  There is little evidence that more
than a small handful of creatures dare to brave the harshness of the
blinding white desert sands.  And judging by the minimal shelter the sand
dunes provide from the scorching sun, nothing could survive out here for
long.  The white desert stretches out in all directions except to the
north.

white sand desert~
Across the sandy plain there are numerous dunes of sand.  Shaped by
desert winds, the ant-hill like sand formations are twice, sometimes even
three times the height of an ordinary man.
~
E
rocky canyon wall~
The grey, rocky canyon walls loom up and form cliffs far overhead.  There
are no foot holds here, as the canyon walls are much too steep.  Several
scratches mark the rocky walls.
~
E
scratches~
The scratches which line the rocky grey walls appear to have been made by
something sharp, perhaps a digging tool or an animals horn.

White Sand Dunes~
A grey rock wall, part of a vast canyon which surrounds this portion of
the Narak desert, towers several hundred feet above the desert and curves
around to surround the sparkling white sands on both its north and east
side.  Although the white sand dunes here are not as graceful or shapely
as the barchan dunes in the main part of the desert, the sandy mounds
still possess an austere beauty.  More dunes of white sand stand to the
south and west.

The enormous mounds of sand which stretch across the face of the desert

The tall, ancient valley canyon curves from the east to the south.  Where
the grey rock corners, there is a sharp meeting of two slightly different

White Sand Dunes~
The glare reflecting off the white desert terrain and particularly the
dunes of towering sands is blindingly bright.  This appears to be the
southeastern corner of the small white desert. A wall of grey rock, part
of a vast canyon, faces in from the south and east.  Halfway buried
beneath the edge of a extremely tall and massive sand dune, a tree no
taller than a deer, struggles to hang onto life in this desolate land.

tree~
A gnarled, bent tree sticks up out of the white desert sand.  Its roots are
partly exposed and where they are, there are fresh gnaw marks.  Several
large, heart-shaped leaves cling to the tree's sparse branches.  Below the
large leaves there appear to be clusters of some type of brightly-colored
fruit.
~
E
fruit brightly-colored~
A cluster of brightly-colored fruit hangs from beneath on of the larger
leaves of the gnarled tree.  The surface of the fruit appears glossy and
even from where you stand, a vaguely sweet aroma reaches your nostrils. 
Covered with colorful splotches, the fruit looks very delicious.

Flat Wasteland~
Unlike the desert to the west, here, you have managed to find a section
of arid land devoid of the brutal sand storms.  Both to the north and
south, the sand is whipped about furiously by strong gusts of wind.  To
the east lies a calmer, flat stretch of desert terrain.

Flat Wasteland~
Nothing but plain, level sand covers the land stretching out before you. 
No rocks, buildings, plants, or animal dens jut outward out of the sand
to disrupt the flatness of the barren wasteland.  The sole exception to
the desert's depravity here is a single patch of darker sand.

patch darker sand~
The discoloration of sand does not look normal.  The edges of the oval
patch of darker sand are fringed with a deep ruby red.  As you get nearer
the center of the discoloration, it becomes a dull rust color.  It looks
as though blood has soaked into the sand here.

The spot of discoloration is indeed a place where blood has soaked into

Though high canyon walls surround the southern edge of this portion of

A set of heavy tracks, probably those of a beast of burden, plod onwards

Flat Wasteland~
Devoid of tall rocks or dunes, the desert terrain here is relatively flat
and unimpressive.  A small trail, possibly a lizard's, leads from the
surface of a flat slab of stone even with the sand only to disappear a
few feet later.  Far to the east looms a gigantic stone structure shaped
like a pyramid.

pyramid~
The gigantic structure to the east is a pyramid; indeed, it is the
largest of its kind you have ever seen.  Its surface has the polished
gleam that only limestone, after several centuries of weathering, can
have.
~
E
flat slab stone~
On closer examination, this slab of stone, while flat, is actually made
up of more than one piece of rock.  In fact, the slab is composed of six
carefully fitted blocks of pale yellow quarry stone.  The joints between
the stones are fine enough that you have to squint to make them out. 
Like the pyramid to the east, this structure, at least at one time, had
obvious purpose.
~
E
lizard's tracks trail~
A small trail winds its way through portions of the desert here and cease
at the entrance to a small hole.  The only indication that the tracks
belong to a lizard is the fact that in between the claw imprints there is
a line, probably made from a dragging tail.
~
E
hole~
About a foot in diameter, a small hole exists near the edge of the flat
quarry stone foundation.  Whatever lies within the hole, for its own
sake, is probably out of reach.

Endless Desert~
A plain of sand the color of dry camel dung stretches outward in all
directions.  Currently, a furious sand storm is sweeping through the
region.  There are no plants or rocks or any other type of landmark
nearby to enable you to get your bearings.  Only the vague outline of a
colossal pyramid to the east can be seen through the whipping sandstorm.

Tracks in the Sand~
The tracks of something large, probably a beast of burden, have been laid
in the soft desert sands.  Though the tracks are fairly fresh, the
unpredictable desert winds are liable to erase all trace of them within
the next few hours.  Leading south, the foreign tracks merge with a scrub
covered landscape.

Dusty, Scrub Covered Trail~
Scattered over the flat desert terrain, bantam bundles of brown grass and
small bushes strive to stay alive, their roots clawing into the sand
seeking precious moisture.  A ramshackle tent constructed from bits of
wood and canvas sits off to the east, half buried in a tall sand dune. 
The tent leans to one side against the outermost edge of a vast stone
structure whose presence dwarfs the entire region.  A well-trod trail
leads south through the desert, outlined vaguely by small rocks and
pebbles.

Erected from bits of desert debris and the tanned hides of many smaller

blow, the tiny flames within the lantern flicker back and forth as do

To the distant east, past the tent and tremendously tall sand dunes,

A path, bordered by scraps of canyon rock, leads southward.  Although

Hidden Oasis~
Nestled between the canyon and a rise of tightly packed sand dunes lies a
sparkling pool of water.  Rocks surround the edges of the oasis,
sheltering it from the loose sand kicked up by the usual sand storms. 
Several short but thick palm trees grow beside the thirst quenching pool. 
A slab of stone lies on its side underneath their branches.

palm trees~
Scattered around the placid pool of water stand short palm trees with
large green leaves.  The bark of many of the trees has an overcovering of
thin, brown moss.  Most of the trees are evenly spaced about the oasis'
waters and stone straight.  Two of the palms, though, one to the left and
one to the right of a stone slab, grow at an angle to one another, until
their trunks cross and form an "X" mark.
~
E
slab~
The slab of stone beneath the two palm trees looks extremely ancient and
heavy.  Cut into the shape of an oblong trapezoid, the slab bears a
superficial resemblance to a grave marker.  But instead of some witty or
melancholic epitaph, a series of hieroglyphics has been etched into its
surface.
~
E

The tall, rock walls of the desert canyon surround this oasis on all
sides but the east, where there is a slight cleft in the rocks.  The
cleft is all but completely covered by tall desert grasses and bushes.
~
E
desert grasses bushes~
Tall and thick, both desert grasses and brown bushes grow along the
eastern fringes of the canyon here.  A particularly large grouping of
scrub bushes gather along a cleft in the east part of the canyon wall.
~
E
sand dunes~
Titanic dunes of sand can be seen over the tops of some of the shorter,
interior canyon walls.  Taller than what some dwarves might fondly call a
mountain, a few of the dunes, especially a colossal one of black sand to
the south, command closer inspection.
~
E

There is definitely a mark formed by the two trees in the form of an X.
~
E

Like the cool waters of a stream, the oasis before you is crystal-clear. 
Strangely, though, this oasis is not as shallow as you have come to
expect from desert water sources.  In fact, you cannot see its bottom
though its waters are so clear.

Hermit's Tent~
The interior of this piecemeal tent smells of rotten meat and improperly
cured hides.  A half-eaten carcass of a large, furry beast hangs from the
main tent pole, providing a feasting ground for flies.  In the center of
the tent, a ring of stones surrounds a burning campfire.  Stuffed pillows
and blankets lie scattered around the edges of the campfire.
~
[Loxus] 'ask herm sculp' should ask him about the _stone_ sculpture
[Brenna] *grin* Okay, it says I find a dead mouse when I search the blankets. Perhaps one could be added?

E
campfire circular hearth~
The small campfire in the center of the tent lies within a pit, dug deep
into the sandy floor.  Twelve rocks encircle the campfire, which has been
allowed to burn low.  Only hot coals remain in the fire pit.
~
E
ring rocks twelve~
Out of the twelve stones encircling the campfire, no two appear to be the
same size or shape.  Though each rock looks to be of hard granite, veins
or chunks of minerals bulge out from their surfaces.  From a pale white
mineral to what looks like obsidian, the rings of stone contain an entire
spectrum of color.
~
E
pillows ~
Sewn together from animal hides and stuffed with whatever probably was at
hand, there are a variety of pillows resting about the campfire, just far
enough away from it to not pose a problem.  From a rotten duck feather
pillow to a soft and furry rabbit skin one, the pillows, at least, look
comfortable.  Who cares if they are not clean?  Behind one of the pillows
is a stack of old parchment.
~
E
blankets~
For the most part, the blankets are woven of course stuffs and have seen
better days.  Many are riddled with holes and tears along their edges. 
One blanket, though, looks remarkably well made.  It is made from a soft
fabric that has been dyed blue.  Around its edges there is a design done
in gold thread and glass beads.  The blanket looks much too royal to be in
a dump like this.
~
E
carcass furry beast~
Suspended from the main tent pole in the ceiling dangles the carcass of
some animal.  Judging from the chunks of flesh missing out of the beast,
it has served as a meal more than once.  Flies gather around the rotting
corpse as do maggots.
~
E
stack parchments~
Most of the pieces of parchment behind the pillow have been rendered
illegible.  Some have been ruined by water damage and others crumble at
the touch.  One piece of parchment, though, looks remarkably well
preserved.  It is made of pounded papyrus.
~

The page of pounded papyrus is covered with a series of hieroglyphics.

A Rising Sandstorm~
The beginnings of a sandstorm start to take shape as a series of wind
gusts gather up sand.  The sand, caught up in twirling masses of air,
whips through the air abrasively.  To the north, the desert winds are
much calmer.  What lies to the west, however, is another matter entirely,
for the sands in that direction look violent enough to rip the skin 
off your bones.

Caught between two canyon walls which rise up to the west and east, a

Swirling on whirlwinds of hot air, the tan sand clouds the air, stinging
your skin and making it very difficult to breathe.  There is some hope
though, for while the sandstorm rages to the north, it appears to be
slackening to the south.

Where most of the rocky canyon is either grey or tan in color, here it is

Black Sand Dunes~
Giant dunes shaped like three sided stars border the canyon wall to the
west and lie scattered across the remainder of the black sand desert. 
Eastward, past many lengths of desert wasteland, looms a massive stone
pyramid many hundreds of horse spans high.

Black Sand Dunes~
Black as night and hotter than the sun, the sands of the black desert
reach out in all directions, washing over chunks of fallen cliff rock and
large boulders.  To the west, the sands lap at the base of the black
canyon wall which stretches north to south.  Mounds of black sand in
spiraling star shapes dot the landscape in a pattern-like grace.

Black Sand Dunes~
Bordered by the ebony rock of a towering canyon to the west, the black
sands of this portion of the Naraki Desert flow outward, away
from their prison wall.  Bits of debris lay scattered about, sticking up
out of the grainy desert silt.  The vague outline of a pyramid stands out
against the sky far to the northeast and is barely visible among the
star-shaped dunes here.

debris~
Crudely stacked in a pile lies a few chunks of broken canyon rock and a
pale, yellow-green limestone, the likes of which you have not seen
anywhere along either the canyon or black canyon walls.  Beneath the
crude cairn of rocks, there are a few scattered bones.
~
E
bones~
The rocks covering the bones are much too heavy to lift comfortably and
you do not think it would be a good idea to disturb them.  However,
between a gap in the precariously stacked rocks, something long and made
of hardened brown leather pokes up out of the side of the pile.
~
E
leather brown hardened~
Judging from the size and shape of the hardened leather object, it
appears to be a scabbard.  The scabbard looks large enough to either have
once held a longsword or a broadsword but whether or not it still does
or not cannot be answered for it is lodged quite well in the crude rock
cairn.

Kicked up by erratic winds, star-shaped dunes lie scattered about the

the side of the canyon wall which acts as a prison for the desert sands
to the west.

Unlike the dune strewn plains to the north, the desert here is relatively

Scattered about the desert land to the east are what appears to be
several trees.

This is the western end of a narrow canyon which leads both north and

Black Sand Dunes~
Across the black desert plain lie dunes of sand shaped like spiraling
stars.  Beneath a couple of the sandy mounds, small brown bushes with
petite blue blossoms thrive despite the lack of moisture and the intense
heat.  Also, to the south, there appear to be a scattering of trees.

dunes star-shaped~
Unrelenting in their being, yet more star-shaped dunes rise and fall
within this portion of the desert.  Each dune has three arms, which curve
around like a windmill to form a star-lie pattern.  The crest of each
dune is level and smooth, as though a giant had come along a lopped off
the top of each and every single one.
~
E
blue blossoms~
Each of the honey-smelling blossoms has five petals attached to a thick
stem.  The center of each blossom is covered with a mass of fuzzy,
pollen-covered hairs.
~
E
bushes~
These tiny bushes have somehow found a knack for living in the harsh
desert environment.  Their leaves are of a glossy green color, a sure
sign of their vibrancy, and their petite blue blossoms have a honey-sweet
smell about them.
~
E
trees~
Though you can barely see them from the distance, what you can make out
about the trees is that they are tall, green, and branch like a deformed
pitchfork.

Arid Black Desert~
In all directions lay the hot, black sands of the desert.  The heat of
the desert is so intense here with neither rock nor dune to provide
shelter that it is even difficult to breathe.  At one point, the terrain
suddenly creeps downward into a slope but then ascends just as quickly. 
Southward, yet more dunes rise up across the sandy plain.

slope~
Where the desert slopes downward, there is more moisture and the desert
seems a bit cooler.  At the bottom of the slope, there are two yardangs,
which at one point have collapsed against one another to form a tight
crevice.
~
E
crevice~
The crevice formed by the two collapsed yardangs is cool and the sides of
it are coated with a thin sheen of moisture.  Careful not to emerge from
the crevice into the harsh desert grows a small velvet rosette.
~
E
rosette velvet~
Sheltered within the cool, damp crevice formed by the yardangs, this
velvet rosette has been allowed to flourish in an otherwise hostile
environment.  Though it stands no more than a foot tall, the tiny plant
is bursting with colorful pink and red blossoms.
~
E
blossoms~
The blossoms of the velvet rosette are of the richest pink and red colors
and are as soft as the plant's name implies.  The blossoms serve as a
quiet reminder that not everything in the desert is harsh and colorless.

Bound neither by dunes or an erratic canyon of ebony rock, the undaunted

yellow-green limestone, the pyramid rises up out of the center of the
desert.

E
yardangs~
These natural, one-piece rock formations rise up out of the sand in a
column of narrow rock and become wider as they ascend off the ground. 
Some of the yardangs are several meters tall and balance ogre-thick slabs

Black Sand Dunes~
A plain of glossy black sand stretches out in all directions before you,
giving you the impression of the endless night sky.  Periodically, a dune
of sand shaped like one of the celestial bodies in the heavens rises up,
its great shadow falling across the arid landscape.  Past many dunes to
the east stands a mighty pyramid.

Black Sands Desert~
Dunes shaped like stars dot the barren, black landscape which forms the
southern most part of the Narak desert.  The glossy desert plain, as

cannot make much detail out of it, a giant black dune looms like a
brewing storm to the northeast.

Created by the erratic and unpredictable high desert winds, the dunes of

it is hard to tell one from the next.  At the base of one of the dunes
here lies a pile of bones.

bones~
Too small to belong to a human, these bones could, though, have belonged

white by the heat of the sun, the bones have clearly been here for quite
some time.

Black Sands Desert~
Although the black desert sands rise up to form graceful dunes whose
shapes are much like the glowing stars in the heavens, the arid land of
black sand is otherwise featureless.  Only brief glimpses of movement or
the sound of an animal's scream off in the distance provide evidence that
the black desert is not completely empty.  A colossal star-shaped dune,
larger by far than any others within this black wilderness, looms to the
north.

Atop a Titanic Sand Dune~
An ancient tree, long since dead, sticks up out of this gigantic mound of
sand.  From atop the fantastically huge star dune, the entire southern
portion of the Narak desert can be seen.  From this vantage, it is
obvious that there is more to this desert than just sand and rocks. 
Moving rocks, hidden oases, carrion birds, desert foxes and all other
types of impressive formations and wild life can be seen from up here. 
Yet, the most impressive thing to behold is a stupendous stone edifice
with a triangular shape for each of its sides.

edifice pyramid stone~
An ancient stone ediface shaped like a pyramid looms mightily in the
distance.  Sheathed in limestone as pale as fresh spring grass, the
pyramid shines like a glowing beacon.  Deeply etched hieroglyphics only
partly visibly from any angle decorate the upper track of the pyramid tip.
~
E
ancient tree~
Old and gnarled, a thick but short tree stands upright out of the center
of the giant dune of black sand.  Most of its bark has been stripped away
and it has few branches left which have not been snapped in twain by the
high desert winds.  Judging from the size of its trunk, this tree could
be several hundreds years old.
~
E
branches~
Though only a handful of branches remain attached to the squat, dying
tree, the few still remaining have clusters of tiny, red and blue leaves. 
Along the underside of each branch grow short but thick spines.
~
E
trunk~
Most of the bark has been methodically stripped away from the base of the
tree, but whether by the wind or some toothy animal, it is hard to say. 
Also, a few roots lay exposed, which are also gnawed almost in two.  It
is no wonder this tree is dying.  Between the trunk's base and its roots,
there is a dark hollow.
~
E
hollow~
Cradled between two of the thicker roots lies a dark hollow, just big
enough for some medium sized animal to squeeze through.  There are no
signs of anything alive near the edge of the hollow and there is little
evidence thus far that anything truly dangerous would fit inside the hole.
~
E
leaves green blue~
Tiny clusters of blue and green leaves cling dearly to the last few
branches of the ancient and dying tree.  A majority of the leaves are
faded and wilted, as much as from the intense heat as probably the lack
of water.
~

Black Sands Desert~
At last, there is an end to the monotonous black sands as they surge
upwards to the east to lay against the side of a massive stone structure. 
The pyramid, for that is what the structure is, stands thousands of feet
tall and has a limestone surface which gleams like polished diamond.  The
pyramid's base covers an insane amount of territory, though the star
dunes block the northern way around it.

base~
Much of the pyramid's base is completely covered with the ebony sand.  In
some places, the sand rises ten to twenty feet above what you might
normally consider ground level to obscure portions of its foundation.  In
a couple of places, though, some of the limestone has fallen (or been
broken) away, exposing thick quarry stone blocks of a pale orange-yellow
color.
~
E
star-shaped dunes  ~
Like a child's pinwheel, three long, curving arms of sand spiral around
to form a scattering of dunes shaped like stars.  Most of the dunes bear
a remarkable resemblance to one another but here, one dune, which has a
large indentation in one of its arms, stands out against an otherwise
monotonous landscape.
~
E
indentation bird carrion remains~
Within the sandy indentation of the sand dunes lies the half-eaten
carcass of some type of carrion creature.  What remains is its head, part
of its body, a wing, and one of its legs.  It looks as though something
reached out and ripped the carrion creature right down the center.  A lot
of the bird's feathers are missing and its flesh has already begun to rot
severely.
~
E
pyramid~
As evidenced by its base, this giant pyramid is built of orange quarry
stone that was later covered with pale green limestone.  As the pyramid
tapers to a tip, rows of hieroglyphics begin encircling it.  The
hieroglyphic tracks are several spans tall and look to have been hand
carved.

the desert run parallel to the base of a vast stone structure here.  The
structure, an ancient pyramidal wonder, is many hundreds of feet tall and
its limestone surface practically glows in the light.

E
limestone surface~
Sheets of pale yellow limestone fit together seamlessly upon the outer
surface of the colossal stone pyramid.  Smoothed and polished by the
abrasive desert environment, the surface of the pyramid gleams in the
center of the Naraki Desert like a lighthouse beacon.
~
E
pyramid~
Taller than the imagination, the giant stone structure before you rises
up into the sky.  Surrounded on all sides by the Naraki Desert, the
pyramid stands out like a lonely child forever sheltered by parents which
are the sands held tight within the ancient sunken upper portion of the
pyramid.  Towards the tip, it is etched with hieroglyphics that are just
too high up to examine.
~
E
star dunes~
Formed out of the black sand, swirled mounds of silt rest in massive,
scattered heaps throughout the barren plain.  Most of the star-shaped
dunes are of the same approximate size and shape, but a few of them are
oddly-lopsided.
~
E
base~
The base of the pyramid, in places, shows signs of wear and age.  Cracks
run through some of the limestone sheathing and where the limestone is
completely missing, the quarry stone beneath is chipped and broken.  On
one section of the pyramid's base, it looks as if someone has taken a
chisel to its foundation, in an effort, perhaps, at treasure hunting.

Black Sand Dunes~
Here, in each of the cardinal directions, rises a star dune.  All four of
the dunes are about the same height and have approximately the same girth. 
Past a series of dunes to the east stands a colossal stone structure in
the shape of a pyramid.

E
star dunes~
Oddly enough, the four star-shaped dunes here lie each in a cardinal
direction.  The four dunes appear equally spaced apart and are all about
the same size and height.  A thick patch of brown desert scrub rises up
out of the middle of the dunes.
~
E
middle desert scrub patch~
Within the exact center of the cardinal dunes grows a tall patch of
desert grass.  About waist high, the thick, dead-brown-colored grass
waves to and fro with the gentle desert breeze traversing through the
area.  At the southern edge of the brown patch, something long and white
protrudes from the center of the grasses.
~
E
bone long white~
As you get closer to the patch of brown grass, you can tell that the
long, white object is just one of many bones which belong to a
dismembered corpse.  A few of the bones have been picked clean of meat,
but the majority of the corpse has been left to mummify in the hot desert
air.  About the size of a human, the remains, hidden within the patch of
brown grass, have yet to be fully picked over by scavengers.
~
E
corpse skeleton~
Though its flesh remains for the most part intact, having been mummified
by the dry desert air, the corpse in the grass has been completely
dismembered.  Its head lies tucked under an arm, its legs have been
removed from its body, and its hands are no longer present.  Something
savage and with a taste for killing must have wandered upon this hapless
adventurer.  The tattered remnants of armor and clothing still enclose
some portions of the corpse.
~
E
armor clothing  ~
The clothing and armor still wrapped around the mummified corpse appear
to have once been of higher quality than any normal man or woman might
have worn.  Bits of silver thread and lace hint that the person at one
time had a higher standard of living.  One thing the clothing and the
armor have in common, though, besides being extremely faded, is that
there is a small embroidered emblem of a single star located on each of
them.

Arid Black Desert~
The hot black sands of the desert come to rest here along the western
base of a great stone pyramid.  Judging from the size of the corner stone
here, the pyramid itself might be the largest structure in the entire
world!  Sheathed in polished limestone, the pyramid gleams and stretches
like a lighthouse beacon, lighting the way for wayward ships during a
violent storm.

Larger by far than any building you have seen in your entire life, the

Along the base of the pyramid, there are obvious signs of both age and

The Greened Way - Before a Twisting Canyon~
The road through the Greened Way is rough and uneven and becomes
increasingly treacherous as it continues westward.  A lone pine tree and
several shrubs hug the edges of the road as it turns southward into a
rocky canyon.  The canyon walls rise straight upward, like the walls of a
roofless tunnel and the uneven road runs directly through it.  Large
boulders and mounds of black earth block the rest of the Greened Way.

Mounds of black dirt lie beside the western edge of the Greened Way.  As

Arid Black Desert~
Across the barren wasteland lay the black sands of the desert like a
blanket of darkness.  Occasionally, a fragment of rock, usually a yardang
or an almost perfectly round boulder, emerges out of the night sands.  To
the north lay four star dunes laid out in the cardinal directions while a
massive stone pyramid looms nearly overhead to the east.

To the north rise four dunes of sand shaped like stars.  Each dune

the dunes is that they seem to each be representing one of the cardinal

E
pyramid stone~
From base to tip, the stone structure before you boggles the mind.  Who
and what constructed the pale, yellow-green limestone edifice is beyond
your knowledge.  You do know, however, that the techniques involved in
building the mammoth megalith have been used nowhere else.
~
E
round boulder~
As you examine the boulder, it looks like a normal, perfectly round rock. 
However, behind it, there is a trail, as though the rock has been moving. 
Yet clearly, the rock is as motionless as a mountain.
~
E
yardang~
A couple of yardangs rise up from the sandy black sea, offering perches
for whatever wishes to light on its surface.  Wide and flat, the yardangs
here balance on columns of black rock as black as the desert you are in.

Out of the ebony sands rise up three tall, oval-shaped yardangs.  Stacked
atop each shelf of rocks stand a smaller pile of rocks.  If not for their

of sand looms to the east, taller still is the colossal stone pyramid
which peeks over it.

canyon.

Atop each of the three yardangs stand small piles of rock.  So small are
the little cairns that it is unlike that they either contain anything or
have real purpose.  It is more likely that they have been erected as some
type of marker by some desert nomad or another.

Against an Extremely Large Pyramid~
Along the southern side of the gigantic pyramid, the hot desert sands
churn about like the waves of a restless sea.  There are long, deep gouges
dug into the stone where someone has removed the limestone sheathing and
carried off sizable chunks of quarry stone from the face of the
structure, perhaps looking for an entrance.  Up towards the top of the
pyramid, near the tip, you can make out part of a hieroglyphic track.

Having broken away during all the chiseling, hundreds of tiny flakes and

sheathing has been totally removed.  Most of the quarry stone flakes lie
scattered singularly, but some have collected in piles just under where the
chiseler was trying his best to do whatever it is he hoped to accomplish.

Edge of a Canyon~
Unlike the dune strewn plains to the north, the desert here is relatively
flat and even.  However, like most of the desert lands to the north, the
majority of the black sands bear no traces of life or moisture. 
Scattered about the desert land to the east and west, there appear to be
several trees.

Edge of a Canyon~
Though the desert here is extremely even, a change from the sweeping
star-shaped dunes, the most remarkable things are the trees growing up
out of the harsh desert sands here.  While the trees themselves have no
leaves, their green trunks and pitchfork-shaped branches bear a bevy of
little purple blossoms and sharp needles.

With a trunk as thick as its pronged branches, each of the unusual trees
stands tall and proud.  The trees have no visible bark and are all the
same uniform dull-green color.  Thin, spiny needles stick up off its
branches all over and a spray of tiny yellow blossoms cling to the tips
of each branch, which invariably point upwards.
~

The branches of each of the spiny trees are arranged as such to resemble
a stretched, deformed pitchfork.  Each branch sprouts horizontally from

The tiny clusters of yellow blossoms which decorate the tip of each

A glossy, ebony sand covers the ground beneath your feet.  Even so, it is
obvious from its hardness that there is rock just under the surface of

and completely devoid of leaves stand out against the otherwise barren
landscape while in all other directions the rocky canyon branches off.

Rocky Canyon~
Twisting like a desert side winder, the tall rock walls of the canyon
curve around from the south to the north, forming a cul-de-sac.  The
dun-colored sands of the barren wasteland lie in undulating mounds
against the base of the canyon cliffs.  Several rocks, having broken away
from the canyon, lie scattered about the sandy ground.  At the center of
the cul-de-sac rises a lone dune of sand.

cliff~
These cliffs represent the southern most boundaries of the twisting
canyons which surround the desert.  Several of the cliffs jut inward,
towards the desert, at incredible sharp angles, making it impossible to
climb upwards.  One of the cliffs, though, is sloped just at the right
angle to climb.  The face of this particular cliff has several
indentations cut into it.
~
E
indentations~
The indentations running up and down the face of the cliff would make
excellent hand holds.  In fact, judging from the cut marks in the canyon
stone, someone must have intended them to be such.  The indentations seem
to run down below the sand itself.
~
E
rocks~
Along the base of one of the cliffs, chunks of rock lie in a scattered
circle of fallen debris.  Although some of the rocks appear to have
flaked off from the sandstone canyon on their own, most of the rocks have
sharp, jagged edges, which is reminiscent of being chiseled out of the
cliff face.  And indeed, there are several indentations in this
particular cliff that nature had no hand in making.

Brown and withered, a tall, leafless tree covered in spiny needles has
been toppled by the merciless hand of a sand storm.  Broken bits of the
tree lie scattered about in the sand while the majority of the once

Strangely, because of the way the tree fell, the pitchfork-shaped
branches of the tree point south, to where there appears to be a set of
stone ruins.

Reaching high into the sky, a single leafless tree with a trunk easily

other cacti in the region, its needles are thicker and longer, and its
trunk looks almost dead.  Cut into the thick trunk, there is a small hole.

E

The hole inside the trunk of the cactus appears to have been scraped out
bit by bit over a fair amount of time.  Judging form the wads of grass
inside, the hole serves as some type of nest.
~

The nest within the cactus' trunk has been made from woven bits of grass,
both of a variety found only in the desert and of a type found only
outside of the desert.  Broken bits of egg shell lie scattered about the

Amidst Desert Ruins~
Sticking up out of the middle of the black desert sand rests a large
pyramidal construction.  Roughly ten horse-spans in both length and
width, the crafted stone sculpture resembles the great pyramid to the
north east, only vastly smaller.  Broken pieces of stone lie to both the

Edge of a Canyon~
Here, the canyon slopes upward enough so that the ebony desert sands can
only lap at the canyon rock below your feet.  It seems that you are
standing before the southernmost boundary of the twisted canyon which
surrounds the Naraki desert.  As in most cases, the cliffs here slope
inward, making any thoughts as to climbing them irrelevant.  To the east
and west, the rocky canyon continues onward, devoid of the black silt of
the desert to the north.

While the desert of black sand stretches outward to the north, here, the
rocky canyon slopes upward, so that there is nothing but rock beneath
your feet.  As the southernmost portion of the twisting canyon, the
cliffs are especially tall and steep, making them more than just
improbable to climb.  A series of dark holes, spaced too far about to be
used as hand holds, score both the east and south sides of the cornering
canyon.

Like the sea of dark water the black sands so closely resemble, the
desert silt begins losing its grasp on the terrain here.  The tall,
star-shaped dunes give way to the upward rising floor of the canyon.  In
places, there is nothing but the natural rock of the canyon beneath your
feet.  Tall cliffs, marking the southern edge of the ancient sunken
valley, loom nearly overhead to the south and west.  Eastward lies a
stretch of canyon which is also free from the hot, ebony sands.

An obsidian obelisk approximately two-feet wide at its diameter lies

Black Sand Dunes~
Between two larger star dunes to the east, there is a well trodden path. 
The further east the desert goes, the entirely black sand begins to shift
in composition.  At first there is only a slight intermingling of lighter
colored sand amidst the ebony grains, but soon, at the edge of the
eastern dunes, the sands once again are completely tan in color.  The
recent passing of several four-legged creatures as well as a drawn cart
is marked by a series of tracks.  A lot of the lesser vegetation along
the edge of the path has been trampled.

tracks~
The tracks leading east look a lot like horse tracks except for a couple
of reasons.  The first is that each imprint is much larger than that of a
horse's, roughly twice as big.  And secondly, unlike a horse's hoof,
these creatures have multiple clawed toes which are evident in their foot
prints.  Regardless of the differences, the tracks lead east toward the
southern side of the great pyramid and give evidence that the desert is
not as devoid of life as you were wont to believe.
~
E
vegetation~
Along the edges of the two dunes to the east, a few bunches of brown
desert grass and a couple of scrawny little bushes had, for some amount
of time, managed to exist in the harsh desert climate.  Now, though, the
efforts of these little plants have come to nothing for they have been
trampled by large beasts of burden traveling to the east.

Black Sand Dunes~
While there is only one of the star-shaped dunes which are found so
commonly in this portion of the southern Narak desert, it is, however,
very massive.  In fact, it nearly rivals the great dune which lies
several measures to the northwest.  A stark-white object lying atop the

As you approach the bleached-white object, it becomes quite obvious what

lizardman long since deceased.  The finger bones are clutched tightly
together, as though they once held a death-grip around something.
~
E
skeletal claw~
The skeletal claw is still attached to a skeletal arm, but you seriously
doubt it would be worth the effort to pull the corpse out of the sand. 
Oddly enough, there are no gnaw marks on the exposed bones of the corpse. 
Rather, there is heavy pitting in the bone, giving it a spongy
appearance, as though the bone had been soaking in something corrosive.

Black Sand Dunes~
A series of eight star dunes stand to the north, edge to edge with one
another.  Just south of the eight dunes though stands a rather oddly
formed dune which is quite lopsided, as though something extremely large
just took a bite out of it!  To the south, the black desert becomes more
even and has fewer dunes.

lopsided dune        ~
Though the dune looks quite ordinary from nearly every direction, it's
not until you approach from the north that the dunes looks particularly
unusual.  Where once it had three gentle, curving arms which formed its
star-like shape, the northern arm has lost all shape, as though something
incredibly large had plowed right into it.

Black Sand Dunes~
Strewn liberally across the desert plain stand immense piles of sand
shaped like spiraling stars. Formed by the unpredictable winds of the
region, each dune differs slightly from any other.  Some are taller, some
are short, and still others are lopsided.  The arid plain of night
continues outward in all directions.

An Arid Path~
To the west, there is a remarkable change in the desert terrain.  Not
only are the sands and dunes there composed of sands entirely black in
color, but the rocky canyon as well is made up of an ebony sandstone. 
Here the sands and dunes are of a rich, tan color.  Just to the north
looms the immense great pyramid.  A crude trail, roughly outlined by
miscellaneous bits of rock and stone, leads east to west through the
desert here.  And while steep barchan dunes lie to the north and south,
there is barely room enough between the northern ones to pass.

Against a Vast Pyramid~
Looming overhead stands a vast stone pyramid fully a thousand horse spans
tall.  Its surface gleams with polished limestone and has been decorated
with scores of hieroglyphics along its upper track.  At the pyramid's
base, though, significant chunks of stone have been dug out of the
pyramid.

E
base~
The base of the pyramid speaks of a less glorious future for the colossal
structure.  All along its base, vast sections of the limestone sheathing
covering the quarry stone beneath has been removed, exposing bare stone. 
And in many places, the quarry stone blocks have large cracks running
through them.  The cracks, though, do not appear to represent any
instability in the pyramid itself.  Rather, they seem to indicate botched
attempts of people trying to dig a hole into the stones.  A large amount
of debris has accumulated around the base of the pyramid in these places,
where the quarry stone blocks are in the worst condition.
~
E
upper track~
The upper track of the pyramid consists of a row of hieroglyphics which
run all the way around the top of the pyramid, just below its tip.  The
limestone sheathing of the track is of a slightly different color to add
emphasis to the gigantic hieroglyphics.
~
E
debris     ~
For the most part, the debris collected around the base of the pyramid
contains flakes of broken quarry stone.  Here and there, a piece of
desert foliage long since dead sticks up out of one of the piles.

Against a Vast Pyramid~
A tunnel about twelve man-lengths long has been cut into the side of the
pyramid in an effort to breach its interior.  However, the effort has
only served to slightly mar the magnificent beauty of this awesome
construction.  The winds of the Naraki desert heap sand against the side
of the pyramid, as if to bury it.  Along the top of the limestone-
sheathed pyramid, there are four hieroglyphic tracks.

Near an Impressive Pyramid~
The tan sands of the desert rise up to form impressive, crescent-shaped
dunes of sand to the north and south.  While generally too steep to climb
and too wide to pass between, as is the case to the south, the dunes to
the north are spaced fairly wide apart.  And from between the northern
dunes, you have a clear view of a colossal stone structure which is
incomparable to anything you could have possibly imagined.  A path
littered with foot prints leads from east to west through the desert,
past a pair of dunes to the east.

E
trail path~
As you examine the desert path, you notice that a greater number of the
stones which mark its boundaries look to be older and deeper buried.  You
can also see that a vast majority of these older rocks each bear a single
rune or character.
~
E
rune character~
As you look at a couple of what you suspect to be either runes 
or ancient characters, you notice that the markings are actually 
hieroglyphics. So, a single hieroglyphic has been either painted on, 
or in some cases carved, the border rocks. But why?
~
E
pillars stone twin~
The two pillars of stone that rise to the south are identical in every
way.  Though it could be just your imagination, but you see a faint
shimmering between the two columns.  It could be just a mirage.
~
E
pyramid~
Most of the entire pyramid is covered in green limestone so pale that it
appears almost white.  At its base, you can see orange quarry stone
peeking through where the limestone no longer is.  Though you cannot
discern them in much detail from here, rows of hieroglyphics encircle the
tip of the pyramid in four tracks.

Desert Ruins~
Just north of the crude path stretching east and west stands a heap of
limestone and marble stones atop plain quarry stones.  It looks as if one
time the marble formed columns which supported a roof of sorts over the
quarry stone foundation.  The ruins have been in this state for a long
time, it appears.  Not only has brown desert grass begun growing among
the ruins, but judging from the holes at the base of some of the larger
stones, animals have been using the ruins as a lair for quite some time.

E
limestone~
Every shred of limestone piled atop the ruins in this area is jagged and
broken into little bits.  The surface of much of the limestone has a
melted look, as though it came into contact with something blazing hot.
~
E
marble~
The remnants of marble piled all throughout the ruins are either round in
shape like wheels, or it is obvious that at one time, before they were
broken, that they were indeed round.  And judging from their uniform
shape and size, it seems that the marble fragments were part of huge
columns set into the quarry stone foundation.  The outer surface of much
of the marble is scorched and black, as if something extremely hot came
into contact with it.
~
E
quarry stone foundation~
The heavy quarry stone blocks, resemble not so much a foundation as they
so cap stones, or perhaps a roof.  And from the uneven positioning of
what you can see of the so called foundation about the sand, its original
locale was not here.  It seems as though it were planted here haphazardly. 
And judging from the cracked and shattered pieces of limestone still
sheathing portions of the quarry stone, it would seem some great force
crashed into this structure at some time or another.
~
E
holes~
At the bases of some of the larger stones, there are depressions or holes
where something has dug a hole under the slab.  The holes are half-filled
with sand though, indicating that nothing is like to be living in them
currently.

Twin Columns~
Gradually, the tan sands and barchan dunes of the Naraki Desert merge and
give way to bright, crimson sands which seeps to the east like spilt
blood.  And in place of barchan dunes, the red desert has columnar dunes
of sand with spiral designs creeping up and branching off its core.  Two
columns of stone, sticking up out of the desert sands, one from a
crescent-shaped sand in the tan desert and the other in a spiraling dune
of the red desert.  Beside and between the two columns, yet more sandy
dunes rise up, walling off the terrain which might lie to the south.  Far
beyond the dunes, you can see the tops of the canyon walls.

E
two columns~
Carved from extremely large pieces of marble, these two columns are
identical in every respect.  Both stand up straight out of the dunes they
are mired in, as though they have simply been partly buried.  The surface
of both columns has been inset and inscribed with a variety of things,
including a series of hieroglyphics and valuable gems.
~
E
barchan crescent-shaped~
The barchan dunes of sand sweep to the west, forming crescent-shaped
pillows of sandy earth all across the arid plains.  A column of marble
juts out of the middle of one of the barchan dunes, partially buried.
~
E
red desert dunes~
Where the tan desert ends, the red desert begins.  And this is marked by
a shift in dunes.  The tan sands of the Naraki desert have barchan
dunes which are wide but relatively flat.  But where the red desert
begins its reign over the region, the sands rise up in a spiraling column
with twisted spikes coming off of its core.  Out of the spiral dunes, a
column of marble sticks up out of the nearest one.
~
E
invisible field~
A near-invisible field stretches between the two marble columns.  Twinges
of barely- tangible energy cascade over the surface of the field, causing
whatever hair you have to stand on end.
~
E
gems~
The gems set into the twin columns are cut into tear-drop shapes and have
gleaming facets which reflect the light.  The gems are securely set into
the marble of the columns and nothing short of destroying the columns
themselves would remove the valuable jewels.

A Broken Statue~
Here, the crude, rock-outlined desert trail curves from the west to the
south, passing between two steep barchan dunes.  To the east stands an
even taller dune.  But this one is shaped simply like an overgrown
anthill.  At the foot of the hill, its base covered by sand, stands a
statue.  Beyond the statue, to the far east, the sky is shadowed by a red
haze.

sand dune anthill~
This gigantic mound of tan sand resembles an anthill in every 
way. All it needs is a troop of worker ants marching to and fro 
along its surface to play the part. Wider than the crescent-shaped 
barchan dunes, this dune manages to cut off access to the east.
~
E
statue~
This stone statue stands about three times your own height and rests upon
a pedestal which merges into the statue itself.  It has a muscular,
humanoid body, with bulging arms, legs, and pecs.  Its feet end in
vicious-looking claws and its hand(for only one remains) is poised as if
something once was held in its clawed grip.  Its other hand is no where
in sight.  The head of the statue is also absent.  Both hand and head
look to have been cleanly severed.

A Broken Column~
Hotter than a smith's forge, the searing desert sands seem bent on
sucking every drop of moisture from your body.  The occasional dune dots
the arid plane, adding yet more obstacles besides the extreme heat to
overcome.  A marble column, white in color, juts up out of one such dune
at an odd angle.  The edges of the column are jagged and cracked and bits
of marble lie near it, in the sand.  Far to the north looms the giant
stone pyramid while to the east you can see the remains of a flat stone
foundation.

marble column~
As wide as your arm is long, this column of marble leans to one side,
embedded in a dune of sand.  The surface of the white, marble column is
covered with faint pictures and hieroglyphics.  Unfortunately, exposure
to the harsh, desert climate has worn away the details of most of the
paintings.
~
E
edges cracked bits ~
The edges of the column are cracked and broken.  Fragments of the stony
pillar lie around it, strewn along the top of the dune it is buried in. 
Most of the marble bits are too small to discern anything about them, but
a few are covered with faint traces of pigment.
~
E
pyramid~
You stand almost directly south of a gigantic stone pyramid.  Most of its
surface is sheathed in pale green limestone that has become polished over
time.  Along the edges of the pyramid's base, the limestone has been
stripped away, revealing orange quarrystone beneath.

A Stone Foundation~
A depression has been made in the sand here and the remains of a
stonework foundation have been laid bare.  Around the foundation stand
mounds of sand.  Some of the mounds are natural dunes and some appear to
be merely piles, where the sand has been removed during the excavation of
the foundation.  Discarded by one of the piles of sand there are the
broken fragments of a few wooden shovels.

broken fragments~
The cracked and shattered pieces of several spades lie atop the sand,
only partly buried.  The digging tools look to have been fairly recently,
as the wood shows no signs of warping or bleaching.  The blade of each
shovel is splintered and dented heavily, as though it has been used
harshly.

E
mounds ~
The mounds of sand standing in piles next to the stone foundation and
natural dunes are what use to fill in the depression of sand.  The mounds
look to have been recently shoveled, since the desert has yet to
redistribute the sand.
~
E
dunes~
Dunes of red sand stand all around the foundation of stone, almost in a
protective stance.  Spindles of sand wind around a singular column, which
spirals straight up.  Each dune stands over fifty feet tall.  To the
east, the dunes have a slight gap between them.

At the Edge of a Small Forest Grove~
It is as though there were an invisible, one directional barrier between
the desert to the north and the small grove here which spreads out before
you.  The barrier, though, is nothing that you can see or even feel. 
Rather, it remains as a nebulous 'sensation' that crawls through your
mind like a boring beetle.  Two stone columns, twins in every respect,
stand at the edge of the perceived barrier, just to the north.  Through
the columns, you can feel the hot and blazing winds of the desert
sweeping through into the cool and moist climate here.  A border of tall,
tightly-spaced cedar trees grow to the east while a cornucopia of other
trees and colorful forest plants lie to east, west and south.  An
intangible feeling, that this forest has somehow remained untouched by
man, hangs heavily in the air.

Identical in every respect, the columns of stone which stand amidst the

Northeast Corner of a Small Forest Grove~
A majestic grove of innumerable years stretches out before you in all its
splendor.  At one time, you can tell this grove was probably the pride of
the valley.  But now, there are relatively few trees and those which
remain huddle about one another almost protectively.  The climate here is
very much different from that of the desert to the north.  In all other
directions, the assortment of trees and plant varieties are simply
astounding.

If there were more hours in the day, you still could not attach a name to
every tree found in this small yet vibrant grove.  For the most part, the
grove is ringed by oak or cedar trees.  Somewhere to the south you can
see the tell-tale peaks of pine trees.  You can also see a stand of
ashwood trees, a rowan tree, and a weeping willow, all near each other.
~
E
plants~
A wide array of plants have taken root in this small, sheltered grove. 
There are a lot of thistle vines growing up and along a lot of the trees. 
A few holly bushes grow to the far west.  There are even a few patches of
beautiful flowers like orchids and angel's feather strewn throughout the
grove.  You have but to look around you to discover the lush plants which

A Forest Grove Surrounding Ruins~
Leaving little room from movement in between, a series of tall cedar
trees rise up with their branches reaching up into the sky as if in
supplication.  Their leaves are of the deepest green and their bark shows
no signs of either animal or insect bites.  In a couple of places,
though, the roots of the trees are exposed.  While the edge of the forest
grove appears to be to the east, the grove continues onward to the west,
where there are oak trees of amazing size and proportions.  There is
enough of a clearing through the trees to the south for you to
distinguish the ruins of a once-great pillar of stone.

E
pillar stone ruins~
To the south, it is apparent that at one time, a massive pillar of stone
once reached up into the sky like a cleric begging mercy from the gods. 
But now, as is often the fate of such grand structures, its time has
passed, and it lies in crumbled ruins.  Not much remains of the obelisk
save its giant, pyramidal tip, which is still sheathed in pale green
limestone.
~
E
roots~
In a few places, the roots of the grand cedar trees are exposed.  The
reason for this has nothing to do with infestation or animal inhabitation
but rather age.  As old as they are, the cedar trees do not look capable
of withstanding the weight of their own limbs for many more centuries.  A
couple of chunks of rock lie wedged beneath some of the exposed roots.
~
E
chunks rock~
These chunks of rock are fractured pieces of quarry stone and look to
belong to the broken monument to the south.  The fragments of stone are
more than just wedged in between the roots of the cedars; they are a part
of them.  The roots have plunged directly through the stones in an effort
to reach the ground.
~
E
cedar trees~
Taller than stone giants and as straight as an arrow, you have seen few
trees as mighty as these cedar trees.  Only those of Medienne forest or
perhaps some of the greater Shuvana trees can rival these green giants. 
The leaves, which cover the cedar trees' branches, are of a rich verdant
and nearly twice the size of your hand and their bark is smooth and thick.
~
E
stump~
Obscured by shadow and the mighty presence of all the living cedar trees,
this large tree stump looks freshly cut.  You can still see the sap
oozing down its sides.  At the foot of one of the stump's roots, there is
a leafy green shoot branching outward off of the stump.  Perhaps the tree
might one day regain its place among its kin.

Northwest Corner - Amidst Tall Oak Trees~
Unlike the desert which lies just a few hundred yards to the north, the
climate here is cool and welcoming.  All around you, trees and plants of
both ordinary and exotic varieties thrive in a celebration of life.  Most
of the trees in this part of the grow are tall, sturdy oaks, whose
sheltering branches creates a canopy which is almost impervious to
sunlight.  To the east, past a large stump there is clear evidence of an
ancient stone structure while to the south, the forest flora is in full
bloom.  The trees and vegetation along the north and west grow in a
tangled mass, forming a natural barrier against trespassing.

E
1 east stump~
Just to the east there is a large tree stump.  From here it is hard to
tell what type of tree it once was, but judging from its size, one thing
is for certain.  It used to be a very ancient tree.
~
E
oak trees~
All around you loom mighty oak trees of every size and shape.  Some have
many branches while others have but a few.  The most remarkable thing
about the tall oak trees, aside from their bright green leaves, is that,
without fail, the tallest of the oaks lie at the edge of the grove.  Many
of the oaks' branches arc gracefully overhead forming part of the canopy
above.
~
E
canopy~
The canopy of leaves and branches up overhead allows but little light, be
it moon or sun, to pass down through to the ground.  Much of the canopy
consists of the upper branches of the mighty oak trees which surround the
outside of the grove in a protective circle.
~
E
plants~
All sorts of green and unusual plants can be found growing along around
the base of some of the trees and along the forest floor.  Several rubber
plants, a couple of holly berry bushes, and a host of thistle vines are
just a few of the many species of plants growing in the forest.
~
E
flowers~
Clusters of red and yellow wild flowers grow at the base of each oak
tree, adding a splash of color to their dark brown and grey bark-covered
trunks.  Also, in scattered patches along the forest floor, purple sage
bushes and white orchids flourish.
~
E
vegetation~
In terms of grass and other lower forms of vegetation, there is not much
for there is not enough sunlight for much to prosper in the ancient
forest.  Out of what little grass and vegetation that can grow, there are
three varieties.  The first two look to be of ordinary vines, but the
third appears to be of a hybrid grass which is dark green on the upside
and a velvet blue on the underside.
~
E
holly bushes~
The holly bushes clustered around a couple of the trees are just now in
full bloom.  With their smooth but jagged leaves protecting its crop of
fresh, new berries, most predators would probably think twice about being
lured in by the attractive berry.

Forest Grove - At the Edge of a Fallen Monument~
Though chunks of limestone and pale orange quarry stone litter the forest
floor from the broken monument which lies to the east, the plants and
trees do not seem to mind.  In fact, in some places the roots of trees or
maturing saplings have grown at unusual angles around the pieces of stone. 
In other places, the stones have been sundered in half by growing
vegetation forcing cracks in the stone wider.  Whatever the case, it
appears that the forest has undertaken the task of reclaiming the remains
of the fallen pillar of stone.  Patches of red and yellow lichen cover a
majority of the broken stone shirds.

E
limestone chunks pale orange quarry stone~
Much of the limestone is riddled with minute cracks and fractures, as
though some great force struck the once great obelisk.  And as for the
pieces of limestone which surround the broken chunks of quarry stone,
most possess blackened surfaces and char marks.  Markings or
hieroglyphics of some kind at one time had been etched over the surface
of the limestone, but time has worn the ancient writings smooth off.
~
E
broken monument 1 east~
To the east lies the broken remains of an obelisk which, at one time,
must have rose a couple of feet into the air.  Some of the quarry stone
blocks which lie about in cluttered heaps are ten to fifteen feet in
diameter.  The only part of the obelisk seemingly intact is its tip,
which must have fallen straight off when the monument collapsed.
~
E
roots~
While some of the roots have plunged willy-nilly down through the very
stone remains of the obelisk, others have grown down around the fragments
of stone, as if they were reluctant to touch the charred and broken stone
bits.
~
E
trees~
The trees in this part of the forest are a lot younger than those in
surrounding parts of the grove.  Both cedar trees and maple trees grow up
around the remains of the monument almost as sentinels.
~
E
shirds~
The stone shirds consists of smaller pieces of limestone and quarry
stones and many of the tiny fragments are covered with colorful red and
yellow lichens.
~
E
red yellow lichen~
Small patches of red and yellow lichen grow along the surfaces of many of
the tinier fragments of limestone and quarry stone which litter the
forest floor around the tumbled monument.  The lichen gives off an
incredibly sweet aroma which makes your mouth water.
~
E
vegetation~
Among some of the vegetation, you find a series of small, scrubby bushes
with curved, crescent-shaped yellow berries.

Tall Trees Surounding Ruins~
Tall cedar and pecan trees rise high into the sky, where they splay their
leafy branches to create a canopy of greenery.  Neither the light of the
sun nor the moons can penetrate too deeply through the blanket of life
overhead.  Piles of dead leaves, rotten pecans, and discarded pecan
shells litter the forest floor.  In many places, the trees grow close
enough together that not enough a gnome or a sprite could hope to get
between or past them.  What catches your eye most about about the grove
here are the stone ruins which you can see resting in heaps to the
northeast.  From the way the forest has encroached upon the broken stone
formation, it appears they have been in such a state for a long time.

trees cedar~
Among all the trees growing in the grove, here, there are tall cedars and
big, branching pecan trees.  Currently, the pecan trees have no pecans on
them whatsoever, though the ground is covered with last season's
downfalls.
~
E
canopy~
Created from the meshing of both leafy cedar branches and pecan branches,
the canopy above blocks out most natural light.  Here and there, where a
spot in the canopy lies open, there is a patch of grass growing on the
forest floor.
~
E

Having fallen from their cedar or pecan trees, dead or dying leaves lie
in piles beneath the trees, covering a significant portion of the forest
floor.

Rotten pecans lie in abundant little heaps all over the sparsely
overgrown forest floor.  The pecans look to have reached fruition and
then to have went unpicked, for many still cling to twigs.
~
E
shells~
Providing a natural mulch for next season's vegetation, lots of pecan
shells, empty ones, lie all over the forest floor.  Most of the shells
show some type of gnaw marks.
~
E
stone ruins~
The ruins to the east look to be the remains of a monument which probably
stood about a fourth as tall as the great pyramid.  The blocks of quarry
stone from which the obelisk was constructed lie in fallen heaps, and are
riddled with cracks and fissures.  The pale green limestone which once
covered the surface of the obelisk seems to have fared no better for the
chunks of it you see are charred and fractured.

Southwest Corner - A Stand of Pine Trees~
Broad, massive oak trees rise up along the edges of the grove, their
trunks so close together that you can barely see between them.  Just
before the edge, though, stands a copse of pine trees, whose soft needles
whisper in the breeze.  A few of the larger, older trees show obvious
signs of lightning and storm damage.  A pair of pillow-like rocks lie at
the base of a couple of pine trees, their granite surfaces covered with
soft and inviting moss.  The branches of an incredibly grand willow tree
droop sorrowfully to the east.

Before a Grand Weeping Willow~
Massive oak trees rise up to the south, providing a natural border for
the ancient forest grove.  While there are pine tress to the west, and a
lot of exotic vegetation growing en masse to the east, only a single tree
inhabits the clearing here.  And yet, the tree, a colossal weeping willow
whose height rivals any tree you have seen before, seems to be both a
tree and not a tree at the same time.  Its branches droop in graceful
arcs and its deep brown bark looks smooth and soft.  Besides its enormous
size, the only unusual feature about the ancient weeping willow are two
dark, pitted holes in its trunk.

The variety of flora preserved and packed into this small grove are
astounding.  Among the piles of dead leaves and lush green carpet of
grass to the east, a single orchid plant grows in the shadow of one of
the larger trees.

E
oak~
As with the other fringes of the ancient grove, tall oak trees grow
together along the edges to the south, as though to prevent anything
foreign from getting in...or out.

Forest Grove - Near a Weeping Willow~
All around you, there are tress of every shape and size imaginable.  From
apple trees to zrelbark trees, this small, secluded grove plays host to a
chorus of life.  Dark green vines hang from the boughs of a giant weeping
willow which lies to the west and to the northwest stands a circle of
trees more ancient than any in this forest if their size is any clue. 
Though the ground is covered with dead, fallen leaves and the occasional
broken branch, a carpet of rich green grass rolls out through the grove. 
In the distance to the far east, you can barely see the golden-yellow
leaves of a magnificently large rowan tree.

Near a Copse of Shifting Trees~
The trees in this part of the ancient grove are by far older than you
have seen almost anywhere.  Thick and sturdy trees rise powerfully to the
west in a complete circle, their trunks and branches so close together
and interwoven that it would be impossible for even a rabbit to wiggle
its way past.  In fact, it looks as though the only way through the
encircling grove to the west is to cut some of the trees down, which
would take more effort than its worth.  The encompassing trees act in a way
you have never seen before, swaying to and fro not with the cool and
gentle breeze, but against it.  It is as though the trees are wary of
your presence.  The forest looks much more peaceful and calm to the east,
and to the south, you can barely make out the drooping branches of an
enormous weeping willow.

A Golden Font Hidden Deep within the Grove~
Surrounded on all sides by trees and vines, this clearing lies virtually
hidden at the center of the grove.  A golden, three-tiered fountain
stands in the middle of the clearing, with water gurgling upwards out of
the fountain and falling musically from the topmost tier.  The font
appears to be made entire of gold, as do the statues which adorn it. 
Around the fountain, tiny honeysuckle bushes grow in abundance, filling
the tranquil clearing with a sweet-smelling fragrance.  All around you,
the trees shift and sway with the cool forest breeze.  Somehow, though,
while a sense of peace surrounds this place, the trees seem wary of your
presence all the same.

E
statues~
Each corner of the fountain is graced by a different statue.  The first
statue is that of a fairly attractive woman with six arms in a gossamer
dress.  Diagonal from her stands another female statue, but this one is
of a water nymph with serpentine hair.  Next to her is a statue of a
fabled wemic - the leonine equivalent of a centaur.  And across from him
is a handsome humanoid with feathery wings.  Each statue holds some type
of vessel from which a liquid pours down into the fountains basin.
~
E
wemic leonine~
Seemingly mixed together from both a lion and a man, the statue which
stands before you is like none you have ever seen before.  Like a
centaur, the upper portion of the wemic is that of a muscular man, with
bulging biceps and a mane of long, braided hair.  The man's face,
intelligent enough, resembles the ferocious features of a lion more than
anything.  Between the statues hands, he holds a wineskin, and from it a
pale red liquid flows into the fountain.  The lower portion of the statue
has the characteristics of a lion.  Its paws are quite large and tipped
with claws and it has powerful-looking legs.  A long, curving tail
protrudes from the hind end of the statue.  At the base of the statue is
a small, engraved placard.
~
E
handsome humanoid wings feathery~
In some ancient stories, there are tales of beautiful, winged beings who
serve the gods; they are called angels.  Gazing at the life- size statue
before you, you can understand why.  Clad only in a tight loincloth, the
statue has the form and features of a very handsome human male.  The
statue has both large and powerful arm and leg muscles.  Short crop hair
frames the statue's heavenly face and amazingly deep eyes.  At waist
level, the statue holds out a slender flask, from which pours a bright
blue liquid.  And as the liquid enters the fountain, some of it splashes
upwards, to drip down the statue's incredible pecs and abdominal muscles
and back into the fountain.  The only unusual thing about the statue,
aside from its incredible beauty, which even a troll might appreciate,
are the two massive, feathery wings sprouted from its back.  At the base
of the statue, there is an etching.
~
E
water nymph serpentine~
This golden statue is buxom and shapely beyond belief.  Wearing nothing
but a smile and her ankle-long hair, which, sadly, coils like a serpent
about her body strategically, the statue stands opposite another feminine
statue whose beauty can only pale in comparison.  The statue's face
resembles an elven maiden's; cool, serene, and beautiful.  In her hands,
the water nymph (for there is no mistaking her features for anything
less) holds an urn, from which a somber grey liquid pours into the
fountain.  Near the petite toes of the nymph, there is a small carving in
the gold.
~
E
woman six arms~
Neither attractive nor ugly, this statue is of an ordinary- looking woman. 
Her hair is of medium length and her garments those of a modest woman. 
About her head she wears a diadem of sorts, which encircles the crown of
her hair.  The only thing not ordinary about this female is that she has
six arms.  Count them, six.  Two of her hands she holds steepled, as
though praying.  Two more she holds out in supplication.  In her third
set of hands she holds a bowl, and pours from it a burgundy liquid which
falls into the fountain, to be mixed with its sparkling waters.  At the
statue's feet, there is an engraved plaque.
~

A series of unreadable hieroglyphics have been etched into the plaque.

E
water glitters field stars~
Until the water of the fountain mixes with the waters of the four
statues, it looks like an ordinary liquid.  But once it touches the floor
of the bottom basis and merges with the waters being poured out by the
four corner statues, it takes on a life of its own.
~
E
honeysuckle bushes~
A host of vine-like bushes with tender green leaves and clusters of
bright yellow, orange, and white flowers grow up around the base of the
fountain, filling the air with their sweet perfume.
~

About the found stands a circle of tightly spaced trees, whose branches
rustles nervously on the wind.  The only section of trees here which

At the Heart of the Small Forest Grove~
This may not be the geographic center of the small grove, but something
whispers into your mind that this its true heart.  There is a feeling of
peace and serenity higher than anything else you have felt here.  Much of
the forest floor is covered with dry and dead leaves and broken branches. 
The parts of the forest floor which are not have been overrun by dark
green wildgrass.  Tall, sheltering trees of every type stand like natural
sentinels in every direction.  Unlike most of the trees, though, the ones
to the west appear strangely different and perhaps a bit...nervous.

Between the smaller gaps in between the encircling trees, masses of wiry

E
leaves~
Heaps of dead and dried leaves already on their way to being reclaimed by
nature lie strewn about the forest floor.  The only thing these leaves
are good for are playing and jumping in.
~
E
grass~
In most places, the canopy of leaves formed by the surrounding trees make
it impossible for ordinary grass, a plant that loves sunlight, to grow. 
The grass here is no exception.  The only grass which grows along the
dark forest floor is a strange, pallid yellow grass with forked blades. 
Tiny mounds of purple and yellow stick up out of the grass in a few
places.
~
E
purple yellow mounds~
On closer examination, the tiny 'mounds' turn out to be mushrooms. 
Minuscule purple mushrooms with yellow dots along their caps protrude out
of the wild grass no more than a couple of inches.  The mushrooms smell
delectable.
~
E
trees 1 west~
The trees to the west shift to and fro, both with and against the fresh,
fragrant breeze.  If you did not know better, you would attribute the
motions of the trees to sentient nervousness.

Forest Grove - Near a Rowan Tree~
Massive and tall oak trees surround thus small grove, providing a natural
fence for the vibrant forest.  Flowering bushes and plants grow around
and near most of the fruit trees here, adding their own little splashes
of color to an already colorful and tranquil scene.  Situated as far away
from the trees as possible, there is a circle of stones set deep into the
ground.  Most of the stones are rough pieces of granite, but a couple
appear to be of pale green limestone.  Rustling in the breeze, the golden
yellow leaves of an ancient rowan tree, whose branches are thicker than
your waist, beckon to you.
~
[Brenna] 'surround thus small grove' should be this small grove.

E
circle stones~
Situated a safe distance from anything flammable, someone has built a
modest fire pit.  The pit is built deep and has been encircled with small
chunks and wedges of stone.  Whoever built this fire pit respected the
forest a great deal to take so much time and caution in building it away
from the trees and foliage.
~
E
granite~
Most of the granite rocks in the circle of stones are grey granite, a
fairly common rock, especially in the canyon of the Southern Narak Desert. 
Since you have not seen any other sources of granite near here, you
presume that the pieces here came from the desert.
~
E
pale green limestone~
Mixed in with the wedges of grey granite, there are a few fragments of
limestone.  Each piece of the pale green stone is slightly blackened on
both sides and tiny, hairline fractures riddle through the pieces as
though some great force impacted them.
~
E
fruit trees~
While there is an abundance of edible things within the small grove, the
trees here are the only ones which bear fruit.  And in fact, there are
two types of fruit trees here.  The first set of fruit trees look to be
pear trees, for they have glossy green leaves, white flowers, and pieces
of fruit which are spherical at the bottom and taper at the end towards
the stem.  The other trees can be nothing else but orange trees, for
globes of yellowish-red fruit hand from their many branches.
~
E
bushes flowering plants~
Among all the growing bushes and flowers, there is a large patch of red
clover flourishing beneath the fruit trees.  The clover covers much of
the ground where little grass will grow and it has leaflets in bunches of
three.  Globular heads of fragrant, rose-purple flowers peek up out of
the clover beds.

An Ancient Rowan Tree~
While there are oak trees to the south and lush greenery all around,
there is only one tree here in the immediate vicinity.  But, oh, what a
tree it is.  The tree has near-ebony roots which are partly exposed, a
trunk thicker than a pachyderm covered with dark brown bark, and immense
branches that look like they could buckle under their own weight at any
moment.  Juxtaposed against the burly and massive features of the tree, a
spray of delicate golden yellow leaves cover nearly every inch of its
branches.  If this tree is not the oldest in the grove, it is very close
to being so.

E
rowan tree~
Unlike most rowan trees who have clusters of orange-red berries and
sprays of gentle white flowers up and down their branches, this deciduous
tree is devoid of both.  Instead, the ancient tree has leaves of a golden
yellow color that even a blind man would find beautiful.
~
E
branches~
With a tree as ancient as this one must be, it suffers from an affliction
that it cannot get away from: weight death.  Judging from the looks of
the sagging branches, it is only a short amount of time before the tree
folds under its own weight.  One well placed kick or shake would probably
send the poor tree crashing to its grave.
~
E
thick trunk~
The bark of this deciduous tree is of a dark brown color and has several
places where branches were removed from its lower trunk in the distant
past.  Large knot holes are evidence of this.  Around a couple of the
knot holes, a wispy moss clings to the bark of the tree.
~
E
wispy moss~
In a couple of places, the wispy golden moss covers the trunk of the
tree, resembling facial hair and eye brows.
~
E
knot holes~
Though several knot holes mar the smooth, dark brown deciduous trees
bark, the two which look the most interesting stand side by side, almost
like eyes.  And as you look closer, a trail of golden moss runs down the
front of the tree as if to form a beard and eyebrows.  In fact, the trunk
of the tree looks so much like a face that you are tempted to talk to it.
~
E
near-ebony roots~
In several places, the near ebony roots of the grand rowan tree have been
almost gnawed in to.  Where this has occurred, a thick, viscous sap as
red as blood collects in small pools beneath the roots.
~
E
small pool blood-colored sap~
A rich blood-colored sap gathers beneath some of the exposed roots.  It

Southeast Corner - A Stand of Ashwood Trees~
At the southeastern fringe of the secluded grove, just inside the stout
ring of encircling oak trees, stands a small copse of ashwood trees.  The
trees vary in height, from a sapling which barely reaches up to your
knees to a gigantic brute of an ashwood who stands a good forty feet tall. 
At the foot of one of the ashwood trees, there are fresh scratches in the
dirt.  To the north rise the branches of a strange and gnarled tree while
to the west the golden yellow leaves of an ancient rowan tree weave in a
near-hypnotic pattern.

The small copse at the southeastern edge of the grove contains only

younger and shorter trees grow in a circle around the gigantic one.

The two foot tall, ashwood sapling looks pliable enough to break in two. 
Its soft bark is grey in color and has a tiny knot hole already set into
its exterior.
~
E
gigantic ashwood brute~
The largest tree in the copse, an ancient ashwood tree stands nearly at
the center of the gathering of trees, ringed protectively by the other,
younger ashwoods.  This incredible tree sports massive, compound leaves
and clusters of tiny green flowers.

Before an Incredibly Strange Tree~
You have seen a lot of unusual and odd trees in your lifetime, but this
one has to be the strangest.  While it has branches, leaves, and a trunk,
that is where the similarities between it and a normal tree end.  This
particular tree has bright orange bark, blue leaves shaped like
five-pointed stars and branches which end in human-like hands.  Several
pieces of cone-shaped fruit also hang from the tree, suspended from a few
of the fingered hands.  At the southeast corner of the grove rises a
small stand of ashwood trees and to the west the old but peaceful grove
continues.  The top of a massive rowan tree can barely be seen through
the canopy, to the southwest.

E
strange tree bright orange bark~
The trunk and branches of the tree are covered with a brilliant orange
bark.  The bark itself, rather than being an outer layer of dead plant
material, is composed of tiny, interlocking, triangular scales.
~
E
leaves star five-pointed blue~
About as big around as your palm, star-shaped leaves cling to the orange
tree branches.  Each leaf has five points, like a pentagram.  Wide veins
of red run from each tip of the leaf to converge at the stem, which folds
under some of the triangular orange bark scales.  The leaves cover nearly
every each of the strange tree's branches, except their ends, which end
in human-like fingers.
~
E
branches human-like hands~
As the trunk of the strange tree diverges into branches, the branches
rise upwards.  At the end of each branch are finger-like twigs, which are
black and not orange in color.  In the "grasp" of some of these "hands,"
there are unusual, cone-shaped fruits.
~
E
cone-shaped fruit~
Pieces of cone-shaped fruit hang from the hand-like ends of some of the
tree's branches.  Never before have you seen such fruit!  Each has a
circular base which is deep red in color but as the fruit tapers and
extends upwards, the color fades, until it is a creamy white color.  A
faint, minty odor hands around the fruit.

Near the Heart of the Forest Grove~
Though the lush and green grove is calm and serene, the clearing to the
west seems even more so.  Here, the trees grow at a slight angle in an
effort from their branches to break through the existing canopy formed
from the larger and taller trees around them.  Tiny saplings and sprigs
of grass grow along the forest floor in the spots where sunlight is able
to cascade down through the woven blanket of greenery.  To the east looms
a tall but strange-looking trees and to the south, at the edge of the
grove, stands a massive but ancient rowan tree.

Near the Heart of the Forest Grove~
The trees in this part of the ancient valley grove grow tall and
straight, with few branches sprouting off their trunks for at least the
first twenty feet.  Pieces of stone, shiny from a slick, wet moss
covering their surfaces, lie here and there at the base of a few of the
trees.  As light shines down through the leafy canopy, shadows play
across the wrinkled bark of the trees, giving you the impression of faces.

E
trees~
In this part of the grove, there is something quite unusual about the
trees.  For one thing, they are all of the same variety, though exactly
what you have no idea.  Secondly, every single tree looks to be of the
same height.  Last but not least, the trees appear to have only two
thick, massive branches supporting a host of green leaves.
~
E
slick wet moss~
So green it is almost black, thick moss covers almost every inch of the
rocks and stones lying amidst the leaves on the forest floor.  Strangely,
the moss cannot be found anywhere on the trees here, as though it dare
not touch them.
~
E
pieces stone~
A few slabs of stone lie on the ground and look like perfect places to
sit.  Mostly, the slabs are made of granite, but one or two of them have
been cut from orange quarry stone and appear to have been dragged here.
~
E
4 bases~
At the base of each tree, two huge roots can be seen plunging down into
the earth, undoubtedly in search of nutrients.  Usually, trees have more
than just two roots holding them in place but these mighty trees
apparently need only two.

Clearing in the Forest - Near a Fallen Obelisk~
While trees and plants lie in every direction elsewhere, here they
recede, leaving a quaint little clearing, perfect for picnics or just
lounging around and taking in the wondrous view of exotic flora.  Several
slabs of pale orange quarry stone and limestone lie about the clearing,
covered with moss and colorful patches of lichen.  The chunks of stone
appear to be fragments of debris which have broken off of a much larger
stone formation, which rests on its side, in ruins, to the west.  Judging
from the vegetation growing on and over the stones, it has rested thus
for quite some time.

flora~
The most exotic pieces of flora in this part of the wood have to be a

half the clearing.
~
E
snapdragon flowers~
The snapdragon flowers growing along the edges of half the clearing stand
about a foot and a half tall and have petals either of a solid red,
yellow, or orange color with shades of the other two along the fringes.
~
E
clearing~
The ground, at last, is covered with a thin carpet of deep green grass,
for there are enough gaps in the canopy to allow ground cover to grow
here.  There are several rocks on which to sit on and a particularly flat
rock that would serve as a nice picnic table.
~
E
slabs orange quarry stone limestone chunks  fragments~
The pieces of stone scattered about come in two varieties: limestone and
quarry stone.  The quarry stone is of a faint orange color and composes a
bulk of the debris.  The limestone on the other hand is of a pale shade
of green and is far less abundant.  Both types of stone have suffered
severely, for cracks and charring score their surfaces deeply.
~
E
moss~
On the surface of both the rocks and trees grow a blood-red moss.  Unlike
most mosses which are soft and wet to the touch when in their prime, this
moss is coarse and dry.
~
E
lichen~
A foul-smelling lichen covers a fair amount of the rocks and trees in
this section of the grove.  While the lichen does not look to be of a
poisonous nature, you can never tell for sure.
~

To the west lie the toppled ruins of a once tall and tapering monument. 
Blocks of quarry stone and limestone sheets rest in tumbled messes all
over.  At the center of the mess if a pyramidal structure, which at one
time probably was the tip of the monument.
~
E
vegetation~
Thick, sturdy vines creep and crawl over, under, around, and through all
the dark recess and over the stone ruins themselves.  For the most part,
the vines encompass most of the rocks, except in a few rare cases where a
sprig of some wild herb grows.

Atop Ancient Ruins~
Surrounded on every side by imposing, spiraling dunes, a series of stone
ruins lie in a crumpled mass at your feet.  In places, the stone ruins
are completely covered by crimson sand while in others, the remains of
the structure can clearly be seen, just as if someone has tried to
excavate a portion of it.  From what lies above the desert's sandy
surface, you can see a few broken columns carved from pale orange quarry
stone.  The corners of a few square-cut blocks of the same stone also
stick up out of the sand.

ruins~
It is impossible to gauge what the ruins used to be, there simply is not
enough of the structure left, at least on the surface, to make an
educated guess.  But judging from the columns and blocks, the ruins could
have formed the roof or a floor of some small building.  The size and
thickness of the quarry stone blocks is suggestive that they probably
could not have been functional foundation stones.

The columns of stone which stick up out of the swirling red sands are
about three feet in diameter and perfectly round.  Faint but legible
hieroglyphics adorn one of the columns.

Cut with a precision which belies their apparent age, the blocks of stone
are massive, yet thin.  They are carved from pale orange quarry stone and
only the corners appear to be at all weathered, as though they have only
recently been exposed to the elements.  The edge of another cut block,
this one of red sandstone, juts out of the side of one of the spiraling
dunes to the east.
~
E
1 east edge sandstone~
The block of red sandstone wedged into the side of one of the eastern
dunes of red sand looks purposefully placed there.  The stone glistens
like no sandstone you have ever seen, as though it has been coated with
something.  A few fissures travel over the surface of the sandstone block.
~
E
fissures~
The fissures appear to run throughout the entire block of sandstone.  It
would not take much to bash or crush the block into oblivion.
~
E
spiraling dunes~
Stream-like arms spiral off of central columns of sand, forming swirling
mounds of arid earth all around the ruins here.  The dunes stand tall and
in every direction, surrounding the ruins.  There seems to be very little

Before a Squat Tower of Sand~
A short, square tower built from sheets of red sandstone stands at the
end of this section of the desert like a boulder in a cul-de-sac.  The
tower has but one level and its top is rimmed by battlements.  A pile of
bound reeds lie up against the front of the tower, their ends flapping in
the breeze.  Immense dunes of sand stand in every other direction. 
Something strange seems to be near the reeds.

reed door~
A pile of reeds stacked side to side lean up against the front of the
short tower.  The reeds stand about seven tall and are of a dried tan
color.  Strips of leather coil about the reeds, binding them together
into a flat, door-like plane.
~
E
dunes immense~
Large, behemoth dunes of stand loom to the south and east, blocking your
view in those directions.  These spiral dunes are perhaps some of the
tallest ones you have seen.  A passage lies through one of the western
dunes, but it appears a stone block denies passage through it.
~
E
battlements~
The battlements of the squat tower have spear-like points jutting up out
of their tops.  The alternating indentation of the battlements, though,
seem too narrow and stilted to be used for defense.
~
E
red sandstone walls~
The sandstone walls of the tower glisten with moisture.  However, as you
look closer, the moisture is actually a coating of hardened resin.  Which
also means the sandstone walls are actually just carefully molded sand
walls.
~
E
stone block~
A stone block lies wedged in a passage through the side of a westerly
dune.  Deep cracks run through the stone.  It probably would not take
much to smash it open.

Inside a Squat Tower of Sand~
The interior of this short tower of sand is surprisingly sophisticated
for its decor is nothing what you might have expected in the desert.  The
tower is completely round on the inside and stands about forty feet tall. 
Spiraling around the resin-coated walls are shelves of sand which jut
directly out of the walls.  Upon the shelves are a variety of scrolls,
tomes, and objects, each of which looks anywhere from mildly old to
extremely ancient.  The floor of the tower has been tiled with small
squares of alternating red and black glass, upon which sits a chair,
table, and desk, all made out of sculpted sand.  On the east wall, just
under a particularly high bookshelf, hangs a worn and tattered tapestry
and to the south stands a door formed from bound reeds.

2187 -1 48147 10 10 5
E
door bound reeds~
Thick, century-old reeds, bound together with strips of hide, form a door
which is set into the south wall.  Though crude, the door prevents the
elements for wandering in uninvited (as well as vagrants) and is lockable
from the inside, by way of a descending bar.
~
E
worn tattered tapestry 1 east~
Woven from bleached desert grass, the tapestry which hangs here is very
old and perhaps dates back to the founding of this small settlement. 
Most of the tapestry is too faded to make out, but from what you can see,
it appears that a deadly scene of conquest is taking place.  Hordes of
crab people are fleeing from the great pyramid while a bolt of lightning
strikes its tip.  At the edge of the tapestry, you notice that a bar
mechanism runs behind it and you realize that the tapestry is a concealed
door out to the east.
~
E
scrolls **M**~
Out of all the scrolls lining the shelves, very few, if any, appear
useful.  Most seem to be ancient and would probably crumble to dust at
the slightest touch.  Each scroll is carefully rolled up and bound with a
single ribbon of hide.
~
E
tomes **M**~
This modest library of books contains more volumes than many you have
seen previously.  Unfortunately, if the foreign scripts down their spines
are any indication, all of them are illegible.  The tomes vary in size,
color, and shape; from a round, palm-sized volume bound in blue, scaly
hide to a two-foot, green librum which is about as thick as your arm and
has been bound in the shape of a triangle.
~
E
objects **M**~
While the scrolls and tomes outnumber the objects on the shelves, the
objects themselves are nonetheless as interesting.  Placed at the
beginning and end of each shelf, probably as bookends, the objects vary
in type and oddity, from the skull of what you think must be a crabman,
to a stylized string instrument.
~
E
bookshelves shelves **M**~
The bookshelves which spiral up and around the tower are actually
extensions of the red, sandy walls themselves.  They jut straight out,
providing a flat surfaces for the books to rest upon.
~
E
floor tile squares black red **M**~
Small tiles of black and red glass stretch around the length of the floor. 
The pattern of colored-tiles alternates so that there is never two tiles
of the same color side by side.
~
E
chair~
A high-backed chair with an unusually wide seat sits behind the desk and
to the side of the large, sand-sculpted table, so that it might be used
for sitting at both.  Formed from resin-coated red and black sand, the
chair matches the alternating tiled floor perfectly.  The arms of the
chair bear deep scratch marks, as though they were the frequent victim of
someone's agitation.
~
E
table **M**~
Sculpted from black sand and coated with a clear, hardening resin, this
table stands about three feet high and lies adjacent to the desk in the
chamber.  The surface of the table is clear of everything, except for a
few pieces of old papyrus.
~
E
old papyrus **M**~
The papyrus on the desk appears to be some type of official document.  It
is written in a flowing script you would not have credited the crab
people with and bears some type of official seal down at the bottom.
~
E
desk **M**~
Sculpted from red sand and coated with hardening resin like every other
structure and piece of furniture you have seen thus far, this desk stands
in front of a large chair and adjacent to a large table.  The desk has
but a single drawer and its surface is clean of anything but a quill of
sorts, a few sheets of blank papyrus, and a bottle of what must be ink.
~

ink bottle **M**~
The bottle on the desk contains a thick, black fluid which looks harmless
and is probably what you think it is: ink.

At the Base of a Spiraling Column of Sand~
You stand along side one of the southernmost edges of the great canyon
which surrounds the entire Naraki desert.  The endless sands continue
outward, lapping at the base of the canyon walls like errant waves.  Out
of the center of these waves of sand, a single, columnar-dune rises,
twisting and spiraling upward like an alicorn.  A few loose pebbles rest
along the foot of the spiraling column of sand.  The battlements of two
identical castles built from red sandstone peek up over dunes of sand to
the southeast.

Before Twin Castles of Red Sand~
To the south, at the edge of the red desert, stand two castles of
sandstone, whose turrets and battlements rise into the sky as tall as any
dune.  The castle which stands to the direct south has three towers, each
of whose top is graced by tiny green flags which flap in the breeze.  The
shadow of an enormous spiral of sand stretches in front of the castle
from the west.  Adjacent to this castle, to the east, looms its twin. 
The walls between each castle are oriented so that the eastern castle
cannot be reached directly from here.

E
towers battlements~
At the points along an imaginary triangle, three towers rise up, forming
the corners of the castle.  The battlements which branch off from the
towers have alternating indentations, designed for defense.  The
indentations, though, appear too thin to offer much protection.
~
E
walls~
What look to be individual blocks of red sandstone have been closely
stacked and fit together to construct the walls of this fortification. 
The surface of the sandstone, though, has a dew-like sheen on it.  Set
into the frontmost wall is a flat, driftwood beam several feet across.
~
E
driftwood beam~
A beam of driftwood, larger than most, stands upright against the front
castle wall.  The beam is very old and half-petrified and stands in the
exact middle of the castle wall, like a door.
~
E
dew-like sheen~
On closer inspection, the dew-like sheen is actually a hardened resin
which has been applied to each inch of the castle's surface.  Indeed, the
walls are not made of sandstone blocks, but of sculpted sand!
~
E
spiral shadow~
The shadow which stretches across part of the western twin castle belongs
to a spiraling tower of stand which stands like a silent sentinel to the
west.

The castle whose walls adjoin this one is its exact twin.  Save for
having a different amount of towers and colored flags, both twins look to
be mirror images of the other.

Before a Squat Tower of Sand~
The red, sandy plains of the desert are fairly level here.  Except for a
series of unusual formations of sand to the east, this area looks as
though the sand has been artificially leveled.  Abruptly to the west, a
squat tower of sand ascends into the sky (at least for thirty or so feet). 
From the side of the tower hangs a mat of braided grasses.  The walls and
towers of red sandstone castles can be seen in nearly every direction.

Inside the Western Twin Sand Castle~
The inside of this sand castle is relatively plain and not too large. 
The chamber probably stands about thirty feet tall and goes back about
twenty feet.  It has few embellishments.  On the western wall there
stands a brazier forged of a dark, smoky glass and back towards the south
wall stands a statue on a marble pedestal.  The floor is covered with
loose sand and a heap of the sandy material lies against the eastern wall
of the castle.  A single table and chair are the room's only pieces of
identifiable furniture.  A giant beam of driftwood, several feet thick
and wide, hangs from hinges set into the northern wall of resin-coated
sand. The giant piece of driftwood is being used as a door.

brazier dark smoky glass ~
Forged from melted black sand, this fire brazier stands about two feet
tall and has a delicate lattice of glass filigree cascading up and down
its length.  Three spiraling columns of smoky glass jut outward from the
bowl of the brazier, acting as a tripod for the glass fire burner.

1 south statue~
Sculpted from white sand and glazed with hardening resin, this statue
bears close resemblance to a human with the head and poise of a cat. 
Obviously feminine, the statue rests upon a pedestal of marble, giving it
a height of about five feet.  While in good condition, a few cracks mar
the base of the statue, probably from age.

This small, round table has three legs and a triangular table top.  The

is made from red sand.  Both are covered with hardening resin, to help
them keep their shape.  There is nothing on the table.
~
E
chair **M**~
This red chair is shaped from the sand of the desert and mixed with
resins and pigments to harden and darken the color of the medium.  It has
a low back and long, wide arm rests.  Loose sand has been piled in the
seat of the chair, to provide a softer surface on which to sit.

E
driftwood beam~
This thick beam of salvaged wood stands about six feet tall and is
approximately four fe to the northern wall by brackets and strips of
leathery hide.  Two slots, one to either side of the beam, allow for a

barricade the door.  Such a piece of slim wood leans up against the

The chamber probably stands about twenty feet tall and goes back about

brazier light tan glass **M**~
This delicate fire burner is truly a work of art.  Graceful limbs of
glass curve down from its fiery bowl to form four, geometrically enhanced
legs.  Around the rim of the brazier, tiny glass forest animals dance and
frolic around a scene of foliage and life.  As the brazier consumes
handfuls of dried desert grass, it gives off a pleasant and smokeless
scent.

The statue resting upon a malachite pedestal has the features of a

flowing gown and her features and poise are vaguely reminiscent of a
predatory cat.

This simple, high-back chair rests a comfortable distance away from the

wood, the chair looks extremely hard.

giant oyster shell ~
A giant, fresh water oyster has been killed and its shell mounted by
hinges on the northern wall.  Thus, it serves the purpose of a makeshift
door.  To either side of the shell there are notches through which a
sliding bar can be dropped into place, thus keeping anything out of the
castle chamber.  Next to the oyster shell is just such a bar.

Before Twin Castles of Red Sand~
To the south, at the edge of the red desert, stand two castles of
sandstone, whose turrets and battlements rise into the sky as tall as any
dune.  The castle which stands right in front of you has six, slender
towers, each of whose top is graced by large blue flags which lie limp,
regardless of the breeze.  The walls of the eastern twin castle are
oriented as such that the other castle cannot be reached directly from
here.  In the distance, to the north, stretches a path which runs north,
back into the main desert.

E
towers battlements~
At the points along an imaginary trapezoid four towers rise up, forming
the corners of the castle.  The battlements which branch off from the
towers have alternating indentations, designed for defense.  The
indentations, though, appear too thin to offer much protection.
~
E
walls~
What look to be individual blocks of red sandstone have been closely
stacked and fit together to construct the walls of this fortification. 
The surface of the sandstone, though, has a dew-like sheen on it.  Set
into the frontmost wall is a curved, shell from a giant, fresh water
oyster.
~
E
giant fresh oyster shell~
The giant shell has a speckled white and blue surface, with bits of rock
adhered to it.  From the ridges along its lip, the oyster looks to have
come from a large body of fresh water.  Rather than leaning up against the
wall, the oyster shell looks to actually hang from the castle wall, like
a door.
~
E
dew-like sheen~
On closer inspection, the dew-like sheen is actually a hardened resin
which has been applied to each inch of the castle's surface.  Indeed, the
walls are not made of sandstone blocks, but of sculpted sand!
~
E
spiral shadow~
The shadow which stretches across part of the western twin castle belongs
to a spiraling tower of stand which stands like a silent sentinel to the
west.
~
E
1 west twin~
The castle whose walls adjoin this one is its exact twin.  Save for
having a different amount of towers and colored flags, both twins look to
be mirror images of the other.

Red Desert Path with a Branching Trail ~
Continuing unimaginatively onward like a caravan slave, the path through
the red desert sweeps ever on its course, from north to south. 
Characteristic red blocks of granite stand to either side of the broad
desert trail, marking, perhaps, the safe points in the path.  Here
though, the trail branches to the east and has cruder blocks of red
granite demarcating it.

E
red granite blocks~
There are two sets of red granite blocks in this part of the desert.  One
set are smoothed and polished, and the other are fashioned from cruder
chunks of granite and have coarse edges.  The later look amazingly like
rejects.
~
E
polished smooth~
The smoothed blocks of red granite are polished until they almost gleam. 
Their edges are sharp and precise and their surfaces are devoid of any
scratches or markings.
~
E
cruder coarse rejects~
The coarse blocks of red granite stand to either side of a smaller trail
which branches off the main path.  The trail travels to the east, where
you can see the top of a tent.  The surfaces of the granite plugs of
stone look much older and weathered and have marking alongside them.
~
E
markings~
The markings etched in the surfaces of a few of the older, cruder blocks
of granite appear to be hieroglyphics.

Outside of a Large Tent~
A crude, rectangular tent fashioned from strips of animal hide attached
to slender poles has been erected at the end of the desert trail's only
branch.  The tent looks very old and smells of ill-cured hides.  The
front of the tent has leather fastening strips, along where the material
looks to part.  Red blocks of granite stand to either side of a path
which winds to the west and merges with a wider trail heading north and
south.

E
animal skins hides~
For the most part, the animal skins are light in color and sewn together
crudely with yet more strips of animal hide or leather.  The majority of
the hide is covered with short, soft fur, which reminds you of a desert
hare.  The rest consists of various, unidentifiable shreds of skin.
~
E
slender poles~
These slender poles appear to be a type of reed or bamboo that you have
not seen growing in any part of the desert.  The poles are dead and
lifeless, having been cut sometime ago.
~
E
leather strips~
The leather strips on the front of the tent seem to be meant for securely
closing the tent during times of privacy, need, or rising desert storms. 
Currently, the strips of leather hang loose and unfastened on the tent
flaps.
~
E
flaps~
The flaps of the tent are really nothing more than two large animal skins. 
The skins, if the odorous, shaggy fur still attached to them is any
indication, once belonged to a camel.
~
E
blocks granite red~
The blocks of granite here are not as smoothly polished or as cleanly cut
as the rest of the blocks which form the desert trail just to the west. 
In fact, not only are the blocks more crudely fashioned, but they are
also crooked and uneven, and look to have been placed here as an after
thought.

Desert Trader's Tent~
Fashioned from animal skins sewn together with crude skill and ribbons of
leather, this small tent stands about eight feet tall and has barely
enough room for three, maybe four people of human height to stand
comfortably.  The interior smells of rotten flesh and contaminated water. 
In the middle of the tent stands a tiny, ironwork brazier, which gives
off a faint amount of heat.  Woven blankets and hides lie on the floor of
the tent, offering but little comfort from the hard, sandy ground. 
Hanging from a support pole in the ceiling of the tent there is an unlit
lantern.  Shadows clamber around the corners of the tent.

tent 1 west~
This rectangular tent is constructed from supple but dried reeds and
pieces of animal skin.  Two large, shaggy furs hang from the west end of
the central tent pole.  Between the two skins runs a seam along where
leather straps can securely fasten the two flaps closed.
~
E
flaps~
The two flaps of skin hang limply at the western end of the tent.  The
flaps can easily be parted though.
~
E
pole ceiling~
A wide, supple reed runs the length of the tent's ceiling, supporting the
fabric of animal hides hanging off of it.  A chain hangs from this
central support and from it, a lantern swings gentle from side to side.
~
E
unlit lantern~
Unlike most lanterns which hold oil, this one holds a simple, fat candle. 
The lantern is forged from pieces of iron melded together and curled with
an eye for detail.  Triangles of glass with a shiny, metallic backing
line the interior of the lantern with the apparent purpose of directing
all the light out of one panel.
~
E
woven blankets~
A few old, woven blankets lie on the floor of the tent.  The blankets,
though riddled with holes and tears, look well cared for.  Woven from
plant fibers, the blankets are a little rougher than you would like.
~
E
hides~
The majority of the animal skins the tent fabric is composed of are
small, furry, and soft.  Many of them remind you of desert hare skins. 
The others look to be either camel or lizard hides.
~
E
brazier ironwork ~
Forged completely from iron, the brazier is very elegant in design.  It
has a flowing rim and curving legs.  Pieces of rose-colored glass are set
into some of the ironwork, making the simple fire brazier a work of art.

Red Desert Path - Before A Colossal Sand Castle~
Blocks of red granite run parallel to one another as they create a
north-south section through part of the Naraki Desert.  Located to the east
of the path lies a sandstone castle of colossal size and architectural
complexity.  Towers rise off the main castle wall at the corners of the
massive fortification.  Stained glass windows with frames of petrified
bark are set into both the castle and tower walls while the castle itself
is surrounded by a moat of brown silt.  The red granite blocks part
briefly at the entrance to the castle, right in front of an opaque glass
drawbridge.  Smaller, less grandiose castles of sand stand among the
dunes along the western horizon.

E
opaque glass drawbridge~
Forged from melted sand, the castle's drawbridge is one solid piece of
thick glass.  The glass is opaque and framed in heavy bronze.  Upon the
center of the drawbridge is a coat of arms.  The drawbridge appears to
some how lower, providing a bridge for the moat of brown silt encircling
the castle.
~
E
stained glass windows~
The stained glass windows are composed of slim ingots of colored red,
black, blue, clear, and tan glass which have been pinched between bronze
framework patterns.  Predominant among the window glasses is a theme of
the ocean.  Within the patterns of glass strange, multi-colored fish and
grasses swim through watery depths.
~
E
walls castle~
The walls of the castle stand tall and wide, topped by dovetailing
parapets.  The surface of the walls have a glossy look to them which is a
result of a special resin which has been used to coat its surface. 
Instead of being built out of individual blocks of stone, the red, sandy
walls are sculpted from the sands of the desert itself and hardened with
this resin.  Lines are engraved into the walls to give the illusion of
stone.
~
E
towers~
Towers of sculpted sand emerge from the corner walls of the grand
fortress The dimensions seem all wrong, however.  They seem too stilted
and flat to actually be part of the castle structure.
~
E
coat of arms~
A three-part coat of arms has been etched into the surface of the
drawbridge.  The first part consists of a shield bearing the emblem of a
pyramid.  Over the pyramid, forming the second part, rise great storm
clouds and a descending bolt of lightning.  To either side of the etched
pyramid, broken chains grasped in crabman claws make up the third part of
the emblem.
~
E
path blocks red granite~
Rectangular blocks of red granite demarcate a path through the red sand
desert, from north to south.  Each block has been polished and smoothed
and bears not a single blemish.
~
E
silt moat~
A sea of silt completely encircles the colossal sand castle, making
passage over its drawbridge the only possible way into it.  To either
side of the moat's shore stand feline statues.

To either side of where the drawbridge is suppose to come to rest on the

from opaque, black glass as shiny as obsidian and has tiny, pebble-sized

as they face outward, away from the castle protectively.  One of the

Red Desert Path~
Impenetrable and immense, the sheltering walls of the canyon loom
overhead to the east, its cliffs sloping inward towards the desert.  And
to the west, spiraling dunes of sand emerge from an otherwise flat,
scarlet plain of sand.  Between the two natural barriers runs a rough but
visible trail.  To either side of the trail stand blocks of red granite,
whose polished surfaces gleam.

E
canyon walls cliff~
The granite walls of the sunken valley lie just to the east.  The wall
here is so tall that cliffs are formed up above.  However, the canyon
walls slope inward, making scaling the cliffs an impossible feat.  In
places, the rough granite surfaces of the cliffs are tinged with red,
marking them as a probable source for the granite blocks lining the edges
of the desert path.
~
E
spiraling dunes~
Unlike barchan dunes whose sandy crescents dot the majority of the main
desert, the crimsons sand here spiral around a central column of sand,
creating a swirling design in the sandy canvas.  The dunes stand as tall
as a hundred or so feet, and oft block what lies beyond.  Between two of
the slimmer spiral dunes, though, you can catch a glimpse of a red,
sandstone castle to the west!
~
E
polished granite blocks~
Each block has been cut with precision and in the exact same shape and
size as the one next to it.  These rectangular blocks border the edge of
a desert path which courses north to south through this red desert region. 
The path looks well maintained and traveled.

In the Center of the Red Desert Expanse~
Blood-red sand fills your gaze in every direction as rising dunes dot the
landscape.  Blocks of red granite, set in pairs, lie to the far east,
denoting a path through the desert.  Across from the path stands an
imposing castle.  Castles of sand lie in all other directions but they
are no where near as large or impressive as the easternmost one.  Swirls
of sand cascade over the surface of a stone formation to the near south.

Amidst Strange Sand Formations~
In most cases, the surrounding arid land is level and flat, with its
sands forming protective dunes around the area.  But here, the sands are
piled in miniature dunes and mounds and are wrought with strange designs
and shapes.  There are also a few statue-like sand sculptures as well,
rising up from the sand.  Each formation has a creative touch to it and
could not have been formed by nature alone.  The walls of a large,
sandstone castle lie to the south and southeast.

The miniature dunes appear to have been carefully molded by hand.  They

~
E

Sculpted from sand, three statues stand here.  Each statue is nearly
perfect and looks to have been made with a child's attention to detail. 
The statues are all of crab people.  One appears to be wearing a crown,
one a diadem, and one carries a large polearm.
~

Many of the designs are geometric in origin.  But a few appear to be

The castle to the southeast has walls which adjoin the castle next to it. 
Both castles are identical in every respect, except for the numbers of
towers they have.  This one has four towers.

Inside a Small Sand Castle~
The first thing you notice about the inside of this small sand castle is
the incredible amount of heat confined within the room.  The walls are
coated with a sooty fill.  In the center of the room, taking center
stage, stands a huge fire pit and forge.  Unlike a metalworking forge,
this one seems to be suited for only forging and blowing glass.  A giant
bellows lies at the foot of the fire pit, as does a basin filled with
some black rocks and dried reeds.  Beside the forge stands a
sand-sculpted rack.  A column of wispy smoke rises from the fiery pit to
escape through an opening in the ceiling.  The walls of this chamber are
unadorned, save for a single tapestry which has been fastened to the
north wall.  To the east stands what looks like a drawbridge made of
woven grasses.

E
fire pit forge~
Surrounded by rock and melted sand, a large pit is sunk into the floor. 
The pit is filled with burning black stone and dried reeds, which give
off an incredible amount of heat.  The heat seems to conduct itself up a
column of stone rises up out of the center of the pit.  There are a
couple of hollow cubbies in the column, suggestive of miniature kilns. 
The top of the column looks smooth enough to be able to turn or spin
glass on.
~
E
bellows~
A giant bellows fashioned from bits of hardened leather and bone stands
at the base of the forge.  With but a few pumps from this large bellows,
any fire could probably be stoked.
~
E
rack sand-sculpted~
This rack stands about four feet tall and holds a variety of tools.  Its
red, sandy material has been covered with clear resin to help it maintain
its shape.
~
E
tools variety~
A variety of tools, most of which you cannot put a name to, stand or lean
up against the rack.  Most of the tools seem like they would prove useful
in forging or blowing glass sculptures.
~
E
reeds black rocks basin~
The basin beside the forge is made of a dark, smoky glass and has a
series of imperfections running through it.  Inside the basin, there are
chunks of hard black rock and cut sections of an extremely woody reed. 
Both the reeds and the stone look like they might burn well.
~
E
hole ceiling~
The hole in the ceiling allows all the smoke to escape from the fire pit
and forge.  It is rimmed with a heavy layer of black soot.
~
E
tapestry~
The tapestry hanging on the northern wall has been coated with the same
clear resin that the walls have been treated with.  It is made from high
quality, woven threads and the dyes and embroidery upon the tapestry are
extraordinary.  The tapestry depicts a creature with a body of stone,
wings, claws, and a grim but apathetic look.  In one hand the creature
holds a balance, while in the other he holds an anvil.  All in all, the
fine tapestry looks out of place in this sandy abode.
~
E
woven drawbridge~
Piles of dried brown desert grass have been tightly banded together with
strips of hide to form a working drawbridge.  The surface of the gate
shines and has been lavished with several heavy coats of clear, hardening
resin.  The massive gate is set into the east wall and appears to have an
actual, working mechanism which lowers and raises the drawbridge.  There
is also a bar which can slide back into the wall mounted on the
drawbridge, so that the gate can be held against invaders.

Before Two Castles of Sand~
A plain of red sand, hot as burning coals and red as blood stretches out
before you and beyond to the east.  The arid land undulates as dunes of
sand rise and fall across its surface.  Ascending out of the sands,
though, stand two castles.  Each castle is built entirely from sand and
stands of near-equal height.  Their walls have the look of being built
from individual blocks of cut, red sandstone and gleam with a wet look. 
The castle of sand to the west has short, stocky battlements and spindly
minarets rising off its sides.  The castle which stands adjacent to it,
though, has simpler walls and towers.  A drawbridge of woven grass is set
into the small castle to the west while a mass of beaten chitin lies up
against the castle of sand to the north.  The top of a squat tower can be
seen to the south.  In the distance, to the northwest, you can see the
tip of a very large pyramid rising above the castles.

[Ssleestaq] should be stretches out to the east and south, the 'you' implies i'm facing south which is damned odd.
[Ssleestaq] smartass :P perhaps you should knock.

E
squat tower~
To the far south stands a squat tower sculpted from sand.  It has no
windows or apparent doors that you can see, but it does seem to be a
purposefully constructed building.
~
E
l west~
The castle of sand which rises to the west is small but detailed.  It has
short, stocky battlements and blood-red minarets branching off of its
side towers.  The castle has no windows, but it does possess a drawbridge
of tightly woven grass.  A plume of smoke rises up from the center of the
castle's roof.
~
E
1 north~
Modest both in design and size, the castle of sand which stands to the
north has no windows and but two towers.  The castle's front is graced by
simple arches and modest pieces of statuary.
~
E
mass beaten chitin~
The mass of chitin shell set into the front of the castle has been
hammered into a roughly rectangular shape.  Attached to the chitin is a
strip of hardened leather, like a handle.  The hammered mass, on closer
inspection, is a swinging door.
~
E
grass woven drawbridge~
Bound together with strips of leathery hide, sections of long-stemmed,
desert grass have been woven together into a drawbridge.  Judging from
the chains hanging down on either side of the gate, it looks serviceable. 
Perhaps you should knock?
~
E
walls blocks red sandstone ~
On closer examination, the walls of the sand castles are not built from
blocks of sand stone.  Rather, the castles have been sculpted by hand. 
Lines carefully drawn into the sand gives the appearance of individual
stone blocks.  Every surface has been coated with a thick, clear resin
which lets the sand maintain its shape.
~
E
modest statuary~
The statuary out front of the sand castle to the north consists of a few
simple sandstone sculptures of miniature crabs.  The crab statuary rests
on the ground, all around the base of the castle.
~
E
pyramid monument tip~
A pyramidal structure looms to the northwest.  Its polished, pale-green
limestone practically gleams.  Along the upper part of the pyramid, near
the tip, you can barely discern several tracks of hieroglyphics.

Within the Modest Sand Castle~
The inside of this sand castle resembles only partially what one might
expect the interior architecture to look like.  The resin-coated walls of
red sand have been etched with lines to give the appearance of blocks of
stone and the floor has been covered with a pigmented resin, to give it a
green, marbleized look.  A few tattered tapestries hang from the walls of
the castle, as well as a mantle which protrudes over a small fireplace. 
Heaps of sand shaped closely to beds rest towards the back of the
chamber, near the fireplace.  All in all, this abode looks quite modest. 
Set into the south wall is a beaten door made of chitin.

This long, slender plank of petrified wood spans one side of the wall to

The fireplace is little more than a few crude rocks stack up on one
another to create a bowl in which flammable fuels may be placed.  A
column of hollowed out sand rises up above the fireplace as a makeshift
chimney.  Mounted on the chimney wall, there is a plank of petrified wood
acting as a mantle.
~
E
blue-green stain floor **M**~
While the floor has been covered with a deep green, hardening resin, to
help it keep its shape and to retain a color other than red, its surface
is marred by a blue-green stain which spreads over the surface of it. 
The stain looks to be a couple of days old, and smells like rotten fish. 
Or crab.
~
E
walls **M**~
The walls of the castle are coated with a thick but unusual resin which
keeps them hardened and weather-proofed.  A few splattered stains, of the

places.
~
E
door beaten chitin~
Constructed from the shells of crab people, this door is sturdy and thick. 
The beaten plates which compose the door are of a dark orange color and
have been cured to prevent drying or cracking.  While the door lacks a
sophisticated locking mechanism, it does indeed have a bar which can be
dropped across the inside of the door, to prevent it from opening.

Outside of a Plain-looking Sand Castle~
The dry, arid terrain of the red desert extends to the south.  A
collection of dunes soar one atop the other to the west, blocking all but
the barest glimpse of a north to south trail.  But while seemingly
boundless desert expands to the south, here stands a sandstone castle. 
The castle has no windows or towers; rather, it is but a simple fort
complex with sturdy walls.  A slab of petrified tree bark lies up against
the front of the castle.  To the east, nearly adjoining the walls of the
plain sandstone castle, looms a large but still modest sandstone
construction.

Bordered to either side by blocks of smooth, polished granite, a trail
winds itself through the desert, taking a north-south path at the eastern
edge of the canyon.  The trail looks moderately traveled from what you
can see from your present vantage.
~
E
slab petrified tree bark 1 north~
Cut at one time from a giant and ancient tree, this slab of bark has
since undergone petrification.  Rectangular in shape, the slab of bark
lies up against the face of the castle, like a door.  The slab is
actually a fashioned cross-section of a tree, and rings can clearly be
seen in the brown-black bark.
~
E

One hundred.  Two hundred.  Three hundred.  After counting as many as
four hundred rings upon the surface of this slab of bark, you grow weary
with determining its age.  Needless to say, it is old.
~
E
walls~
Though the castle lacks battlements or towers, it does have small,
exterior walls which merge with the castle itself.  Mounds of sand litter
the base of the castle walls.
~
E
mounds sand~
Piles of red sand gather in heaps along the base of the castle walls.  At
one spot, the sand appears to be obscuring something beneath the wall.
~
E
castle~
The castle which stands to the north rises maybe forty feet tall.  It has
no windows or battlements or even a drawbridge.  In fact, there does not
seem to be a way into the castle.  The exterior of the castle gleams
faintly, like no sandstone should.
~
E
sandstone~
The sandstone which comprises the bulk of what the plain castle to the
north is built from is, in fact, not sandstone at all.  As you run your
eyes over its surface, you can see traces of an external resin, which has
been applied to the castle.  The clear resin serves, as it seems, the
purpose of hardening the sand to which it has been applied.  The castle
before you is really a sand castle, built entirely of sand.

Within a Sand-filled Tunnel~
Sculpted in the same manner as the castles of sand which stand in the red
desert, a tunnel extends to the east from the secret opening behind the
dais.  The tunnel is taller than you might have expected, but a lot
grimier too.  The walls are coated with a thin layer of slime and there
are a couple of piles of bones stacked up along the floor.  On the floor,
there is a large, metallic basin and set into the side wall is a length
of iron chain.  From here, you can see that the tunnel does not extend
much beyond this point.

While there are no hints of this secret tunnel on the other side, here

E
walls slime layer **M**~
As you examine the walls, you make two startling discoveries.  The first,
is that the slime coating the walls smells more than yesterday's dung
heap.  The second, is that the walls are not coated with slime, but
instead, saliva.
~
E
basin water **M**~
The metallic basin at your feet is made of steel and has been bolted down
to the floor.  The content of the basin looks to be water, but it is so
cloudy and unappealing that you don't think drinking it would be such a
good idea.  Along the side of the water basin, there is a panel of etched
hieroglyphics.
~
E
length iron chain~
Securely fastened to the wall is a length of iron chain which hangs
limply to the ground.  Around the chain fastener there are deep gouges in
the hard, packed sand and crimson stains are smeared over some of them.
~
E
crimson stains **M**~
The crimson stains are indeed streaks of blood and a couple of them look
fairly recent too.

Red Desert Path~
Bordered on either side by blocks of polished red granite, a trail winds
north to south through the red desert.  Dunes of impenetrable sand loom
along the edge of the canyon to the east while to the south, you see the
walls of some type of structure, possibly that of a castle.  To the south
you can also see the tops of similar, castle-shaped structures.  There is
also something strange about the sand to the south that might need
further investigation.

Nearly identical in every respect, square blocks of red granite rise up

Indeed, off in the distance, you can see the battlements, parapets, and

normal castles, these castles nevertheless look real.  The architecture
from castle top to castle top differs as greatly as two blades of grass.

Inside a Plain-looking Sand Castle~
The interior of the rather ordinary castle of sand is as plain as its
outside architecture.  The walls and floor are formed from hard-packed
red sand while the ceiling rises inward, creating a dome.  From the
center of the domed ceiling hangs a crude, but serviceable lantern. 
Along the floor of the castle, there are several piles of loose sand,
some of which have depressions in them.  A slab of petrified tree bark
stands against the wall to the south.

walls **M**~
Sculpted from the bright red sands of the desert here, the walls remind
you of barriers of blood.  The walls appear to be coated with some type
of clear, hardening resin, to help them keep their shape.
~
E
lantern serviceable **M**~
The lantern hanging from the ceiling appears to have been, at one time, a
work of art as well as a light source.  By now, the delicate brass
filigree spiraling off its corners are covered in green corrosion.  You
notice, though, that the oil the lantern burns for fuel is smokeless.
~
E
domed ceiling~
With its highest point being in the middle of the sandy room, the ceiling
arcs slowly to create a dome over the room.  From the center of the dome,
a slender chain has been bolted into the ceiling, from which hangs the
lantern.  A few cracks run through the dome, but they look to have been
recently patched up with globs of resin and handfuls of sand.
~
E
piles loose sand **M**~
In a few places inside the castle, piles of sand rest upon the floor. 
The piles vary in side and shape, but generally, most are about twice as
big around as a barrel of stout ale.  Depressions mar the surface of a
couple of the piles, as though something had been recently sitting upon
them.
~
E
depressions **M**~
The depressions in the sand look as though the crab people of this small
community use these piles of sand as both their chairs and their beds.
~
E
slab petrified tree bark~
Hard as a rock and just as big, the stab of wood standing against the
south wall has been petrified from quite some time.  It is hard to tell
what type of tree the wood once came from, probably an oak or an elm. 
The left edge of the slab is attached to interior hinges and the door
appears to be equipped with a crude bar lock.

Inside the Colossal Castle~
Behind a door of opaque glass set into the west wall spreads a vast room. 
While the interior of this sand castle lacks many of the fascinating
architectural feats the exterior displayed, it nevertheless has a charm
all its own.  A tattered but serviceable rug stretches from the threshold
to a dais, upon which stands a throne of sparkling glass.  Hung upon the
sandy walls are a variety of tapestries and rough sketches.  At each
corner of the sand-sculpted chamber, there are small iron braziers.

E
opaque door **M**~
Though opaque, you can tell from the glare and the door's texture that
someone has managed to forge glass into a sheet large enough and thick
enough to use as a door to ones abode.  The door has a faint, reddish
cast to it and has been made in the shape of a drawbridge.
~
E
variety tapestries~
The tapestries are made of woven grasses which have been either dyed or
pigmented in some way.  Most of the tapestries consists of nothing more
than everyday scenes of life that the crab people living in this part of
the Naraki Desert share.
~
E
scenes everyday life~
In the first scene, two larger, older looking craw people busy themselves
with watching over a pack of smaller crabs.  In the second, a crab person
is sitting atop a dune of sands, strumming a stringed-instrument with its
claw.  In the third, a robust crabman stands over a hot forge, with a
hammer in one hand and what looks to be an ingot in the other.  In the
final scene, a pair of crab people, identical in every respect, stand
beneath the two moons and a dim aura of light surrounds them.
~
E
sketches~
There are two sketches, both of which represent the same thing, but from
different angles.  Each sketch is a diagrammed representation of the
construction of a vast pyramidal structure.  The diagrams are drawn upon
sheets of beaten papyrus paper with pieces of charcoal and look
relatively well preserved.  The only thing which belies their age are the
cracked, upturned corners of the second diagram.
~
E
diagrammed representations~
The sketches are divided into several sections, with each section
depicting yet another stand in the structure's completion.  From the
underground foundation, to its tip, from its base to its limestone
sheathing, every step of the pyramid's construction has been carefully
documented.  Prominent in both diagrams is the use of crabmen as slaves
and laborers.
~
E
cracked upturned corners **M**~
The resin applied to the surface of the sketched diagrams appears to have
broken down at the corners of the second sketch.  This is probably
because the second section of sketched papyrus is almost twice as thick
as the first.
~
E
dais **M**~
The creatures who constructed this place have a knack for sculpted sand
into the shapes they desire and for making the sand harden.  The dais
stands at the edge of the long rug which extends towards the doorway.  It
is round in shape and stands only a foot or two off the ground.  The
dais, like the walls, ceiling and floor of the sand castle, is sculpted
from red sand.  Atop the raised platform sits a throne made entirely of
glass.
~
E
throne **M**~
Made entirely of glass, an ornate throne sits atop the sculpted sand dais. 
Unlike the opaque door of glass which serves as the drawbridge to the
castle, the glass the throne is made from is clear as crystal and not
solely red in color.  Each section of the throne has been forged from a
different color of class.  The arms of the throne are clear, the seat of
the throne is red, the base and sides of the throne are a light brown,
and the back of the throne is of a rich blue.  The surfaces of the throne
are etched with indecipherable glyphs and symbols.
~
E
rug~
Woven from thin strands of grass and plant fibers, this old and tattered
rug stretches the length of the room.  Though the edges are worn and the
dyes are faded, you can still see the sharp, geometric patterns which
adorn the narrow carpet.
~
E
geometric patterns~
The geometric patterns consists of a series of concentric squares,
circles, and triangles.  Each of the patterns seems to revolve around one
large triangle, which is situated at the center of the rug.
~
E
center triangle~
At the center of the rug, there is a triangle about a foot long.  Around
it, a multitude of geometric patterns spawn across the surface of the rug
wildly.  The pigments on and around the triangle are heavily worn, as
though people stand in this spot more oft than not to address their
grievances to the occupant of the throne.

Desert Path Fringed with Red Sand~
As the desert path stretches through the desert, bullied on either side
by large dunes of sand, the north-south path begins to change.  Red sand
the color of bramberries intermingles and slowly takes the place of the
tan sands of the desert altogether and the irregularly placed stones
which once marked the edges of the desert pass are there no longer.  In
their place, at regular intervals stand rectangular blocks of red granite. 
The path continues to the south and back to the north.

E
dunes ~
The dunes which stand to either side of the desert path block most of the
view in either direction.  But from what you can see, a colossal pyramid
dominates the landscape to the west.  To the east, the valley-canyon
which encircles most of the Naraki desert encroaches.  Patches of desert
grass struggle for nutrients along the sides and surfaces of the dunes.
~
E
patch grass sides surfaces~
Patches of brown, desert grass which has adapted remarkably well to the
harsh climate, stick up out of the sandy dunes.  The majority of the
grass has taken root along the side of the western dune, at the edges of
some chunks of rock.
~
E
chunks rock~
Several chunks of rock have been set into the side of the western dune
and judging from the looks of things, they have been there from some time. 
The grasses have grown over the rocky chunks almost entirely in a few
spots, where the rocks seem the loosest.
~
E
sand~
The sands of the Naraki are an amazing thing.  Part tan and part red, the
sandy path stretching to the south undergoes a drastic change.  While it
is not uncommon for the presence of varying sediments to slightly alter
the color of nearby sands, the stark contrast been dull brown and
brilliant red is a bit unnerving.
~
E
granite red blocks~
The blocks of red granite each stand about two feet above your waist and
have been cut with precision and artificially polished.  Rather than
being engraved with runes or hieroglyphics, the blocks of granite are
smooth and unadorned.

Den of Snakes~
Set into the side of a very large dune of sand lies a small space lined
with bits of stone and dried desert grass.  Strips of rough, leathery
paper rest on the ground near your feet next to broken shards of something
white and fragile.  A network of grass roots holds together a ceiling of
sand above your head.  Chunks of rock jut inward out of the eastern side
of the hollow.

Desert Path~
All around you, you can see heat visibly rising up off the searing, tan
sand.  Across the barren sea of desolation, there is very little
vegetation or life to be found.  A massive stone structure, pyramidal in
shape, looms to the west like a giant mountain.  Bordered irregularly by
rough grey granite chunks, a thin trail extends from north to south, with
a parting path east.

Southwest of a Broken Obelisk~
With dunes of sand rising and falling like sweeping ocean waves, it is
difficult to discern true distances in this hot, arid land.  There is no
water or flora in sight.  For that matter, as far as the eye can see,
there is nothing but sand and rock.  The sole exception to this is the
remains of a tall, pillar of stone which has long since toppled and
crumbled to pieces.  The ruinous structure lies to the northeast.  A path
around the broken monument stretches to the north and east.

Ruins on the Desert Path~
Irregularly spaced bits of stone and rock lie to either side of a path
which extends north to south through the desert.  A thick column of stone
and a wide granite slab lie across the path, blocking most of it. 
Another column of stone rises from the sand opposite the fallen pieces,
unaffected by their toppling.  The immense stone pyramid at the center of
the canyon looms just to the west while there seems to be a crude wooden
corral to the east.

column~
There are two columns of pale orange stone.  One stands upright, right at

somehow fallen, along with the slab of granite that must have once been
suspended between the two.  Both columns are heavily scratched, as though
they have been defaced.
~
E
slab granite~
The rectangular slab of granite which lies on the desert path must have,
at one time, been suspended over the path between the two columns like a
framed doorway.  The stone has been expertly cut, for its edges are
smooth and exact.  Along the underbelly of the slab, which lies partially
exposed there are a couple of hieroglyphics tracks.

The Greened Way - Near a Landslide~
Though a few trees and a couple of bushes grow along the sides of the
road, the vegetation appears to be thinning and dying along its western
edges.  Several boulders and tons of black earth form a landslide to the
east, cutting off the rest of Greened Way.  The terrain to the north and
south is rough and rocky, making travel in either direction unlikely. 
Greened Way continues unimpeded to the west, though the ground is much
more uneven.

South of a Broken Obelisk~
The fallen ruins of a once massive monument of stone lies in the sand to
the far north.  It is apparent that the structure has been lying in a
broken heap for some time, for there are dunes of sand and wind-blown
debris gathered along side it.  Between the canyon wall and the tall,
barchan dunes which dot the arid landscape, there is a fairly even path,
which skirts around the collapsed monument to the north.

Near a Broken Obelisk~
To the far west rises the impressive, solitary figure of a giant stone
pyramid.  Closer, still, though, to the north, lies a obelisk of stone
which has fallen into the sand below.  The obelisk looks to be from
similar origins as the great pyramid, though its exterior has not the
same brilliant gleam.  The sheer canyon wall to your east eliminates any
possibility of climbing up and getting a better view of the desert.

Hundreds of feet long, a charred and broken obelisk lies in the sand,
partly buried.  While much of the colossal monument is intact, large
sections of its surface have fractured away from it.  Many of the
fractured pieces of stone lie to the east, in the direction of the
obelisk's fall.  The tip of the obelisk also lies to the east.  An
enormous hill of tan sand looms to the west, casting shadows over the

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
From here, you have a head-on look down the length of a fallen obelisk,
from tip to base.  Though large sections of the monument are covered with
sand, the exposed portions reveal many things.  Even at the tip, where it
is the most narrow, the obelisk is still several times your size.  Sheets
of limestone sheath the pyramidal tip of the obelisk and a few fragments
continue to cling to its upper portion.  Fragments of stone lie scattered
everywhere, having somehow fractured off.  To the west and north lies a
slim stretch of desert which surrounds the charred and cracked monument.

The pyramid-shaped tip of the obelisk is still covered with polished,

is pock-marked and warped.
~
E
obelisk monument~
Though you cannot tell for certain what purpose this monument served or
how it came to be in such a state, you do notice how odd it seems that
nearly every trace of hieroglyphic writing which once adorned its
exterior has fractured or melted away from the core structure.  Only a
few hieroglyphs remain on its surface.
~
E
broken stone~
Many of the stone fragments dispersed around the tip of the obelisk are
melted and fractured pieces of limestone, which undoubtedly once covered
at least the upper section of the tall stone pillar.  Other some bits
found within the area are sections of stone once composing the surface of
the quarry stone blocks this obelisk had been erected from.
~
E
portions exposed~
The portions of the obelisk which remain above the desert's sandy depths
add disturbing thoughts to your mind.  From the black scorch marks along
much of the obelisk, you can tell something very hot and intense struck
the obelisk.  This fiery blast was enough not only to knock the obelisk
over, but to also flay the stone off much of its surface.  You also find
it quite odd that even though the obelisk was struck by such a force,
that its core remains intact.

To the west lies the ruins of a tall, tapering monument, which must have
stood nearly a third as tall as the great pyramid itself.  While cracks
run up and down the surface of the obelisk, much of its core stone is
intact.  It appears that the impact of the fall only served to chip away
at the surface faces of the pillar.  Caught between the obelisk and the
canyon to the east, the desert twists between the two, running a north to
south course. The tip of the obelisk lies here and just to the south.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
To the southwest lies the fallen remains of a giant obelisk built from
pale orange quarry stone.  At some point, it appears the pillar of stone
broke from its foundation to the far west and toppled southeast into the
desert sands.  Parts of the obelisk lie buried beneath the sand while
other parts are fully exposed.  Fragments of stone lie everywhere.  The
desert here is not much more than a narrow strip of sand curving between
the fallen obelisk and the canyon which forms both a northern and eastern
barrier.

obelisk~
Here, you can see almost the full length of the obelisk, or at least what
remains, for it is apparent that a significant portion of the tapering
pillar of stone lies buried beneath the sand.  From base to tip, the
obelisk was probably no more than a third of the height of the great
pyramid to the west.  At one time, the upper third of the carved stone
was sheathed in limestone and the rest of its surface was decorated with
intricate hieroglyphics, of which, only a few remain.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
The remains of a once tall obelisk now lies in ruins in the sand here. 
Bits and pieces of the obelisk are scattered everywhere, dispersed by its
tragic fall.  The majority of the stone pillar is intact and buried
beneath the sand it would appear.  Thousands of tiny fragments lie about,
scattered in the direction of the fall.  To the west you can see the
obelisk's crumbling foundation and to the south you can barely make out a
portion of the tip of the obelisk.  A swath of desert extends around
between the canyon and the obelisk.

foundation~
To the west, the charred and crumbling foundation of the obelisk can be
seen.  You cannot make out much detail, only that it looks like nothing
natural caused the obelisk to fall.
~
E
canyon~
Here, the canyon keeps a fairly straight path, traveling east to west. 
But to the far east, the canyon turns sharply to the south and appears to
head in that direction for quite some time.
~
E
tip~
From what you can glimpse of the tip of the obelisk, it lies a good
distance to the south and is sheathed, at least partially, in the same
type of smooth, polished limestone as the great pyramid to the west.
~
E
obelisk~
Little of the obelisk's surface remains intact, though before its fall
every inch of it much have been covered with hieroglyphics.  Now, only a
handful of hieroglyphics can be seen along its surface.  Much of the
obelisk lies buried in the churning tan sands of the desert.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
Directly to the southeast lies a tapered, rectangular stone carving. 
Made of pale orange quarry stone, the obelisk lies in many pieces on its
side, having at some point broken from its foundation and shattering as
it impacted the ground.  The tip of the obelisk presumably is somewhere
to the southeast, in the direction that the stone pillar fell.  Between
the canyon to the north and the rising sand dunes, the desert arcs in a
broad path around the fallen pillar of stone to the east and south.

E
pillar stone obelisk~
Much of the tapering pillar of stone has been destroyed, either by
whatever caused its fall in the first place or the fall itself.  Chunks
of stone lie spread across quite a large area southeast of its broken
foundation.  The bottom of the obelisk is jagged and crumbling,
indicating that its destruction occurred a long time ago.  A lot of the
pillar's exterior has been eroded by wind.  Be that as it may, you can
still make out a few traces of hieroglyphics amidst the cracked and
charred surface of some of the obelisk's many pieces.
~
E
foundation~
The foundation of stone where the obelisk was once firmly attached is
cracked and charred, as though it were struck with a massive bolt of
lightning.  Parts of the stone have begun to crumble and flake, but the
sections which are intact bear distinctive hieroglyphics.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
There are two series of hieroglyphics.  One set adorn the crumbling
remains of the obelisk's base while the other adorn the faces of the
obelisk itself.
~
E
tip~
You cannot see the tip of the obelisk from here.  But judging from the
size of what you can see, the top of the obelisk must lie a few hundred
feet to the southeast.

Path Around a Broken Obelisk~
Just to the east lies a tapered column of stone roughly a third as long
as the pyramid to the west is tall.  The large obelisk remains mostly
intact but partly buried beneath the ever shifting sands.  Fragments of
it, particularly pieces of its surface, rest in a scattered mess all
around the obelisk, in the direction in which it fell.  To the north, you
can see the cracked and crumbling foundation the obelisk must have once
stood upon and to the west lies a macabre trail through the exposed
skeleton of some titanic creature.

path~
The path to the east looks to be just a continuation of the narrow desert
path which travels through this area of the desert.  But instead of being
outlined by marker stones, it appears that it was deemed just as
efficient to use the ribs of the skeleton to guide the path.
~
E
foundation~
The foundation of stone at one time provided a base for a colossal stone
pillar that now stands in ruins to the north.  Most of its surface is
blackened and cracked.  Where it is not, the stone is crumbling.  Many of
the bits of stone strewn about are jagged and charred, as if some hot and
powerful force was brought to bear over every little piece.  A few of the
stone pieces looked to have once been awash in carved hieroglyphics, but
their surfaces are all but illegible now.

Desert Path~
The skeleton of a gigantic creature lies stretched before you and
continues back to the south.  Its skull, fully as big as you, points to
the north, its jaw agape.  The bones of its many-jointed neck curves in a
sweeping 'S' shape in the tan sands.  The back bone of the creature lies
buried beneath the sand, but its exposed ribs jut straight upwards. 
Rather than side stepping the huge skeleton, the desert path continues
straight through its center, using the rib bones as macabre path markers. 
To the east, where there are fewer dunes, you can see the fallen ruins of
a colossal stone pillar.

skull~
The skull of this mammoth creature has an elongated snout, a wide cranial
area, and jutting horn bones.  Though many of its teeth are missing, the
few that remain are yellow, cracked, and very sharp-looking.  The most
unusual thing about the skull is that, no matter which way you turn, you
have the oddest sensation that you are being watched from its empty
sockets.
~
E
rib bones path~
Through the center of the gigantic skeleton's ribs, the desert path
continues to run to the south.  But instead of using bits of stone and
rock for boundary markers, it appears that the ribs of the creature have
been made to act as substitutes.  Each rib in the skeleton is fully three
times your height and size.  The entire ribcage stretches outward to the
south, where there appear to be other bones which are not as intact.
~
E
neck~
The neck vertebrae of this creature are large and numerous.  In respect
to its body, the neck is at least as long.  A couple of the neck bones
towards the middle are chipped and broken while others have signs of
having been cracked and healed while the creature was alive.

Desert Path~
Under the lingering presence of the immense stone pyramid to the west,
you cannot help but feel self-conscious of every move you make through this
desert domain.  Rising dunes with graceful crescent shapes spread
throughout the desert, inhibiting travel to the east.  Edged by bits of
stone and rock, a narrow trail heads north to south, providing a perfect
path throughout the arid wasteland.  At one point along the path two
columns, one to either side, and a slab of stone rests atop them like a
plank.

have been designed to support the slab of stone suspended between the two
of them.
~
E
slab~
Its weight distributed between the two columns, this slab of granite
rests a good forty or fifty feet in the air.  Coupled with the twin
columns, the slab helps to frame a make-shift threshold or doorway
through which, however, there is only more desert.  Along the edges of
the slab, there seem to be some glyphs.
~
E
path trail~
The desert path outlined by irregularly placed bits of rock and stone
shows some signs of recent travel.  There are several sets of tracks in
the sand, as well as a couple of piles of semi-fresh dung.  Most of the
tracks, though, seem to end at the threshold of the twin columns.

Desert Path~
Except to the east, where an unusually large dune rises up, the desert
lies travelable in all directions.  The most unusual feature about this
stretch of arid wasteland is that a small desert trail runs right through
the center of a gigantic skeleton.  In through its ribcage and out
through its pelvis bone, the path runs an efficient though macabre course
through the creature's fallen body from north to south.  A hot breeze
blows quietly through the area, stirring up sand with its to the hazy-red
sand storm lingering on the southern horizon.  To the west looms the
ominous stone megalith of a pyramid.

path~
The only thing not quite right about the desert path heading north and
south here is that it runs straight through the ribcage of a gigantic,
deceased creature.  Instead of using rocks and stone for markers, the
trail maker simply designated the rib bones of the skeleton to be such. 
(It is not like the creature was using its ribcage any more, now is it?)

~
E
creature skeleton~
The skeletal remains of the colossal creature are remarkably well intact. 
Though you cannot be certain due to most of it being buried in the sand,
you might hazard to guess that the entire skeletal structure is still
there, lying where the creature fell however many years ago.

Sand-Filled Canyon~
The canyon walls loom above your head as the canyon proceeds to run an
east-west course.  Sand the color of dried dung fills the canyon to the
point that there is no other visible ground besides that which is covered
by sand.  The canyon twists and turns like a wounded sidewinder snake. 
Atop the edges of the canyon walls stand assorted rocks and boulders,
some of which look like the could fall at any second.

Balanced precariously along the top edges of the canyon are several

canyon walls twisting~
Twisting to and fro on an east-west course, the sandstone canyon walls
meander like a river.  Caught between their looming masses is an area of
ground whose surface has been completely covered with sand.  Upwards,
atop the canyon walls, you can see a few rocks and sandstone boulders,
each of which look dangerously close to falling.
~
E
sand dried dung~
Atop the sand that covers the canyon floor are small, rising mounds of
accumulated sand.  Dunes of tan-colored sand in the shape of crescent
moons lie scattered across the canyon's sandy surface.  Every now and
again, a tiny dust devil kicks up the sand, sending it swirling about.

To the west, a series of three inter-linked barchan dunes lie against the
eastern base of the giant stone pyramid.  Directly opposite the dunes, to
the far east, stretches a gruesome trail crossing lengthwise through the
ribcage of a giant skeleton.  To the south, the tan-colored sands of the
desert slope downward, creating a bowl in the sand.  Several bunches of
grass grow within the shallow depression.

Eastern Side of a Spectacular Pyramid~
You stand at the base of the colossal stone pyramid which seems to rest
in the exact heart of the desert-filled canyon.  Here, and to the south,
the sandy dunes which usually hug the base of the pyramid are absent.  In
their place rises part of the surrounding canyon.  Gleaming yellow-green
limestone covers nearly the entire structure, except for a few places
along the base where the quarry stone blocks of the titanic edifice have
been revealed.  Off in the distance to the east, you can see the fallen
remains of an obelisk.

Outside of a Corral~
Built into the side of an extremely large barchan dune, the impromptu
animal pen looks large enough to hold eight to ten fairly large animals.
A wooden gate with a crude latching mechanism encloses the pen.  Just to
the right of the gate, there is a small wooden bench sitting under a
makeshift awning.

E
awning~
Suspended from three pieces of wood lodged into the sand, a piece of
tattered cloth flaps in the desert breeze.  The cloth is thin and faded,
and has several holes in its fabric.  Nevertheless, it provides enough
shade for any sitting on the bench.
~
E
pen~
Though crude, the wooden livestock pen has been built in a simple fashion. 
It uses the back of a sand dune as one of its walls, and as support for
an overhanging roof which covers a third of the pen, providing shelter
the animals during the worst times of day.  Within the pen, you can see
stacks of hay, a trough filled with liquid, and a fire pit dug deep into
the ground.
~
E
gate latching mechanism~
The wooden gate to the pen is held together with strips of leather and
bits of wire.  It uses thick leather strips for hinges and has an unusual
latching mechanism fashioned from a corroding brass plate and a
crook-shaped piece of wire.
~
E
bench~
The small wooden bench resting under the awning is little more than a
plank of driftwood suspended between two blocks of rock.

Camel Corral~
Situated towards the eastern part of the Naraki desert, this partly
roofed area holds all that is necessary for keeping livestock. 
Half-rotten wooden planks and bits of driftwood have been messed together
with heavy woven grasses and pieces of wire to create a semi-sturdy pen. 
Piles of hay lie towards the back of the pen, next to a long, skinny
trough filled with water.  And as far away from the hay as possible,
there is a deep fire pit.  Near the latching gate to the pen are several
pegs, from which hang several objects.

E
gate latching~
The latching mechanism on the gate looks quite simple.  It is made up of
a beaten bronze plate which has corroded a nice green color and a piece
of bent wire.  Simple though it may be, it is sufficient for keeping any
dumb animal penned up.
~
E
hay~
Dry and lifeless, the piles of hay stacked at the back of the animal pen
look very tasty.  Yeah, right.  And Lord Richard does not know how to use
a shield and sword.  If you were an animal and had to eat this stuff, you
probably would not, especially if your life depended on it.
~
E
trough water~
Vile and murky, the only thing which can be said about the water in the
rotting wooden trough is that it is wet.
~
E
fire pit~
Dug deep into the ground and surrounded by chunks of rock, the fire pit
provides warmth without risking injury to the animals.  Some of the rock
chunks look to have once been part of some other, man-made construction,
for they bear designs.
~
E
designs~
The designs which are cut into the surfaces of a couple of the granite
rock chunks are ancient hieroglyphics.

Eastern Side of a Vast Pyramid~
To the east and south, the tan desert sands rise and fall like undulating
ocean waters.  But here, standing at the base of the greatest stone
construction you have ever seen, the sands are calm and relatively flat. 
The surface of the entire pyramid gleams brightly as the light reflects
off its pale yellow-green limestone sheathing.  At the pyramid's base, a
few pieces of limestone have fallen away, to reveal orange quarry stone
blocks beneath.

E
limestone surface~
The sections of limestone covering the surface of the pyramid is of a
pale, yellow-green color.  Polished smooth by wind and rain, the
limestone has the luster of a precious jewel.  Large portions of the
limestone, especially around the base, are caked with sand.  
~
E
base quarry blocks ~
Where pieces of limestone sheathing are missing, the heavy, immense
blocks of pale orange quarry stone are revealed.  Roughly trapezoidal in
shape, the blocks must weigh several tons.  Littering the ground along
the pyramid's base, there are several fragments of stone.
~
E
fragments stone~
Many of the stone fragments scattered near the base of the pyramid are
chunks of quarry stone and not the more valuable limestone.  From the
deep cut marks both in the base stones and in the fragments themselves,
it looks as though someone were trying to dig past the hieroglyphics
etched into the rock.  The only hieroglyphic tracks that remain intact
encircle part of the pyramid's tip.

Desert Path~
The desert broadens in every direction but the east.  Here, the twisting
bushes are surrounded, in an oval design, by a border of rocks, setting
the bushes apart from the desert like an island amidst the ocean waters. 
Two paths, which are also bordered by similar rocks, stream in from the
north and west, flowing around the bushes to merge into a single trail to
the south.

bushes~
There are two bushes marooned on the island of sand.  The first bush has
crescent-shaped leaves, red stems, and tiny purple berries. The second bush
has heart-shaped leaves twice the size of your hand, thick purple stems,
and a few pieces of luscious red fruit.
~
E
berries purple~
Hanging beneath some of the oval leaves of the first bush there are a few
ripe, purple berries.  The berries themselves have a glossy surface and
look very tasty.
~
E
fruit red ~
Only a couple pieces of red fruit dangle from the branches of the second,
more stout bush.  You doubt that it could support many more.  As red as
the setting sun and nearly as bright, the waxy-textured fruit looks very
tempting.
~
E
oval island~
The stones placed around the two bushes have been placed with the utmost
care and eye for artistic quality.  The oval is perfectly symmetric in
respect to the two bushes and the stones themselves are cut in uniform
shapes and sizes.
~
E
stones~
Each stone surrounding the island of bushes has been cut into the shape
of a rounded cylinder.  The stones are made of granite and have been
carefully smoothed.
~
E
trail path~
As the trail merges together from the north and west, to circle around
the two bushes in the center of this portion of the desert, the border
stones become more regularly shaped and spaced.  The exact placement of
the stones here, around the bushes and along the path, has meaning beyond
merely that of simply protecting the bushes.

Desert Expanse~
As you stand just east of the colossal stone behemoth that is the
pyramid, you cannot help but feel drawn to it.  But the tall, barchan
dunes to the west and north, too steep to climb, cut off access to the
pyramid.  Now and again, a violent gust of wind sweeps through the area,
kicking sand up into your eyes.  Yet more dunes lie to the south.  And to
the east, well within the boundaries of the twisting canyon, lies a path
bordered by ramshackle bits of stone.

Rising into the sky and looming ominously overhead stand a series of
crescent-shaped dunes.  The dunes surround you in all directions but the
north, which leads to a wider and flatter expanse of arid terrain.  The

southern barchan dunes, as if the desert has not had time to consume the

Desert Path~
Littered with pieces of driftwood, the desert trail which descends
through the area curves gently from the west to the south in a great arc. 
The trail is marked by irregularly placed stones at its fringes and has a
particularly tall stone at the apex of the arc.  A pair of short and
squat bushes can be seen growing to the south while to the north there is
nothing but the looming presence of a massive barchan dune.

The crescent-shaped barchan dune to the north is extremely tall and steep. 
So steep, in fact, that it is impassable.  Small foot prints dot the

small foot prints~
The small foot prints appear to end in claws.  Also, behind the prints

stone apex arc ~
At the apex of the curving trail, a particularly large stone stands at
its edge.  There are no markings on the stone or anything else unusual
about it.  Lying at the base of the stone, though, rests the still form
of a dead bird.
~
E
dead bird~
The small black bird sleeping the sleep of the dead here has only been
gone for a couple of hours, maybe a bit more.  Its body lies in a
crumbled mass, with its back arched and its neck thrust outward in an odd
angle, like it was seized by death suddenly.  Judging from its sleek
black feathers and bright orange beak, the bird appears to have been a
crow, a crow a long way from home.  Still clutched in the crow's claws
there is a sprig of something green.
~

Desert Path~
Though tall barchan dunes rise up tall and steep to both the northwest
and northeast, the desert elsewhere is relatively flat.  As the
rock-bordered trail runs its course from north to south like a meandering
river, the trail branches off to the east.  Both the main trail and its
tributaries are edged with erratically placed border stones.

Desert Path~
The desert spreads out in all directions but to the south, where a series
of three dunes rising side by side block the way.  While the desert path
curves from the north to the east, the great pyramid looming to the west
dominates.  All along the desert path, the recent passing of travelers
other than yourself can surely be seen.

perhaps horses, there are many sure signs that people other than yourself
have passed this way recently.

An Oasis~
Hidden within a pocket in the canyon, a cool and inviting oasis beckons
to you to have your fill of its lush waters.  The oasis consists of a
single pool with a spout of water gurgling upwards like a fountain. 
Gleaming white rocks encircle the edges of the pool providing a nice place
to sit and recuperate from the barren wasteland.  All around the rocks
grow a ring of palm trees, which cover the entire area with precious
shade.  The canyon wall to the west shows signs of a recent rockslide.

fountain pool water~
Gazing into the cool waters of the oasis, you can see tiny, fiery-red

Situated around the edge of the oasis there are numerous white stones
which gleam brightly in the light.  For the most part, the rocks look to
be composed of quartz.  But usually, not even quartz sparkles as brightly

A ring of palm trees grow around the oasis pool, providing more than

Pinched in on either side by barchan dunes, if you can call the near
endless expanses of desert between as such, the desert stretches openly
only to the south and north.  The same well-trodden path bordered by
irregularly placed rocks continues onward in these directions, providing
a marked trail.  There does not appear to be an end to the trail in sight, 
nor does there appear to be a way to reach the great megalith which is

Beneath a Sand Dune~
Little more than a slanted sinkhole, a tunnel of limestone rises upwards
to peak out at the base of a dune of sand.  The floor of the small cavern
is covered with loose sand and flecks of chipped limestone while the
walls have been smoothed by water erosion.  From the top of the cavern to
a gentle, sloping passage to the south, the cavern curves in a single,
graceful arc, from top to horizontal bottom.  Up and down the eastern
wall of the cavern, natural depressions resembling hand holds have eroded
into the pale green rock.

Inside a Broken Obelisk~
The interior of the broken obelisk is little more than a small, square
chamber with a curving, vaulted ceiling.  At one time, four marble
columns, one to every corner, stood, rising up to the ceiling as if to
hold the roof aloft.  But clearly, since all but one column is broken and
scattered about the floor in a thousand different pieces, the marble
pillars served only an ornamental function.  The walls of the quarry
stone chamber are all adorned with colorful panels of hieroglyphics,
though deep cracks tear through several of them, rendering them, for the
most part, illegible.

E
columns marble pillars~
The one remaining column has a cylindrical shaft of grey marble.  Both
its capital and its base, though, are hewn from a deeper grey marble,
which is almost black in color.  All three pieces of the column are
flecked with shiny, metal impurities.  Next to one of the broken columns
lies a brittle slab of rock.
~
E
metal impurities~
The flecks of metal riddling throughout the marble of the one remaining
column look to be pieces of silver or steel.  Otherwise, though, they are
simply impurities.
~
E
shattered pieces~
From what you can mentally reconstruct, given what remains of the other
three columns, each looked much the same as the one which still stands. 
Broken pieces of ash grey marble lie everywhere.  The deep cracks running
through the marble shirds are not localize, but rather spread all
throughout the shattered pieces.  This leads you to believe that some
natural force, perhaps an earthquake, caused their destruction.
~
E
ceiling~
The ceiling of this chamber vaults in such a way as to create a point
directly over the center of the chamber, and to give the ceiling's shape
a pyramidal look.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Numerous panels of hieroglyphics score the walls of the obelisk's
interior.  But sadly, the same force which demolished three of the four
marble columns in the chamber has also torn the surface off of most of
the panels, leaving them bare but for a few meaningless marks.  Out of
all the panels, only the third, eighth, and eleventh hieroglyphic panels
are completely intact.
~
E
walls 1 east~
Aside from being hewn from massive blocks of orange quarry stone and
fitted perfectly into place, there is little that is out of place among

Desert Path~
From north to south, a trail runs through the desert, kept in check by a
boundary of irregularly shaped and placed stones.  As the path goes
further south, there are increasingly frequent tracks in the sand. 
Though a series of tall, barchan dunes rise up to the west, the great
pyramid can still be seen.  Just east of the stone-edged path, the desert
branches off between two simple sandy mounds.  The sands to the east have
a distinctive ripple pattern about them.

sandy mounds~
Unlike the graceful, crescent-shaped barchan dunes that are
characteristic throughout the tan-colored sands, the two dunes to the
east are simple, even mounds of sand that look like vast termite mounds. 
Between the two mounds, there is an expanse of flat desert sand whose
surface ripples like the ocean waters.

Desert Path~
The murmurs of a dry, arid breeze drifts in from both the west and the
south along the desert path.  From your vantage upon the desert trail,
you see little but dunes and sand.  As you get closer to the gigantic
pyramid to the southwest, the sands of the desert begin to rise up and
form crescent-shaped, barchan dunes.

Ripples in the Sand~
Edged in on the north, east, and south side by the twisting canyon, the
desert here dead-ends.  As the tan-colored sands spread out over the
terrain, though, they seem to ripple and undulate, seemingly on their own
accord.  The wind is not to blame, for there is not even a breeze. 
Rather, every now and again, you can detect the slightest of tremors
below your feet.  From somewhere to the east, seemingly beyond the canyon
wall, you can smell the vaguest hints of fresh water.

Desert Path~
East to west, through the flat and barren wasteland which is the Naraki
Desert, stretches the bordered trail.  Various types of tracks have begun
to show up on the trail, most of which look to belong to heavy beasts of
burden.  The trail seems to curve around to the far east, around the
gigantic stone pyramid which stands to the southwest.  To the north rises
a section of the twisting canyon.

Along the trail, there are several sets of tracks.  Most look to be those

To the southwest looms a pyramid crafted of stone.  In particular, the

East of an Ancient Pyramid~
Here and to the north, the undulating waves of desert sands have
flattened enough so that passage directly up to the base of the pyramid
is possible.  As you gaze up at the pyramid from directly below, its
sheer size boggles your mind.  From the pale yellow-green limestone
sheets sheathing its surface to the massive quarry stones revealed by
missing limestone along its base, the colossal structure demands full
attention.  The upper portion of the pyramid, near the tip, stands out
the most, for the limestone up there is of a slightly different color.

E
limestone~
For the most part, the entire outer surface of the pyramid is covered
with interconnected sheets of pale, yellow-green limestone.  The
limestone is smooth, having been polished by the abrasive hands of the
desert winds.  Except towards the tip of the pyramid, the limestone has
the same uniform color and texture.
~
E
base quarry stone~
The base of the pyramid tells a story other than magnificence about the
pyramid.  When the limestone has been removed to expose the orange quarry
stone beneath, the stone blocks are often heavy cracked and chipped, as
though the burden of the pyramid were too much for them to uphold any
longer.  Where the quarry stone looks to have been exposed the longest,
there is writing chiseled into the stony surface.
~
E
writing chiseled~
A few simple words are chiseled into the exposed quarry stone blocks:

 "Only when they are all aligned shall it come to pass..."
~
E
top tip~
Along the top of the pyramid, just a few meters or so for the tip of the
pyramid, the limestone sheathing is of a deeper green color rather than a
pale yellow-green.  Cut into this colored limestone are hieroglyphics.

East of an Ancient Pyramid~
Here the desert sands have given way enough so that you can stand right
up against the eastern wall of the great pyramid.  From what you can see,
the entire pyramid, with the exception of a few spots along its base, has
been sheathed in a type of pale yellow-green limestone, which has been
polished smooth by the abrasive desert storms.  Up near the tip of the
pyramid, a series of hieroglyphics, each nearly as tall as you, encircle
the top of the stone structure.  Closer towards the ground, there are
deep gouges in the stone.  The desert opens up to the east.

Desert Path~
Varying sizes of rocks stand to either side of a path which makes its way
through the tan sands of the desert.  On either side of the east-west
trail, there is nothing but flat desert.  No dunes, grasses, or other
signs of life can be seen outside the boundaries of the trail.  On the
path here, though, there are the beginnings of a set of tracks.  To the
southwest looms a colossal, pyramid-shaped construction.

The stones bordering the path which curves from the north to the east are

boundary marks for the trail, for quite some time.  Towards the eastern
part of the trail, there are a series of tracks.
~
E
tracks~
There are three sets of tracks leading down the trail towards the east. 
The first set is composed of a pair of parallel lines, probably made by a
wagon.  The other two sets of tracks are nearly identical and look to be
the hoofed foot prints of some type of beasts of burden.

Desert Path~
Just to the south, an impossibly giant structure stands in the middle of
the valley now turned desert.  The great megalith is shaped like a
pyramid and its outer surface has been sheathed in gleaming limestone. 
The edges and base of the monument, though, have been stripped of their
limestone casing and the colossal quarry blocks beneath have begun to
crumble.  To the east lies a desert trail.

Where the limestone sheathing has been removed from around the base of
the pyramid, blocks of square, pale yellow quarry stone have exposed. 
Each block is about as tall and long as a troll and must weigh as much as
a small mountain.  So far, in this twisted canyon, there are no signs of
this pale yellow stone being native to the region.
~
E
pyramid megalith~
It is pointless to try and measure how large or tall this structure
really is.  Towards the top of the pyramid, near the tip, there are
etched designs in the limestone.  You'd have to move further south to see
them.
~
E
limestone~
Polished by the natural weathering effects of the desert, the limestone
sheathing encasing most of the pyramid practically glows.  Towards the

Mounds of tan sand huddle against the side of the pyramid, obscuring most

Once part of an even greater sheet of limestone sheathing, this piece of

gouges~
Deep gouges have been cut into the side of the pyramid.  From the

Desert Path~
Outlined by irregularly placed rocks and boulders, a path leads west and
south through the desert.  Currently, no tracks but your own have
disturbed the sandy trail.  The twisting rock canyon which seems to
encompass the entire desert looms overhead to the north and to the far
east, creating steep, inwardly sloped cliffs.  To the west stretches a
featureless expanse of arid wasteland.

Canyon Shelter~
In all directions but the west, the twisting canyon walls surround you. 
But here, the harsh desert winds fail to penetrate the sloped cliff
outcroppings, creating a sanctuary from the brutal, arid climate.  A
circle of stones, the obvious remains of a campfire, lie on the ground
towards the back of the shelter.  It appears you would not be the first
to use the canyon cul-de-sac as a refuge from the unfriendly desert
terrain.

Desert Warren~
Judging from the scrapings along the floor and the piles of bone
scattered here and there, it looks as if something very large has taken
up residence in this system of underground caverns.  The roof of the
cavern here slopes gently downward, to the south, where the cavern opens
up into a simple chamber of hard-packed sand.  The brown rock walls bear
ripple marks, as though formed by some great heat.  But these are not the
only marks on the wall.  Deep, gouging claw marks also mar the surfaces
of the cavern walls.  To the west lies the mouth of a tunnel, which is
framed by a row of teeth-like dripstone formations.

The markings trailing along the floor amidst the sand appear to be

system.
~
E
piles bones~
The remains of several very humanoid bodies lie strewn about the sandy
floor.  Their remains have been picked clean of flesh and belongings and
several appear to be missing body parts as well.  All in all, for those
with a weak stomach, the sight of so many fleshless corpses lying
together en masse is, at best, a bit unnerving.  The bones of several of
the individuals are deeply pitted, as though abraded by something fierce.
~
E
gouging marks claw~
Deep, blade-thin gouges have been sliced into the rocky walls in
groupings of four.  Obviously claw marks, the gashes are each about eight
inches long.  While you do not have an exact idea about what caused them,
you get the feeling it would probably be best to avoid them.
~
E
mouth tunnel teeth-like dripstone formations~
Tiny, teeth-like stalactites no bigger than a tailor's needle surround
the upper part of a cavern mouth which extends to the west.  Formed from
deposits of red limestone, the toothy stalactites give the cavern
entrance the overall appear of walking into the orifice of some extremely
large creature, whose teeth are dripping blood.
~
E
ripple patterns~
The constant presence of dripping moisture has eroded away the walls of
the cavern in places and deposited excess minerals in others.  The
overall affect is to score the limestone walls with a series of wave-like
ripples that undulate up and down the surfaces of the pale green rock.

Small Cavern~
Though not very tall, this limestone cavern is extremely wide.  But it is
also very plain.  There are no formations of dripstone rising from the
floor or ceiling and nor are the walls rippled.  Instead, there is but a
single drapery of iridescent stone which sparkles with a hint of gold
along its edges.  The mouth of the cavern narrows into a small tunnel
which extends to the south.

Created by a steady flow of water depositing sediments to form the
delicate mineral curtain, the iridescent drapery sparkles like a faerie's
gossamer wings.  The fragile dripstone formation hangs in the center of
the chamber, like a veil.  It appears as though gold has been deposited
around the bottom fringes of the drapery.
~
E
hint gold sparkle~
Though there is but a needle's width of metallic gleam along the bottom
of the mineral drapery, your keen eyes assure you that it is indeed gold. 
While it might be hard to believe, it looks as though a vein of gold ore
is slowly being eroded and deposited along the edge of the iridescent
drapery.  Unfortunately, there is not enough gold here to bother with
taking.

Cavern Tunnel~
The walls of this tunnel have a smooth, but rippled texture, as though
some great river of fire coursed down through its limestone branches. 
The only exception to this is the limestone floor, which is scuffed and
scratched by what looks to be constant traffic.  A small cavern opens up
to the north while to the west and east, the smooth tunnel continues
onward.

With walls of brown limestone, this cavern tunnel has few features, other
than the melted look its walls has.  The cavern has three branches.  The
western branch appears to enter into a large, domed chamber.  A dim, red
glow and waves of heat can be seen coming from the mouth of the domed
cavern.  To the north looms a cavern maybe twice the size of the one to
the west.  The tunnel continues onward down the eastern branch.

Domed Cavern~
The first thing which catches your attention is this cavern is its
incredibly hot temperature and the waves of visible heat uplifting from
the back of the chamber.  Taller than any part of the cavern system you
have so far seen, the ceiling of this cavern rises up into a gentle
hemisphere dome over your head.  You can easily pick out veins of quartz
and other minerals running through the immense ceiling dome.  A dim but
eerie red glow illuminates the humid chamber and seems to emanate from a
circular depression in the limestone floor.  Malproportioned with the
chamber itself, a tunnel leads east out of the chamber.

E
depression circular~
Situated in the center of the domed cavern lies a circular depression in
the floor about fifteen feet wide.  The depression glows with a red
illumination and as you get closer, you can see why.  Gurgling up but
remaining within the basin is a small lake of molten lava!  Floating in
the lake are several round stones about two feet in diameter that swirl
with the lava's viscous current.
~
E
round stones~
The smooth, round stones floating within the basin of molten lava look as
though they would melt and be consumed by the fiery liquid.  But as the
round stones circle around, being carried on the currents of the lava,
you notice for the first time that the stones have a scaly texture to
them.  Perhaps they are not stones at all, but eggs!
~
E
eggs~
Thinking that perhaps the scaly round stones floating in the basin of
lava are eggs, you notice that indeed, one of the 'stones' is beginning
to crack open.  Perhaps it would be best to leave now.
~
E
dim red glow magma~
The dim red glow reminds you much of light cast from a source of intense
fire.  The source of the dim illumination comes from a depression in the
center of the cavern.
~
E
tunnel 1 east~
A tunnel much too small for anything larger than an ent to leave through
extends to the east, out of the domed cavern.  The sides of the tunnel
are rough and scraped.
~
E
veins quartz gold~
Thick veins of quartz and gold run through the domed ceiling of the
cavern, which arcs nearly a hundred feet over your head.  The quartz
appears to be in more abundance than the gold, but is also located in a
much more dangerous spot to mine.  While the veins of gold ore are
concentrated mainly along the sides of the dome, the quartz veins run
right through its center, directly over the lava-filled depression.  It
looks as though removal of too much of either mineral would severely
compromise the integrity of the cavern.

Hatchling Chamber~
The ceiling of this limestone chamber is low-lying.  It expands upward
towards the center of the cavern like a tent, only to descend along the
back.  Beads of moisture roll down the brown limestone walls, to collect
in small puddles along the ground.  Two conical stalagmites reach from
the ground until they meet up with two stalactites of roughly the same
size, with their tips pressed together like a pair of lovers locked in a
tender embrace.  The dripstone formations frame the threshold of the
chamber's entrance where the cavern extends to the east.  Against the
western wall, in a bowl-like depression, lie a pile of discarded bones.

stalactites ~
While the limestone in this chamber is of a pale, green hue, the
stalactites are a mixture of both green and yellow limestone varieties. 
As the stalactites taper downward to points, the green and yellow
limestones swirl together in layers.
~
E
stalagmites~
The teeth-like protrusions of limestone erupting from the floor are
formed of pale green limestone.  Narrow claw marks have been slashed into
the sides of the stalagmites, revealing yellow limestone beneath.
~
E
bones~
Much to your relief, the bones look to be those of some large pack beast
and not a humanoid.  Long, curving horns stretch out of the skeleton's
cranium and judging from what is left intact of the spinal column, the
beast had a tail.  Other than that, the bones are in complete disarray. 
And as expected, there are deep gnaw marks on most of the bones.
~
E
bowl-like depression~
Formed by the erosion of limestone, this large, oval depression sinks
about three feet into the floor of the cavern.  The smoothness of its

Below the Surface of the Oasis~
Regardless of your light source, you find it difficult to see much in the
dark blue waters of the oasis.  You can, however, see the surface of the
oasis, which beckons upward to you strangely.  The sides of the oasis
basin appear to be of some type of grainy, porous rock which has little
clusters of bright algae clinging to it.  Below, descending further down
into the depths of the water-filled shaft, there is movement.

Gazing upwards through the dark blue waters of the oasis, you can see the
surface still.  With little effort, you could easily swim your way back
up to its comforting shore.
~
E

As you stare down into the depths of the oasis, you can see very little. 
A scattering of movement here, perhaps a few plants there.  Otherwise,
the depths of the oasis are a complete mystery.
~
E
movement~
From what little you can see through the dark, blue waters, the movement
looks to be coming from a variety of tendril-like plants swaying back and
forth in the depths.
~
E
walls sides porous~
The sides of the oasis basin are rough and porous, much like pumice. 
However, the pores are much smaller, though, and appear to be holding the
waters of the oasis in their grasp with little trouble.  Growing in the
crevices and many of the basis's pores are patches of bright, colorful
algae.
~
E
bright algae colorful~
Lacking roots or leaves, clusters of fuzzy algae cling to the sides of
the oasis basin.  The algae come in all shades and colors, from a deep
red to a bright blue.  For the most part, the algae just adds color to
the otherwise dark depths of the oasis.  However, there is evidence that
at least a few of the aquatic plants have been the source of food for
some creature.  Entire chunks are missing out of some of these pieces of
algae.

Within the Oasis~
Though the waters around you are becoming increasingly dark and hard to
see through, your eyes can barely discern the surface from here.  Around
you the circular oasis basin walls press and descend still further down
into the depths of the oasis.  More brightly colored patches of algae and
small, leafy plants cling to the basin walls.  Rising from below, you can
see the tops of tendril leaves, which spiral like an alicorn, swaying
back and forth gently almost hypnotically.

E
plants leafy small~
It is unusual to find plants growing so deep below the surface, away from
the sunlight, but nevertheless, there are several clinging to the sides
of the basin.  The chief and most colorful of the small, leafy plants is
a primrose creeper.  Its tendril branches stretch out in all directions
in the water, with a covering of red-veined and oval-shaped leaves.  A
smattering of vibrant yellow flowers also bloom along the tendrils.
~
E
bright colorful algae~
Patches of algae in every color imaginable grow in sparse patches along
the sides of the oasis.  In several places, the algae are missing large
portions of themselves; as if something has taken a very large chunk out
of them.
~
E
top alicorn tendril ~
The spiraling tendrils of long, aquatic grasses sway back and forth in
the depths of the oasis.  As you get closer to them, they seem to react
to your presence and begin to sway more violently.
~
E
basin walls~
The walls of the basin are formed from a pumice-like rock with smaller
pores and a little smoother surface.  The pores seem to be only
semi-permeable, for it looks as though no waters are escaping from the
oasis.
~
E

Far above, you can make out the faintest rays of natural light.  With a
little effort, you could probably swim upwards, toward the surface.

floor is just below you.  Yet more movement and plant life can be seen

Deep Under the Oasis~
At last, it seems, you have reached the floor of the deep, oasis basin. 
The water here is clearer, allowing you to take in all the details of the
sandy-floored area.  Scattered along the oasis bottom are varies
outcroppings of rock and bits of shell which lie here and there near the
foot of several colossal spiraling plants.  The twisted tendril vines
sway from side to side and stretch upwards toward the surface of the
oasis.  Also, resting on the oasis bottom, are several larger-than-normal
fresh water oysters.

floor sandy~
The bottom of the oasis basin is covered with countless fine grains of
tan sand.  A variety of plants erupt out of the sandy earth, as do
several rock outcroppings.
~
E
rocky outcroppings~
On closer inspection, the outcroppings of rock do not appear to have
originally been part of the underwater terrain here.  Instead, judging
from the variety of stone color (some black, some red, some white)
present, it appears that the rocks have been tossed into the oasis and
have settled to the bottom.  Clinging to the outcroppings are patches of
colorful algae.
~
E

Strewn about the sandy floor of the oasis are pieces of old and broken
shells.  Many of the shells look to be but smaller fragments of giant
oyster shells.
~
E
tendril twisted spiraling leaves plants~
Gigantic aquatic plants whose roots look deeply dug into the sandy floor
spiral upwards towards the surface of the oasis.  The seemingly-animate
tendrils of the plant sway back and forth with sometimes violent
intensity.
~
E
fresh water oysters~
Beneath a couple of the rock outcroppings are beds of giant, fresh water
oysters.  Many of the oysters are larger than a dwarf and twice as wide. 
Most of the oysters are of a iridescent white color, but a few have pink
or even black shells.

Tip of an Obelisk~
Shattered sections of pale orange quarry stone and green limestone lie
all around in a debris field.  Amidst the ruins stands but a single piece
of stone in the shape of a pyramid which has survived destruction.  The
pyramid stands about ten feet tall and rests at the base of the broken
obelisk.  Indeed, the pyramid is actually what remains of the obelisk's
tip and remains fairly intact, save for a bit of charring around the
edges. Wiry, leaf-covered vines grow all over the stone remains.  To
the south a group of trees circle together, their trunks so close
together that not an inch of space stands between them.

1 south trees ~
The trees to the south seem to be encircling an area of the grove,
towards its center.  Though you cannot see in between the trees, because
they are so close together, you can heard the faint, musical trickle of
cascading water.
~
E
tip~
Amazingly, the very tip of the once mighty obelisk which once stood very
near hear, stands almost completely intact.  Small cracks and fractures
occur along the base of the pyramidal structure and the edges and very
tip of the stone construction are blackened as though from fire or
lightning.  Engraved in the pale-green limestone, hieroglyphics adorn
each of the four sides of the obelisk, starting with the northside.
~
E
northside crook~
A panel of hieroglyphics has been etched into the northside of the
obelisk's tip and you can barely make out the remains of a blue pigment
which once filled in the engravings.  Carved into the panel are images of
an owl, a twisted crook, a jackal-like creature, and several geometric
shapes.
~
E
westside feather~
The western side of the tip of the obelisk contains an intricately
bordered hieroglyphics panel.  Yet, inside the panel there is but one
symbol: a feather.
~
E
eastside arm~
Engraved into the limestone sheeting of the obelisk's tip, there is a
hieroglyphics panel which sports a series of interesting yet cryptic
symbols.  Among them, there are scarabs, crescent moons, a feather, and
an arm reaching across the feather from east to west.
~
E
shattered sections stone~
The shattered sections of stone strewn all about the clearing consists of
sheets of pale green limestone and precision-cut, square blocks of orange
quarry stone.  At one time, it is apparent that the sections of stone
rested atop one another with the pyramidal structure on top, but some
force has brought the ancient monument down into ruins.  Judging from all
the vegetation grown up around the sections of stone, from bushes to
trees, the monument has lain like this for quite some time.  Perhaps
decades or even centuries.
~
E
obelisk~
Judging from what remains of the monument, this was once a great obelisk
which towered over most everything except for the colossal pyramid which
lies somewhere to the north, in the Naraki Desert.  Its widest point was
at its base, and as it rose upwards the structure gently tapered, until
capped by the tip of stone which lies here.
~
E
southside wings~
Once the vines have been cleared from the southside of the obelisk's tip,
you can make out a panel of hieroglyphics.  This panel consists of a bird
in flight, several saucer or cup-shaped images, an open eye, and an urn.

Inside a Broken Monument~
At one time, this chamber must have served as some grandiose ritual
center.  The walls are constructed of pale orange quarry stone which has
been cut and fitted together with greater skill than even the best
dwarven craftsman could muster.  While the quarry stone walls are covered
with panel after panel of hieroglyphics, it is the floor and ceiling of
the chamber which lends to the unusual.  Along the floor there is an
inlaid, silver etching of a square design.  The ceiling bears a similar
etching, but of gold and a circle.  To the east, framed by vertical
strips of hieroglyphics, there is a passage into another part of what
remains of the obelisk.  A single ray of light streams down from the top
of the chamber, to land just outside the inlaid square.
~

E
gold circle ceiling~
A perfect circle has been etched into the ceiling and filled with gold. 
You are not certain as to what purpose the circle serves or once served,
but it clearly seems to be ceremonial or part of some ritual.  Directly
below the golden circle, etched in a similar manner on the floor of the
chamber, is a silver square.
~
E
silver square floor~
Directly below a circle of gold etched into the ceiling rests a similar
etching.  But this one is square in shape and is filled with silver, not
gold.  The square and circle look like they once served a ceremonial
purpose, but as to what, you have no idea.  There is evidence that
something large, a block of stone or an altar, perhaps, at one time
rested at the center of the square.
~
E
passage~
The passage east, which leads into another chamber, appears to have been
hastily and newly crafted.  Or at least the construction is new in
comparison with the rest of the structure.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Out of all the hieroglyphics, only the second, fifth, and ninth panels of
them have remained intact through the ages.  The rest have either been
torn apart by deep, rending cracks in the quarry stone or have faded away
into illegibility.
~
E
vertical strips~
Unlike the majority of the hieroglyphics adorning the walls, the two
vertical strips standing to either side of the eastern passage remain
completely intact.
~
E
walls~
At one time, panels of hieroglyphics decorated the walls of this chamber,
three panels each.  But deep cracks have destroyed many of them, scoring
their surfaces completely with small fissures.  Also, along the walls are
various hieroglyphic symbols standing alone by themselves.  They include
a skull, a coin, an eye, and a holy symbol of sorts and a mask.
~
E
eye open oval~
Engraved into one of the walls is a hieroglyphic of an eye.  The eye is
wide open and blue and brimming with wisdom.
~
E
skull~
On the lower right hand corner of the southmost wall there is a
hieroglyphic of a skull.  Though just a drawing, it conveys a deep sense
of death.
~
E
gold coin~
Depicted with a yellowish-gold paint, a drawing of a golden coin adorns
one of the walls.  On its obverse side, the only one visible, there is a
picture of a roaring dragon curled about a tremendous hoard of treasure.
~
E
holy symbol~
One of the hieroglyphics on the wall is that of a lone symbol.  Shaped
like a cross with a looped top, the symbol is rendered in a silvery paint.
~
E
mask beautiful~
One of the lone hieroglyphics remaining intact on the cracked walls is
that of a mask.  The features on the mask are quite beautiful by any
standard.  So beautiful are they that it seems almost like an expression
of vanity.

Inside a Monument~
The walls of this rectangular chamber are framed by gigantic blocks of
orange quarry stone.  Down and through many of the stones, though, run
deep cracks, as though great stress has been placed upon the cool, stone
walls.  Hieroglyphics adorn nearly every square inch of the walls and
ceiling, painted in neat rows using a variety of pigments.  Two passages
lead out of the chamber, one to the west and one to the south.  Both
thresholds appear to be hastily crafted and lack the same precision and
attention to exactness that is shared throughout the construction of the
rest of the chamber.

The edges of the passageway to the south are cracked and rough, like it

Deep cracks run diagonally across the surface of the quarry stone walls,

Lopsided Chamber~
It appears as if some great earthquake has assaulted this rectangular
chamber, whose height decreases slightly from west to east.  The room is
drastically slanted, with its southwest corner dipping down.  Thus, it is
also very difficult to maintain your balance in here.  Although the pale,
orange quarry stone walls are covered with rows of hieroglyphics, many of
the enigmatic depictions have been rendered unreadable by wide cracks
that run down and over them like a series rampaging river tributaries. 
The floor and ceiling are made of hard-packed sand, which shows no signs
of giving way.  Rough and seemingly makeshift passages branch off from
the room, to other oddly-constructed chambers to the north, west, and
east.

walls quarry stone~
The interior walls of this chamber are build from chiseled blocks of
pale, orange quarry stone.  The sides have been hand smoothed and set
into place with an eye to precision rivaled by none.  Each block of stone
is about five feet long and three feet high and must weigh in excess of
five thousand pounds.
~
E
ceiling floor hard-pack sand ~
The ceiling and floor of this chamber are made of hard-packed tan sand,
and not quarry stone.  Judging from the cracks running along the
stonework of them both, it seems apparent that at one time, this chamber
had a stone ceiling and floor in place of the sand.  Someone has gone to
a lot of trouble to reconstruct this chamber after whatever natural
disaster is suffered.
~
E
corner~
A lot of sand and flecks of stone have collected in a pile in the corner,
where it dips downward sharply.  Most of the pieces of stone lodged in
the corner appear to be from the walls, where fissures have destroyed the
wall surfaces.
~
E
hieroglyphics enigmatic depictions~
From birds, to lizards, serpents to scarabs, all manner of creatures and
designs decorate the remaining two hieroglyphic panels which adorn the
walls of the chamber.  All the other stone chiseled panels have been
destroyed as cracks and fissures have descended down through their
surfaces.  This leaves only the fourth and seventh panel of hieroglyphics
at all legible.

Broken Chamber~
It looks as though this rectangular chamber, which narrows slightly from
west to east, at one time was part of the obelisk's mid-section.  The
west wall is nothing but a sheer barrier of broken orange quarry stone
while the edges of the east wall are jagged and sharp, as though it has
been snapped apart from another part of the obelisk.  The ceiling, walls,
and floor give credence to this notion for they are covered with neat
little rows of carefully penned hieroglyphics.  This in itself is not
unusual.  But the fact that the rows run horizontal and not vertical
indicates that they, and the entire chamber, are lying on their side.

Judging from the amount of debris clogging the west passage, a
significant portion of the broken obelisk must lie in that direction. 
There are no gaps in the debris and no hope of getting past it.
~
E
1 east~
The edges of the eastern passageway are rough and jagged.  It seems as
though a section of the obelisk which once connected to this chamber was
suddenly and brutally ripped away, leaving but sections of quarry stone
intact.  Hastily done patchwork has been utilized to patch the stone into
a new chamber.
~
E
ceiling floor panels hieroglyphics ~
The ceiling, floor, and the north and south walls of this chamber are
covered with horizontal panels of hieroglyphs.  For the most part, the
hieroglyphics are a crumbled mess, with cracks running down the middle of
most of them.  However, a few hieroglyphic panels, the first and sixth
one, are entirely whole.

Lopsided Chamber~
Like the chamber to the west, this one has a ceiling and floor formed
from hard-packed sand. It also looks like part of the chamber, the northwest part, is
sinking like a rock cast into quicksand.  The rectangular chamber tapers
slightly from west to east, being the narrowest down towards the east
side.  Though hieroglyphics grace most of the surface walls, the ones
along the east, are special.  Rather than being applied to the pale,
orange quarry stone walls with pigments, these have been sculpted into
the walls.  And unlike any other wall in this chamber, it is hewn, not
from coarse quarry rock, but from a single piece of rose quartz, which
has been polished until it gleams.

1 east rose quartz~
To the east stands a wall made of pure rose quartz, a very rare shade of
mineral.  Etched into the surface of the mineral are panels of
hieroglyphics which have remained completely intact through the ages and
through an apparent earthquake, if the cracks and fissures riddling the
walls are any indication.
~
E
hieroglyphics~
Twelve panels of hieroglyphics adorn the walls of this chamber.  For the
most part, deep fissures and stone fractures have streamed down through
the quarry stone, ripping the hieroglyphics away from the walls, along
with the stone.  Only two panels of hieroglyphics remain even partly
intact: the eleventh and eighth ones.  Both are etched into a wall of
pure rose quartz.

E
ceiling floor~
The ceiling and floor of this chamber are constructed from hard-packed
sand.  Incidentally, it is obvious that this was not the original layout

floor have been makeshifted together, just to make this chamber habitable.

Underground Lair~
A vast underground cavern with polished walls of limestone surrounds you. 
At one time, there must have been stalactites projecting from the
ceiling, but they have been sheared off by some force.  The floor of the
cavern is covered with a loose sifting of sand. Every now and again, a
trickle of sand falls from cracks in the ceiling.  Extending to the
south, the cavern opens up into an extremely tall but narrow cavern.

walls limestone polished~
The limestone walls here have been carefully polished until they almost
gleam they are so smooth.  In rare circumstances, erosion by wind and
sand can duplicate the polishing affects seen here.  But there is neither
enough sand nor even a breeze flowing through this chamber.  Thus,
someone has went to great length to smooth out this cavern.
~
E
ceiling stalactites~
At one time, five stalactites, each about four feet in diameter,
projected down from the ceiling though the cavern.  One by one, they have
been removed and their bases ground down, until very little remains of
their presence.
~
E
cracks~
Most of the cracks are little more than two or three inch fissures that
cascade through the ceiling rock like miniature rivers and waterfalls. 
However, there is one crack in the ceiling that looks quite large. 
Currently, a packing of hard sand is blocking the passage through the
wider fissure.
~
E
sifting sand~
Particles of sand sift through the cracks in the ceiling of the chamber,
drifting down until they come to rest on the floor of the cavern.  Most
of the sand is tan in color.  All manner of tracks and foot prints have
been made along the sandy bottom of the cavern, all of which look as far

along the walls and floor, there is nothing remarkable about the lofty
cavern, except a tunnel opening into a southern chamber.  A foul smell
emanates from that direction.

gouge gouging claw marks~
If you didn't know better, you would think some cat had been using the
walls as a scratching post.  Deep gouges have been cut into the stone,
some of which are a foot long and several inches in depth.  Of course,
for scratches of this magnitude, the cat would need be about three times

Polished until they are smoother than a swindler's tongue, the walls of

Extremely Tall Cavern~
A grandiose chamber of limestone runs east to west beneath the sands of
the Naraki Desert.  Like a hallway in a fairy tale castle, the ceiling is
vaulted and sparkles due to its well-polished surface.  The ground, which
is also composed of pale green limestone, bears a similar smooth finish. 
An acrid, sulfurous odor issues forth from a southern side passage.

Cut and polished beams of limestone arc upwards, supporting the vaulted
ceiling which rises high above.  A giant could walk through these
corridors without a thought to height restrictions.  The ceiling itself
has also been hand buffed.  Not a single inch of roughness remains along
the pale green stone's surface.  All that the ceiling lacks is a crystal
chandelier to be worthy of a king's palace.
~
E

Like the vaulted ceiling above, the ground and walls of the chamber, both
of which are composed of pale green limestone, have been polished to
perfection.  One interesting thing about both, though, are that there are
no cracks or fissures in either.  It is as though these caverns have been
worked over by a great artisan or a skilled stone mason.  At the base of
the northern wall, where floor meets wall, there is an etched message.

Foul Smelling Den~
The first thing you notice as you step into this average-sized cavern is
the horrendous stench of not only of death but of rotting meat.  And sure
enough, discarded here and there, in several piles, are half-eaten and
some totally untouched carcasses.  In the southwest corner of the lava
flow cavern, there are veins of obsidian running down through the walls. 
Two tunnels formed by the passage of molten rock branch off from the
sides of the cavern.  One tunnel leads northward and the other leads
eastward.  Both are roughly the same size and are perfectly circular in
shape.  The tunnel to the east, though, has deeper interior ridges.

obsidian~
Veins of obsidian, a rare, volcanic glass, run through the walls of this
chamber, in a most unusual fashion.  Most of the obsidian is black in
color, which is the most common shade of the mineral.  But a few of the
smaller veins are of green obsidian, which is thought to be much harder
than the rest.  With the right equipment, you could probably extract a
piece of the volcanic rock.
~
E
carcasses half-eaten ~
Without pattern or reason, half-eaten corpses of every size and shape lie
scattered about the room.  A few lizards here.  A couple of humans there. 
Even a gnome are among the ranks of the mauled and mostly devoured
corpses.  Only one carcass lies completely untouched.  It is a bloated
corpse of a brown hatchling dragon.
~
E
rusty iron chain remains~
Bolted to the floor lie the twisted remains of a length of iron 
chain. The iron is thoroughly rusted, a mark of its age, and 
stretched. Apparently, the chain had been used to imprison the 
hatchling brown dragon. Before dying, it seems the dragon won its freedom. 
~
E
bloated corpse brown hatchling dragon~
The brown hatchling dragon has been dead just long enough for its
interior to decompose and create a build up of gases within the creature,
bloating it.  Its eyes are a milky-grey color and its scaly, particularly
those around its neck, are shredded thin.  Seemingly, this baby dragon
was captured or lured here and subsequently died.  It looks as though no
attempt has been made to eat the bloated carcass.  Which is just as well. 
One swift kick would probably explode the little thing into a gory mess
anyway.  Next to the bloated corpse, there are the rusty remains of an
iron chain.

Hot Springs~
The smell of sulfur rises up to assail your nostrils as you enter this
large, rectangular cavern.  Unlike the rest of this underground series of
small caverns linked together by connecting tunnels, this cavern is of
natural limestone and has not witnessed the passage of lava descending
through and over its surfaces.  Along the back of the cavern, steam rises
up off a spring of water, which is obviously fed from a deep, more
underground source and somehow brought to a boil through some hidden,
geothermal event.  The gurgling waters of the spring reek of sulfur. 
From this cavern, there lies a den of sorts to the west and the
beginnings of an extremely lofty chamber to the north.

Extremely Large Cavern~
Five tree-sized stalactites project down from the ceiling of the cavern. 
Five equally as large stalagmites rise up from the floor to meet the
limestone formations, point to point.  In the middle of the limestone
cavern, at the center of the pentagon formed by the stalactites and
stalagmites, there is a natural, bowl-like depression.  Piles of dried,
desert grass have been placed in the depression, to create a nest of
sorts.  The cavern extends to the north.

Bone Littered Cavern~
Never before have you seen such a gross display of discarded life.  Not
even in a cemetery or mausoleum could there be more bones.  Stacked and
piled and accumulated and heaped all over the lava-shaped cavern, in
short, tall, crooked and swaying masses are hundreds of thousands of
bones.  It is difficult to pick out their origins, there are so many. 
The most unusual thing about this chamber of bone is that you see no
skulls whatsoever in the chamber.  Two lava flow tubes lead out of the
chamber: one to the east and one to the south.

Stacked as carefully and in the fashion of building a log cabin, there

more than one species.
~
E
piles~
Some cracked, some broken, some melted?, countless vertebrae lies in neat
yet chaotically strewn piles throughout the cavern chamber.  Most of the
vertebrae are about the size of human vertebrae but some are big enough
to have come from a dragon.
~
E
heaps~
In several heaps along the floor of the cavern, there are masses of hand
and feet bones.  Most of which are not in the least fully intact.  Both
the flesh and in some cases the marrow has been stripped off or out of
the slender bones.
~
E
accumulations~
Gathered in large accumulations about the chambers are masses of rib
cages.  Each rib cage has either been cracked or bashed in, scorched or

Twisting Canyon Littered with Sand~
The walls of this sandstone canyon loom more than a hundred feet above
your head, belittling your presence.  Undulating like an ocean's wave,
the canyon curves and shifts so that it is possible to see where it opens
onto a rough, uneven road to the northeast, its main course lies along a
twisting path to the west and east.  The road in unreachable from here,
because of the way the canyon curves.  Piles of light brown, almost
tan-colored sand litters the floor of the twisting canyon.  The sand
serves as a preamble for what lies westward it seems, for in that
direction, sand appears to cover the entire canyon bottom.
~
[Lantol] i think "The road in unreachable from here," should be 'is', not 'in'.

To the north and south loom two walls of sandstone which twist about on

Lair of the Yellow Dragon~
Unlike the other parts of the cavern, this room is rectangular in shape. 
The walls meet the ceiling and floor in crisp, right angles and are
constructed from polished grey marble and not limestone.  Inset into the
walls are triangular niches, filled top to bottom with skulls of every
shape, size, and origin.  Towards the back of the chamber, against the
western wall, is a throne fashioned completely of bone.  A tunnel leads
out of the east into another cavern chamber.
~
[Taryn] I can look at the throne here, but I can't sit on it or any such thing.
[Ssleestaq] why does the burst of flame from throne do physical damage.

triangular niches~
Carved into the marble walls of this cavern are four feet tall triangular
niches.  As the niches circle the walls, they alternate their
orientations between their top point being down or up.  Skulls, stacked
together without thought to species, fill each niche from bottom to top. 
At once, you are reminded of a great trophy room, where hunter might
display his or her greatest kills.
~
E
skulls~
Inside each triangular niche are a variety of skulls.  Among all of them,
you can recognize numerous human, gnomen, elven, serpentmen, dwarven, and
halfling skulls.  To a lesser degree, you spot much larger skulls of a
more reptilian nature filling the inset alcoves.
~
E
bone throne~
The focus of the chamber appears to be this throne.  Fashioned from
femurs, tibias, and the skulls of many creatures, most of which you
cannot place or name, the throne stands out as a macabre display towards
the irreverence of life.  The back of the throne curves outward and up
and is capped with the horned skull of a dragon.  Each of the throne's
arms has an actual arm in its construction, with a clawed hand to the
left and a human hand to the right.  Only the seat of the throne differs
in composition.  Brown hide with a scaly texture has been strung taut
across it.
~
E
walls marble~
Hewn from giant slabs of grey marble, the walls themselves present quite
a mystery.  Not only are they not what you would expect at the heart of a
series of cavern, but they also look well polished and smoothed, as
though great care has been taken to construct this chamber.  Carved into
the walls are triangular niches.

Beneath a Spot in the Castle's Wall~
Below the wall of one of the sand castles is a small limestone cavern
which stretches back to the south.  While the hole in the cavern ceiling
looks fresh and recent, there is no doubt that this cavern is very old. 
The floor, which can be seen beneath patches of covering sand, has been
scraped smoothed from constant passage and the upper walls, near the
opening, have eroded to fine, rounded edges.  Up above, you can see some
of the foundation stones protruding down through the cavern's ceiling.

Beneath patches of loose sand, you catch details of the smooth, limestone

Scorpions' Lair~
Little more than twenty feet wide and deep, the small, green limestone
cavern is plain and drab.  No exotic formations of rock creep up from the
ground nor descend from the ceiling.  The walls are coarse and the floor
is covered with a thin layer of sand which has no doubt drifted in from
the desert above.  The discarded remnants of many a meal lie around this
cavernous chamber, tossed into the corners of the room.  Near one such
macabre display stands a pool of crystal-clear water.  Reeds of some
green plant grow around the back edge of the water, opposite the cavern's
only entrance.

Twisting Canyon~
The walls of this canyon are made of sandstone and look increasingly
unstable the higher they rise.  A few rocks balance precariously atop its
edges and look as though they might fall at any second.  Overall, the
canyon walls loom more than a hundred feet above your head.  The
beginning of a rough, uneven road bordered by greenery lies to the north
while to the west the rock canyon continues like a corridor through a
mausoleum.  Very little vegetation grows in the hard ground.

Gigantic Chamber~
The shaly, sedimentary rock walls of this massive cavern bulge in several
places, where the moisture rolling down off the ceiling has caused the
stone to literally dissolve and reform.  Also, stone waves run through
nearly every surface imaginable.  From ceiling to floor, tiny undulations
course through the limestone cavern, like gentle ripples in a pond.  From
the ceiling hangs an assortment of needle-thin stalactites, whose grip
seems so precarious that the slightest noise might send them crashing
down upon your head.  To the west, you can see a pair of stalactites and
stalagmites framing the entrance to a side cavern and to the south, the
cavern narrows to but a single tunnel.

The two pairs of dripstone columns which frame the cavern mouth to the

above, though, are cause for more concern.  Not only are they as thin as
needles, but many of them look extremely loose.  One false move could
