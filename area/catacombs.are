A mysterious tunnel~
Runes glow a dull blue on the walls, but they don't appear to be a
warding or instructions.  Instead, they appear to be a natural part to
this rather unnatural place.  Electricity buzzes through the air,
creating a dull hum that shakes your bones.  Perhaps whoever built these
tunnels did not intend for mortals to walk down them.  Perhaps they did
not notice the rampant forces of magic crackling down the tunnel.
~
[Merior] extras? how can runes be natural?
means they appear in place, not out of place, here
[Bandolin] should the runes have an extra descript?  (I know you don't
like them, but I couldn't find anything else wrong to complain about.

A mysterious tunnel~
Gigantic doors of mirror-like black obsidian rise mightily to the east
and west, impossible to open.  A small alcove brimming with electricity
is set in the stone to the north, and to the south, a dark tunnel
stretches away.
~
[Bandolin] personally, the doors seem to need an extra desc.  (IMHO)
[Bandolin] The room says they are black doors, but the aedit 1 says it is
an obsidian gate.

A small alcove~
Runes cover the north wall, flowing in and out of a set of handprints
inset in the stone.  The hum of electricity flows over the wall like a
waterfall, an impenetrable protective field.  A small black lever is set
like a switch in the west wall, and to the south a dark tunnel disappears
into inky black.
~
[Merior] need extras
[Merior] electric field on north wall?
[Bandolin] should "hands" be a command?  because with it, "hands hands"
works 
[Bandolin] i'm new, so forgive me if i'm wrong, but result "rzap" looks
like it has an extra blank line at the end of it.

A tunnel of shifting sand~
The hard obsidian rock has begun to give way to the soft gritty texture
of desert sand.  Your footing is soft, but not unsure, as if somewhere
beneath the sands firm ground anchors all safely in place.  The tunnel
leads east, and a massive door of mirror-like obsidian rises to the west. 
A small grey lever is inset in the wall to the west.

You could probably take the one out after soft on line 2.

A tunnel of red heat~
You are standing in a tunnel of red, hot rock.  Waves of heat from an
unknown source to the west wash over you in full force.  To the east is a
large slab of mirror-like obsidian which acts as a gate to block any
passage.  A second look to the west makes the walls themselves to appear
like they are no longer made of rock, but of pure fire.  A small gray
lever is inset in the east wall.
~
don't forget rextras all through here and change rflags and rstats
[Bandolin] not sure, but the "themselves to" on line 4, doesn't need the
"to" and i think it should be "themself".

A room of shifting sand~
This small chamber swirls and changes before your eyes as mounds of sand
move all about, seemingly alive.  The sand is endless, reaching into the
heart of the earth with its depth, threatening to swallow you whole. 
Tunnels escape the chamber to the north and west.
~
[Bandolin] nothing wrong here.  the room might could use a random for
sand getting in their clothes or something.

A tunnel of shifting sand~
The walls and floor of this tunnel shift and move, making your footing
perilous as the ground moves as if to devour you.  The morphing movements
of the rock seem to increase to the south, while to the north the rock
seems more stable.
~
[Bandolin] any chance of a random action to make them trip on the hungry
sand?

rock, but the title of the room is "shifting sand"

A tunnel of shifting sand~
The walls of this tunnel waver slightly, but appear to be stable enough. 
The circumstances are different to the south, where the violent motions
of the rock threaten to swallow any adventurer that enters that tunnel. 
To the west, a tunnel of solid obsidian leads away from the mysterious
sands to unknown darkness.
~
[Merior] south is rock or sand moving?
[Bandolin] the impression i get here also is a) from the title, a room of
sand that moves, and b) from the desc, walls that are malleable

A mysterious tunnel~
While the tunnel running east and west is a mighty one indeed, the
rune-streaked obsidian passage to the north is obviously the main one. 
The tunnels show no physical signs of passage; the rock beneath your feet
shows no wear, nothing litters the ground in any direction.  It is as if
the inhabitants of this tunnel do not require the base physical mode of
transportation to which you may be accustomed.

A mysterious tunnel~
The alien runes on the east and west walls of this massive tunnel of
obsidian connect overhead, forming a weblike covering of the stone.  It

were not enough, that a magical barrier was necessary to protect their
creation.  The rune-covered hall continues to the north and south.

The walls of this tunnel appear to be made of rushing water.  The blues
and whites rush by your head and arms, rolling around in all directions. 
At your feet the water seems to have frozen into ice, making footing
slippery but stable.  A small gray lever is inset in the west wall.

check in other rooms that are similar, but shouldn't "raises" be "rises"
your call! :)
also, not sure about your rnames, is there a standard for capitalization?
^^ No there isn't a standard.  The rnames are usually a hallmark of the
builder, as long as they don't get out of hand. - Amon
[Bandolin] line three: "At your feet" needs a comma after the feet.
[Bandolin] even though the obsidian gate has an action, it isn't
mentioned in the main room desc.  (the gate isn't mentioned)

A tunnel of swirling wind~
You feel no solidity beneath your feet, no comfortable rock upon which to
rest your weight.  You stand on a firmament of swirling winds, of ocean
breeze and desert gale.  To the west, the winds seem to gather into a
ferocious storm.  A small gray lever is set into the eastern wall of
obsidian rock.
~
Nice desc.
[Bandolin] only thing i see that might be wrong is that you don't mention

The room about you swirls in a frenzy of wind, whipping you about like a

of sand into your eyes as well.  Tunnels of swirling air lead north and

The world about you spins and whirls as winds as strong as the Great
Winds that shaped the world, hold you easily aloft amidst a sea of clouds

A tunnel of swirling wind~
Misty winds blow easily by, caressing your cheek with the cool touch of
an ocean breeze.  Desert winds form a path upon which to walk, whether it
leads to the firm rock to the east or into a tunnel filled with swirling
winds to the south.
~
[Merior] winds form a path?
[Bandolin] the raw impression i get is that there are several types of
winds here, one of which holds you up in this spot.  But the seperation
between the misty wind and desert wind is vague.

A mysterious tunnel~
Cold, hard, lifeless obsidian surrounds you with its impenetrable
embrace, as black as the shadow itself making you unsure where the rock
ends.  The shadows begin to form a tunnel leading to the east.  A path
that seems to lead onto air itself stretches to the west.
~
The shadow thing confuses me a bit - amon
[Bandolin] Is there a light source that is allowing the shadows here? 
And are the shadows the actual walls to the east?

A mysterious tunnel~
A tunnel leading to the north intersects the east-west tunnel of obsidian. 
While the tunnels to the east and west seem somewhat unremarkable, to the
north the black walls are streaked with ancient runes, perhaps of warding.
~
why do you say "perhaps of warding" here when you said at the 1st room,
that the runes and such weren't wardings or instructions
^^ I would leave it, but she has a point, in that first room, the purpose
of the runes is confusing sorta.
  
also, add another sentence or two, possibly state what they see to the
east and west 
^^ don't agree. 3 is fine in an unimportant filler room.
[merior] why do you think they are warding?
[Bandolin] i'd recommend an extra desc for the runes

A mysterious tunnel~
A tunnel of black obsidian gapes open to the west, its features
undiscernable.  To the east, powerful currents overtake the rock, forming
a world of their own amidst ice and thrashing waves.

black obsidian.

Before the Wizard-Gate~
The mysterious tunnels have come to a massive gate of inscribed obsidian
located directly in front of you.  Strange sounds, similar to chanting
can be heard faintly from beyond, but it seems the sounds are conducting
through the tunnel walls rather than passing the mass of the gate.  A
dark tunnel leads back away south.
~
MOST RECENT NOTE :: gate is CLOSED. No area beyond as yet.
 
give gate more mpcode, check standard
another rbug in room north of here
...'gate' also needs to be in keywords for the door.

There were a lot of rbugs here, so i just did a lot of it.  So if i
errored, come to me.  - Amon 
BTW, I think a lot of these mobs are pretty wimpy.  And when you do
marmor, put those numbers up on a par with the players that will be
comming through here.  Ppl comming here will have mith, if not adamtite. 
I changed the door's marmor a little.
[merior] do you have to enter via the tunnel to the south?
[merior] sounds are conducting? conducted?
[merior] obviously didnt go north... let me know when/if i need to
