Before the Gates of Narak~
You are before a large gate of solid sandstone inset into a massive wall
of granite.  The top of the wall is lined with small slots for bowmen to
shoot out from, but the guards, if any are present, are not visible.  An
opposing force would face many losses if they assaulted this massive gate
of stone.  To the west an arch of gold frames a doorway to the desert
over a road of hard rock.

West Gate of Narak~
You are standing just inside the main gate of the city, a huge sandstone
slab which stretches many feet overhead.  Small portcullises mark
entrances into the walls themselves to the north and south.  What appears
to be the main street of Narak leads east, the Way of Kol Amroth, and to
the west a rock road leads away from the city.  A large @elever@n on the
side of the gate appears to be the mechanism for raising and lowering its
massive weight.

The walls of Narak~
These walls, abandoned by the cityguard, have fallen into neglect. 
Cobwebs litter every corner and cranny, and the scent of death permeates
the air.  It is definitely more chill here between the stone walls than
the desert air outside.  There is a small @blever@n on the south wall
near a portcullis.
~
[Finius] spelled definitely, no 'a'.

The Walls of Narak~
No living thing inhabits these walls, of that there is not much
uncertainty.  The sounds of rats normally thought present in the cool,
damp places uninhabited by humans are absent.  The dust on the walls
appears thick and undisturbed.  The guards gave up on occupying the walls
several years ago.
~
[Merior] first sentence odd
[Phule] i like it :)
[Finius] second sentence is very convoluted.

The stillness of the air seems suffocating, as if nothing substantial
draws breath within these walls.  The empty torch sconces in the walls
suggest that these walls were once watched by the cityguards, but have
now been abandoned.  Cobwebs hang thick from the corners where the damp
grey stones meet.  The hallway between the walls heads north and south.

You are standing below a winding stone staircase leading up into the
northwest guard tower of Narak.  Whether it was the lack of any nearby
enemies or the palpable creeping hand of death in the air that drove the
guards from the walls, the fact remains that the bravest of the cityguard
dare not step foot within these lifeless walls.

This east-west passage is located between the two outer walls of the

are gone, now, with the dust growing thick and the cobwebs thicker.  The
air here is still, damp, and chill, in stark contrast with the desert
outside.

The walls of Narak~
You are standing below a winding stone staircase leading up into the
southwest guard tower of Narak.  Whether it was the lack of any nearby
enemies or the palpable creeping hand of death in the air that drove the
guards from the walls, the fact remains that the bravest of the cityguard
dare not step foot within these lifeless walls.

The walls of Narak~
This east-west passage is located between the two outer walls of the

are gone, now, with the dust growing thick and the cobwebs thicker.  The
air here is still, damp, and chill, in stark contrast with the desert

Before a Dark, Mysterious Pool~
You stand before the smooth, mirrorlike surface of a dark pool.  Its
depths hidden, the glow of white light shimmers deep beneath its surface
like a false moon.  About 100 meters in circumference, anything from a
black dragon to a sunken ship could be below the surface.  Or nothing at
all.  A passage leads west away from the pool.

The walls of Narak~
The stillness of the air seems suffocating, as if nothing substantial
draws breath within these walls.  The empty torch sconces in the walls
suggest that these walls were once watched by the cityguards, but have
now been abandoned.  Cobwebs hang thick from the corners where the damp
grey stones meet.  The hallway between the walls heads north and south.

Above an open doorway to the north hangs a silver-engraved sign depicting

smithy, accessable via sturdy wooden steps leading up and over the
smithy's door.  To the west, Main Street reaches a bustling intersection,
while to the east, the bright signs of more shops can be seen.  To the

Way of Kel Amroth~
One of the oldest and most revered buildings in Narak, the Wyvern Inn,
stands mightily to the north.  Far from disrepair, the building is in the
same condition of perfect craftsmanship as it has always been.  To the
west, Main Street passes an arch leading to the city square, and to the
east more colourfully-pennanted shops can be seen.  A painted wooden sign
hangs above the inn's open front door to the north, beside the boughs of
an exremely out-of-place oak tree.

Way of Kel Amroth~
Two high-class shops line Main Street, a silk and fineries shop to the
north, and a dining hall to the south.  To the east you see an
intersection, across which rises the imposing structure of the sultan's
palace.  To the west you see a tree growing from the sandstone of the
street in front of a mighty inn.

Outside the Sultan's Palace~
To the east rises a marvelously constructed palace of domes and towers,
the home of the Sultan of Narak.  North and south runs Palace Street, and
to the west the shops of Main Street can be seen, with scores of merchants
going from store to store to trade, or to gather the local gossip. 
A large brass gong adorns the palace wall to the east next to an
ornately-crafted gate.  It appears you will have to knock or ring the
gong to gain entrance.
~

The Palace of the Sultan~
The sand-colored streets of Narak give way to the white marble of the
interior of the sultan's palace.  A spiraling stair leads upward to the
throne room, and to the north you see an open oakenwood door leading
toward the sultan's private chambers.  The palace gates to the west are
much too massive to be pushed open, but a large crank mounted in the wall
beside it might have something to do with its operation.  A strange
statue of a quite rotund gnome stands in the southwest corner next to a
potted plant.
~

[Merior] i presume no one can get into bedroom since it isnt done...
[Phule] bedroom is just a teaser - never meant to be done.
[Finius] good guard description.
[Finius] why do you just get to go in and see the sultan?
[Finius] not sure what code is available to make you wait, or have guards check you over first...but they should.

This statue depicts the commercial genius of the first Sultan of Narak,
the half-goblin affectionately known only as "The Sultan." His vision
rebuilt Narak and transformed it from a dying desert village to a
bustling center of trade.  The nose seems slightly off-center.

potted plant~
In a simple clay pot, this fern is very leafy and moist and is obviously
alien to the desert climes of Narak.  It is almost constantly watered by
a pair of servants who run to and from a small closet carrying buckets,
sweat drenching down their exhausted faces.

Several patrons sit in relative comfort, dining on various dishes

the bustle of the city, as no shops line the city streets.

Despite the looming form of the sultan's palace to the northeast, the

stone support a massive marble roof which encloses a graceful temple.  To
the west, the sandstone wall of a building rises up into the desert air, a
staircase leading up its edge toward a small shop above.  The merchants
and servants running to and fro along the street move more slowly and
quietly here, as if respecting the peace of the temple.

Intersection of Palace and Khotrad~
The streets of Palace and Khotrad come to a bustling intersection here,
with merchants coming and going along Palace Street to the north and
Khotrad to the west.  To the east stands a small brightly-coloured tent
with a sign above its flap, a strange spicy odor coming from the tent's
interior.  A small table and a few chairs have been placed here by the
cityguard to act as a quiet place to talk, as this corner of the city,
while busy, does not boast the commercial traffic of other parts of the
city.  A small wooden ladder runs up the wall to the south to a trapdoor. 
The trapdoor leads into a house which hangs from the wall.
~
[Merior] is cityguard one or two words?
[Phule] cityguard can be either - a like one word better.
[Finius] every guard also looks the same, dude.

The tent is poorly lit, as only a few candles on a small wooden table in
the center of the tent provide light.  Small particles fill the air,
possibly dust, and numerous jars line a few shelves filled with contents
not discernable.  Thin leather loops hang on a few racks, obviously
intended to be made into some sort of necklace.

large stone ramp leads down to the south, towards the smell of the sea. 
Large carts pulled by horses haul loads to and from the ramp below. 
Merchants crowd the large ramp which seems suddenly small, all trying to
reach or disembark from a ship at the docks.  To the west an entrance to
the city plaza can be seen over the crowd, the sounds of the plaza
carrying over the crazy din.

~
[Merior] although i have figured out the hanging houses, if this is the
first one seen, can still be confusing...
[Merior] how about something like A small stone house appears to hang
from the southern wall, and a trapdoor provides a means of accessing the
house (or something kinda like that?
[Rhen] listen sounds
[Phule] you hear the sounds of a bar?

The Camel's Tongue~
A large white mat rests in the center of this room, with several figures
practicing physical techniques on it.  Practice weapons line the walls
and occasionally one is used in instruction on the mat, but it is clear
that the weapons are not for sale.  Through the door to the east is the
intersection between Khotrad and Aghrin.

Aghrin Street runs north and south, traversing the western side of the

open doorway to the west.

Aghrin Street~
The fine sandstone of Aghrin Street stretches north toward more shops,
and south it crosses Narak's Main Street.  Above the open door to the
east hangs a silver-engraved sign depicting a curved sword crossed with
an axe, while to the west a finely-tooled wooden sign depicting a
crescent moon encircled by a coiling dragon overhangs another open
doorway.  Bright-robed merchants cavort up and down this street, yet none
seem to be looking your way.  A sturdy wooden stair leads up and over the
smithy's doorway to a balcony overhead.

The dragon coiled around the crescent moon seems almost alive, the wooden

Smiling citizens come strolling out of the doorway to the west after a
session in Brahle's Masseuse.  The heavy, blisteringly hot sandstone of
Aghrin Street leads north and south toward more shops.  A set of sturdy
wooden stairs lead up the walls on each side of the street.  The stairway
to the east climbs above an open doorway, and the stairway to the west
climbs to a shop above the street level.  The shops in this area do not
hang bright signs, but seem to be well-visited despite the lack of show.

You are standing in the northwest corner of the city, just south of the

through an open door to the west, and the streets of Aghrin and Truskin
lead south and east.  A small wooden ladder runs up the wall to the north
to a trapdoor below a house which hangs from the wall.

Leather armors hang from every inch of wall space, and yet unfinished
pieces litter a small workspace in the northeast corner promising yet

Noisy merchants walk hurridly past you from a bank to the east, and to

The intersection to the north seems dark, an area which most of the

one descending do its unknown depths and the other ascending to its
winding heights.  A small handprint-shaped pressure plate on the wall
looks to the the mechanism by which the door is opened.

Wyvern Inn~
This comfortable-looking bedroom sees frequent use by merchants
travelling to Narak.  The finest in the inn, the room boasts twin
chandeliers, a massive duckfeather bed, satin sheets, and the only cool
breeze in town, which wafts in through an open window.

The chandeliers, one at each end of the room, give off hundreds of tiny

which has somehow gone awry as the resulting effect is to simply make the

Gavlin's Magic Shoppe~
Potions, scrolls, and bits of spell components line the walls of this
small shop.  A loud hum is heard coming from behind one of the walls,
presumably a hidden back room, and a large @b@Ghourglass@n rests on the
table, sand pouring down through it.  The passing din of a busy merchant
street comes through the open doorway to the east.  A staircase leads
down into a shop below this one.

hourglass~
The grains in this strange hourglass do not appear to be sand, but
nevertheless they seem to keep time just as well.  As you watch the last
few grains trickle into the hourglass, the glass turns itself over
magically and the grains fall back through into the now empty half.
You may want to ask the shopkeeper about it.

The Parched Sand~
Smiling people look up from their drinks for a moment as you enter, but
quickly return to their rapidly-emptying tankards.  The Parched Sand is
reknowned for its ability to refresh travelers after days of travel
through the desert.  To the east is Aghrin Street.

Temple to Meriada~
Massive columns of fine white marble sits, sweep up from the four corners
of the temple to a large vaulted ceiling almost ten meters above your
head.  Against the eastern wall, a massive pedestal of fine grey and
white marble sits, on which rests a massive hourglass.  The large
hourglass is finely carved and painted in honor of Meriada.  To the west,
a grand grey marble stairway leads down out of the temple and back onto
the streets of Narak.

The Salty Passage~
In this large damp chamber that smells of the sea, one can buy passage to
different ports of the realms, for a price.  Workers take cargo to and
from the underground warehouse to the north, carrying it both up the ramp
into the city and down the tunnel to the west.  Another large tunnel
enters the city from the east, tunnelling beneath the city walls and out
into the deserts east of the city.

A mysterious tunnel~
Everything about this tunnel is out of place in the desert world of Narak. 
The tunnel is damp and cool, almost chill, and the neutrality of the city
above has been replaced by a dark, foreboding emptyness ahead.  No
comforting breeze blows; the air is still and heavy, like a tomb, but
from somewhere, the smell of incense and spice wafts its way to your
nostrils.  The tunnel almost seems alien, with the only familiar sight
being a small gray lever on the south wall.

On the east edge of a large sandstone building, a stairway descends down
to the streets below.  To the south, the southern half of Narak spreads
out before you, but the high walls of the city prevent any view of the
desert beyond.  The smell of coffee wafts through an open doorway to the
west, and to the north another of these small rooftop shops can be seen.

A Balcony on a Sandstone Wall~
On the east edge of a large sandstone building, a stairway descends down
to the streets below.  To the north, the northern half of Narak spreads
out before you, most notably the high-sloping gold domes of the palace
and the black turrets of the assassins tower to the northeast, and the
Wyvern Inn to the northwest.  Soft music lulls out of an open doorway to
the west, and to the south another of the small rooftop shops can be seen.

The Desert Song~
The western half of this small shop is dominated by a small stage, upon
which a few musicians play their lutes to the beautiful sound of a young
human female singing.  The other walls are adorned by hanging instruments
and posters of famous bards.  The smell of a coffee shop wafts in through
a set of swinging doors to the south.  To the east, the shop is exited
through an open doorway onto a sandstone balcony.

The M.T. Cup~
This quiet little coffee shop is quaint and has a cozy, friendly
atmosphere.  The sounds of "The Desert Song", the room to the north where
bards and minstrels play at most hours of the day, come wafting through
the swinging doors to the north and combine with the low din of happy
conversation of the shop's relaxed patrons.  The sights and smells of
coffees, soups, breads, and spices give the place a pleasant aroma to
match the pleasant mood.  A small sign is tacked up next to the counter,
and a small dartboard hangs on the wall.
~
nomob

The Laughing Lobster~
This shop, half on the roof of a much larger sandstone building and half
on a wooden balcony, is filled with the sounds and smells of boiling
lobster.  A hideous wooden sign depicting a lobster with a horrifically
large smile is hung in poor taste over the shop, above a table surrounded
by a few chairs.  A sturdy wooden staircase leads down to Aghrin Street,
and a wooden walkway leads across the street to another balcony opposite
this one.

Balcony above Aghrin Street~
No rooftop shop graces this wooden balcony over a score of feet above the
sandstone streets of Narak.  Instead the balcony takes advantage of its
marvelous view of the Sea of Light, the massive, endless ocean whose
waves are visible above the ciy gates to the west.  The scenic vista is
complete with a bench upon which you may rest your weary bones and an
overhanging tent flap to keep the sun from beating down upon you.  Small
wooden walkways to the west and south seem to lead to other balconies.

Narak - Underlevel~
The underlevel of Narak, while not as crowded and bustling as the
merchant city itself, is far from deserted.  The inhabitants seem to
value their quiet, however, as not much commotion is heard from any
direction save a faint din from above.  Small streets head to the north
and east into strangely cooler air, and a steel-runged ladder leads up a
vertical shaft toward the city proper, and down even further into
near-total darkness.  The underlevel is lit by hanging chandeliers of
glowing moss, attached firmly to the ceiling nearly 25 feet overhead.

Tourmalaine Chamber~
@b@CThis chamber is a sea of clouds and pale blue sky, a swirling marble
pallete of tourmalaine and white.  It is nearly a hypnotic effect as the
chamber seems to move rapidly through a noon tapestry, then rushing to a
halt, then spinning madly, all without the room actually moving.  A door
of similar composition stands to the south, while a door of swirling
