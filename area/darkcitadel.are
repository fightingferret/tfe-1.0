Before the Gates of a Dark Keep~
A mighty portcullis stands open to the north, allowing entrance within
the high stone walls of a fortress.  Not quite a castle, it has no
parapets or turrets to speak of.  Rather, it is some sort of massive
square tower, a citadel of some kind.  Dark clouds gather overhead in an
ominously dark storm, almost merging with the upper walls.

They look almost like ordinary storm clouds, complete with lightning and

A Massive Entryway Within a Dark Keep~
To the south is a massive portcullis, while all other directions take you
further into a large dark tower.  A large chandelier hangs from the
ceiling above you, its score or so of candles lighting the room
adequately.  The chandelier is the only reprise from the dark granite of
the walls.  The room is very cold, as not even a simple fireplace offers
warmth.  Open archways lead north, east, and west, heading further into
the keep.

A Dark Hallway Within a Dark Keep~
This dark hallway connects a well-lit room to the south with another
chamber to the north.  Something glows in the room to the north, but what
exactly it is you cannot tell from here.  The walls of this hall are made
of dark black granite, and feel chill to the touch.

A Dark Hallway Within a Dark Keep~
This dark hallway is barely illuminated, the only light source being to

west.

A Dark Hallway Within a Dark Keep~
The dark grey granite of the walls is cast in dark shadow, making it

west into darkness.  The granite is cold, even chill to the touch, and
each footstep echoes down the dark hall, seemingly endlessly.

A Chamber Bathed in Pale White Light~
The dark granite walls of this circular chamber are bathed in a pale
white light coming from a glowing white section of the north wall.  The
light pulsates and fills the room.  A dark hallway leads away from the
strange chamber to the south.

A Dark Hallway Within a Dark Keep~
The hallway bends to the north and west here.  To the north the hallway
continues into utter darkness offering no hints as to what lies in here. 
The walls are quite bare being nothing more than black granite with the
occasional crack in the stonework.  Off to the west a dim light faintly
illuminates the hallway.

The hall bends to the north and east here, disappearing into shadow in

seeming to drain both the light and the heat from the room.  A small
statue of some kind stands in the southwest corner.  Something is just
not right about it.

A Dark Hallway Within a Dark Keep~
The air within the hall is not still or stifling, yet something about it
is very oppressive.  The dark grey granite of the walls are made even
darker by the lack of torches in the wall.  In fact, there aren't even
any sconces on the walls at all.  Apparently whomever built the citadel
did not think that light was necessary.  The hall continues north and
south, while a small wooden door leads east.

No torches hang upon the walls of the hall, strange somehow, yet fitting

The End of a Dark Hall Within a Dark Keep~
The long granite hall comes to a dead end here.  Where the hall should
seemingly continue to the north, a candlestick is set into the stone wall. 
The stone of the north wall is somewhat different than the dark grey
granite of the hall, but only slightly, as if there was supposed to be a
match.  The hall continues for some distance to the south.

Above a Granite Stairwell~
A large set of granite stairs descends down and into a damp hallway.  An
open archway leads east onto a small dais of some sort.  What exactly the
purpose of the dais is or the nature of the room in which it is set
cannot be determined from this vantage.  From below you can hear the
sound of dripping water.

A Small Side Room~
The north and east walls of this small room are made of cold, dark

Darkness covers the hallway like a blanket, allowing very little of your

A Small Prison Cell Within a Dark Keep~
Lit by torchlight from the adjoining guard room to the south, this small
cell could almost be called cozy if it were not for the thick iron bars
locking you in.  Piles of hay lay scattered about, offering places to
rest, suggesting your wait could be a long one indeed.  Inscribed into
the wall by some long forgotten hand is the phrase: "welcome home." The
bars are wide enough set that you can probably look through it and see
what lies in the guard room beyond.

A Small Private Room Within a Dark Keep~
A small fireplace to the east offers light and a small amount of warmth
to this small room.  However the heat from the crackling flames seems to
disippate all too fast, absorbed by the cold granite walls of the room. 
The floor, on the other hand, is carpeted with a thick, plush velvet
material.  A small, circular altar stands in the center of the room, but
does not look to be sacrificial in nature.  To the west, a small wooden
door offers an exit to the room.

On the Battlements of a Dark Citadel~
A massive storm rages all about you, centered on the giant obsidian dais
to the south.  You stand on the battlements of a mighty citadel,
overlooking a drop of several hundred feet to the north.  Lightning
crackles and several bolts strike the dark granite walls, but they show
no signs of damage or wear.  You can continue along the battlements to
the east or west.

On the Battlements of a Dark Citadel~
High atop the dark citadel, the battlements overlook a few hundred feet
of empty air above the hard ground below.  To the north, a massive
obsidian dais rises in the center of the citadel.  Around you and the
rest of the citadel, a raging storm of electricity hurls itself against
the dark granite.

A Large Chamber Within a Dark Citadel~
A grandiose chamber looms around you, stretching far to the west and
south.  Murals are painted with precise detail on the domed marble
ceiling, and bookshelves line the walls.  The floor of the chamber is
also white marble, polished clean and remarkably free from wear.  To the
east, a spiral staircase extends a small arm to offer access up to the
battlements and down onto the ground floor of the citadel.

All the books lie out of reach, but many look old, rare, and expensive. 
It is quite a collection.

On the Battlements of a Dark Citadel~
A long ramp leads up to a massive obsidian dais to the east and into the
very eye of the swirling storm which rages around you.  Flashes of
lightning ripple and the deafening crashes of thunder surround you,
amongst the pitch black clouds and powerful winds.  The citadel holds
firm against the storm, as it shows no sign of wear.  Perhaps after all
it is the citadel feeding the storm, not the storm devouring the citadel.

On the Battlements of a Dark Citadel~
Darkness and cloud surround you, interrupted by peals of lightning and
crashes of thunder.  The dark granite of the battlements provide support
against the battering winds and rain.  To the northeast rises a dark
obsidian dais, unapproachable from this position.  A walkway leads around
the edge of the battlements to the east and north.

On the Battlements of a Dark Citadel~
Chaos rages in the form of billowing columns of dark clouds which swirl
about on powerful winds.  The dark granite of the battlements stand firm
against the relentless pounding of rain, thunder, and lightning, as sure
a defense against the violent apparition of nature as the citadel's walls
are against those who seek to besiege it.  A walkway leads east and south
along the edge of the top of the citadel, around a massive dias of
obsidian to the southeast.

The Room of the Darkgem~
This circular room is focused on a small pedestal in the centre of its
dark embrace.  A small beam of violet light shines down on the top of the
pedestal, illuminating it and casting its obsidian surface with a glow of
mystical qualities.  A small candlestick hangs on the south wall.
~
[Merior] the room is focused?
- i dont like the term - rooms dont focus - they have no eyes
[Phule] but the focus of the room is the pedestal
[Phule] hence the room is focused on the pedestal
[Phule] and cameras don't have eyes yet they focus
