Bridge over the River Elhanni~
A wide stone arch bridges the Elhanni's rough, choppy waters.  The
current underneath is powerful, and you feel its pull against the bridge
as it rushes against the aged stone supports.  To the west, a dense
forest has crept its way almost up to the riverbank, where it enters the
forest's dark mass.  Thick branches join with one another over the road,
screening the road's surface from the sky overhead.  To the 
east, the road heads up a slope back toward Chiiron.

At the Edge of a Dark Wood~
An unpaved road winds its way between twisted trees whose branches
twine far above your head in the darkness.  Holding your finger in
the air for a moment, you are unable to detect even the slightest of
drafts.  The still air is cool and moist, and your lungs are filled with
the pungent odor of toadstool and damp earth.  To the west, the road
leads further into the woods, seemingly swallowed whole by the shadowy
trees.

Edge of the Woods~
The edge of a forest unfolds about the area.  Looking south, the road
gradually becomes submerged in the depths of a stately wood.  To the
west, the forest gives way to open fields and meadows, and crosses a
small wooden bridge on the way to a small village.  Dark brush and thick
branches of the forest prevent your progress to the north.

A sign stands by the edge of a roadside.

The road passes through numerous fields and small gardens.  Low stone
walls line the sides of the road, the rocks piled up from years of
plowing the nearby fields.  To the west, a gradual slope leads down to
small plaza surrounded by a tight cluster of modest buildings.  Off to
the south, a gate leads into a carefully plowed field.

Village Green~
You are at the southeastern corner of a small village green.  A tight
cluster of small houses, shops, and outbuildings huddle around the little
plaza.  The green stands near the bottom of the large, bowl-shaped Rua
Valley, with high hills looming in the distance to the north, west, and
south.  A solid looking building lies on a small pond to the northeast,
and the pond is channeled to drive a large waterwheel.  To the east, a
road climbs the gentle rise into a thick wood.

A gnarled oak tree dominates this corner of the green.  Its wrinkled,

local landmark.  Near the tree is a small stone @bwell@n, partially
sheltered by one of the oak's great limbs, swinging slowly in the breeze. 
An aged iron lantern hangs from one of the great tree's limbs, swinging
slowly in the breeze.  The Valley Road branches off to the west from
here, and Mallander's Way intersects the green further to the south.

Looking around from your position at the northeastern corner of the
green, you can see Delving Lane branching off to the north, and the
Valley Road leading down to the west.  Laid out with a great deal of
care, the roads' straight angles suggest a level of importance belying
their current level of disrepair.  A solid looking building fronts the
green to the east.  Thick walls support a roof whose massive beams jut
beyond the eaves.

Delving Lane~
The lane slopes down slightly to the east, while off to the west it
approaches a range of steep, wooded hills.  High above the valley, the
forlorn hills spread out along the horizon, their thick tapestry of
greens and browns appearing at once distant and yet somehow quite close
at hand.

Delving Lane~
You stand at the edge of a range of steep hills.  The face of a 
sharply-angled cliff prevents the road's continued progress to the west. 
Dark brown lichens and moss grow into small cracks and crevices in the
rock, and scraggly brush clumps against the rise at the foot of the lane. 
To the north, the lane leisurely climbs up into the lower reaches of the
hills which ring the valley.  Back to the east, the road leads down
toward the valley floor.

Valley Road~
Finely-joined cobblestones lead east and west here along the ancient
Valley Road.  Once a thoroughfare of great importance, its place among
the great trade routes of the world has long since slipped away.  Only
its grey, weathered marvels of engineering remain, the tangible reminders
of a bygone era of local prominance and prosperity.

You stand at the terminus of an ancient cobblestone road, its level

stands off to the east, leading toward Pennan, while the road continues
on its lonely course west into the hills.

Greened Way~
Several large bushes grow along the edge of what was once a wide highway. 
More and more frequently, the meadow grass seems to give way to them,
until the Greened Way in places resembles only a wide, grassy path. 
Close by, the steep hilly slopes rise high above the dark growth which
crowds the edge of the trail.

The grassy ground of the Greened Way climbs slightly here, slowly moving
up from the valley floor and into the hills which encircle the tiny
village of Pennan.  To the north, the wooded slopes rises steeply, while
a thick tangle of vegetation prevents exploration to the south.

You are on the wide cobblestone avenue affectionately referred to by
locals as "The Way." To the north, the lane leads toward the village
green; to the south, the way continues its straight-line progress between
the tightly-arranged houses and fields of the valley.  A small stone
drain pipe emerges from the village green, emptying into a deep ditch
along the eastern edge of the road.

Mallander's Way~
Pennan's crumbled parapets loom high above you to the west, for the most
part somehow having remained standing despite years of disuse.  Running
roughly from west to south, the remains of the old town fortifications
impose an unnatural stone skyline upon the area, one which provides a
mute but uneasy counterpoint to the indifferent sky overhead.  Rising
above its neighbors, a single ancient and square tower stands off to the
south, the remains of a small keep built to control access to areas south
of Pennan and the Rua Valley.

no visible means of opening.

The Cardinal~
You stand inside the spacious central room of a country inn.  A blazing
hearth dominates the north wall.  A door to the left of the hearth leads
to a side room.  The windows are all closed, with long jagged nails
driven into the fine wood window sills.  A long bar runs along most of
the east wall, and behind it is a small door leading to what you would
guess would be the inn's back rooms.  Many chairs and tables are
scattered about the room, nearly all of them empty, the physical
reminders of a bygone, prosperous age.

Weatherworn Barn~
You have entered a small but sturdy barn.  It is clear that this
building, with its thick stone and oak components, was built to last a
long time.  A large pile of hay is against the east wall, and there are a
few empty stalls available for your use.  Some rusty nails have been
hammered into the north wall.

Stone Cottage~
You stand inside a small stone dwelling with simple furnishings and a
hearth which shows signs of a recent cleaning.  A pantry stands next to a
window on the north wall, and in the center of the room a few low stools
are arranged around a circular wooden table.  A coarse tapestry decorates
the west wall, its pastoral settings providing a heavy-handed attempt to
lighten up an otherwise drab room.

open up around you.

Before a Comfortable Hearth~
Stepping inside, you realize that the interior of the building is somehow
larger than what is physically possible.  A blazing hearth dominates the
west wall, with a few cozy oak chairs gathered by it.  You feel at peace
here, and somehow sense that little in this room has changed in quite
some time.  A soft feather bed is tucked into one corner, and an exotic
fur rug covers much of the marble floor under your feet.
~
Entering actions are to prevent sheep, chickens, etc.  from wandering in.

You have entered a small but sturdy stone building, less of a cottage
than a redoubt.  Jagged arrow slits leer in the half-light, having

table are the only indications that this building is used for anything
but military purposes.  Several wooden crates are stacked against the
east wall.

In a Humble Cabin~
This wooden cabin has managed, somehow, to avoid the destruction which
has ravaged so much of the valley.  The building has been stripped to its
bare structural elements.  The windows have been boarded up and nailed
shut, and the floorboards ripped up and stacked uneasily next to a small
stone hearth along the north wall.  Scores of holes in the walls and
ceiling attest to the poverty of the building's owners.

In a Small Yard~
You have entered a humble dirt courtyard.  An old stone fountain is in
the center of the area, empty of water and covered with soot and grime. 
There is a simple vegetable garden to the north, and a large field to the
west.  A manor house stands off to the northwest.

A waist-high sea of wild grasses billows in the breeze here.  This field

the soil.  To the northwest a range of steep, craggy hills looks down on
this tranquil spot.  A stone building, positioned close by to the north,
intrudes upon your reflections.

In a Humble Garden~
Plants grow in carefully designed columns in this small vegetable garden. 
The soil here is strangely harsh and unforgiving, and for all the
apparent care given to these plants, little has grown here over the
course of the last season.  South of here is a small dirt courtyard, and
to the west you see a plain but large stone hall.  A large stone wall
prevents movement to the north.

Farmhouse~
You have entered a large stone building in woeful condition.  The

flight of stairs once climbed the west wall, but little now remains of
them save for a few broken, splintered beams.  A few tables and bedrolls
are huddled against the west wall, opposite the dusty hearth.

some time.

weather a siege.  Nonetheless, the farmhouse's central chamber is a
comfortable place, possessing a generously-sized hearth and many cooking
implements, all neatly arranged along the north wall.  A large
rectangular table of fine oak sits in the center of the room, surrounded
by a half-dozen straight-backed chairs.  Several large wooden crates are
lined up along the south wall in a neat row.  A flight of stairs along
the east wall leads upstairs to the sleeping area.

The lane continues its progress through the lower reaches of the hills
which border the northwestern rim of the vale.  The shore of the lake is
quite close now, and you can see its clear cool waters ripple softly
in the incessant, circular valley wind.

Hillside Shelter~
Initial impressions of a natural cave give way to the realization that
you have entered a small shelter dug out of the hillside.  Sheltered from
the harsh valley wind, the little hovel is a comfortable enough spot,
with a small firepit cut into the floor near the doorway.  Small wood
chips and assorted debris lie scattered across the uneven dirt floor.

Faint Track~
The trail becomes faint here as it enters an area covered with waist-high
grass.  To the north, the trail leads into a rocky section of the hills. 
South of here, your eye follows the faint track deeper into the hilltop
meadow.  The grassy area continues to the east, while a steep rocky rise
to the west leads toward a wooded area.

out of the sides of the hill, exposed by the incessant erosion of wind
and rain.  The path leads north and south.

a gaping chasm opening up below you.  On the far side of the chasm, the
hills rise once again, this time far above you until they blanket the
horizon and disappear into the clouds.  The small trail continues east
into more open terrain, and down a slight slope into a gulley between
some hills.

Behind the Holly~
This narrow path is littered with chunks of dead wood and charred rocks.
No vegetation grows here, save for the pair of giant holly bushes to the
north.  The hillside rises high above you to the west, while to the east
the ground drops off toward the valley floor. Two large rocks block off
the western exit, though it looks possible to squeeze between them.  A
small path runs off to the south.

to rise above you to the north and west.  Hundreds of stones clatter
about your feet as you walk here, the stone of the hills worn and broken
down here by the ages.  Two large rocks block your exit to the east,

Very Narrow Path~
The path continues north and south along the edge of the steep hillside. 
Small scrub grows in the chinks between the rocks here.  To the east, the
hills fall away toward the valley floor far below you.  You see Delving
Lane winding its way between a few farms, and the shimmering waters of
the mill lake in the distance to the northeast.

Very Narrow Path~
A rocky overhang juts out here, nearly preventing your continued progress
along the goat path.  The trail, only a foot or so wide at best, winds
its way around the rocky shelf in a scissor-like motion.  To the east you
see the fields and farms of the Rua Valley spread out beneath you.

Two narrow paths converge at a rough stone ledge.  The rocky floor is
covered with small twigs and stones.  It appears that someone has made a
recent - and unsuccessful - attempt at a fire here.  Looking off to the
southeast, you see a small cluster of houses gathered around a small
square.  Rising high above you to the northwest, the rough walls of the
cliff tower above your position.

A narrow, rocky trail leads down a steep slope to the east, and climbs up
it toward a high outcropping to the west.  The passage of many feet has
worn a deep groove into the rock underfoot.  At the bottom of a steep
drop to the south, the narrow stone ribbon of the Greened Way moves east
and west along the valley floor.

Edge of a Gorge~
A stand of regal oaks cling to the edge of a steep gorge.  Their gnarled
roots dig into the rocky soil along the lip of the chasm, the ground
suddenly plunging downward toward the rocky floor far below.  A single
tree has fallen, the victim of a recent valley storm, and now lies nearly
horizontal, spanning the gorge.  The trunk itself is wide, and you think
that an agile person could make it across.  A deep, gaping hole signals
where the tree once stood.

Lightly Wooded Hills~
Rocky ground to the east of here gives way to a stand of old oak and elm
trees.  A few low bushes grow where enough light penetrates the elms'
branches, and a thick mass of thorny bushes prevents your passage to the

On a Rocky Slope~
Immense masses of exposed rock surround you on three sides.  To the
north, a small footpath climbs a rock slope in a careful, switchback
motion which avoids the largest of hazards.  South of here, another rocky
rises sharply above you.  To the east, the rough ground ends at a jagged
drop down to the floor of a deep gorge.  A few small rocks and patches of
moss grow underfoot, and you spy a thick stand of trees growing high up

the precipice to the north you spy several large iron rings which have
been driven into the stone ground.  A few old trees, their trunks covered
by creepers and vines, grow along the southern edge of the clearing.

Decayed Wall~
A crumbled stone wall runs west to south here, its surface obscured by
thick vines and thorny, crawling plants.  Scores of the wall's smooth
grey stones have, over time, tumbled to the ground below, littering the
area around its base with cracked stone shards.

Narrow Gorge~
Lush vegetation grows on floor of a rocky gorge.  Sheer walls to the east
and west tower above you, their jagged faces partially obscured by thick
colonies of lichens and spanish moss.  A small footpath leads north
through the carpet of thick grasses and bushes, while a dark curtain of
vegetation blocks passage to the south.

Footpath through a Gorge~
The ground here is moist, and a spongey carpet of moss has for the most
part replaced the tall grasses which grow off to the south.  The gorge's
walls are almost entirely covered with dark mosses and vines, and a light
mist clouds the narrow space between the rock walls about you.  As you
push through thick leaves and bushes, you see the footpath continue to

These apple trees are very old and worn.  Their bark has been smoothed
out by the many hands that have touched them over the years.  In one of
the trees a message has been carved.  Its words have been slowly worn

Abandoned Orchard~
You are near the canopied entrance to the orchard.  The aged apple trees
are covered by tangled vines and thick brush, as if no one has cared for
them in many years.  Sharp reeds grow next to the stream which flows
quietly to the west.  To the south an overgrown archway sweeps over
the small path leading out of the orchard.

Abandoned Orchard~
A large tree grows in this part of the orchard.  High in the air, its
branches hold many apples, ripe for picking.  A small stream flows
swiftly next to the orchard, flowing quickly by in a small ravine to the
west.  Across the stream you see a small village surrounded by plowed
fields.  From here, the village seems peaceful and quiet.

The ground slopes downward to meet the stream to the west of here.  The

In Front of a Shack~
This area of the orchard is filled with weeds and dead branches.  The
twisted trees form a dark canopy which completely blocks out the sky
above you.  To the north a small shack sits between two large trees.
The building is surrounded by several warped bushes, and is covered by a
mass of dark and twisting vines.  The door leading into the structure has
long ago dropped from its hinges to the ground, where it lies now with the
rest of the rotten lumber scattered about the area.

A Dead Spot in the Orchard~
The trees in this area seem to be slowly dying off.  The branches
overhead hold only wilted leaves where healthy apples should grow.  The
area is mysteriously devoid of birds and bugs, and nothing seems to move
in the branches overhead.  You notice pieces of a strange vine scattered
about in the trees.  A large hedge grows to the north and east,
effectively cutting off all attempts to travel in those directions.

In the Apple Tree~
You climb up the apple tree and gaze out over the valley floor.  From
this point you are able to see the entirety of the Rua valley.  The
village of Pennan lies a short distance to the west, while the remains of
this small orchard remain entirely on the east side of the small stream
running through the valley.  You notice that the forest has encroached
upon the area once held only by the orchard, and is slowly beginning to
destroy the apple trees in the process.

In a Deep Gorge~
You stand on the bottom of a gorge, amid scores of jagged rocks and an
almost overwhelming display of vegetation.  All about you, plants vie for
space with one another on the moist ground between the giant boulders and
nearby walls of the gorge.  To the east and west, the craggy walls of the
gorge rise high above you, their towering forms blocking out all but a
thin sliver of sky.  At the top of the gorge, you see a tree trunk which
lies across it, much like a bridge.  To the south of here, a dense tangle
of vegetation chokes the floor of the gorge.  To the north, the canyon
continues.

Before a Dark Cave~
You stand before the gaping maw of a cave.  Over time, huge section of
the hillside has over time split in two, leaving an opening suited even
for the largest of creatures.  Thick vegetation grows all about the area,
and thick mosses hang down over much of the opening, drifting slowly in
the slight breeze, hanging off of the many boulders scattered around the
area.

beyond your ability to determine.  The floor seems to slope downward to

Cave End~
The rough rock walls of the cave disappear into a deep veil of darkness. 
A slight echo and a rush of cool air suggest that the chamber is quite
large, even as you are unable to determine its actual dimensions.  An
almost stench of rotting flesh and urine penetrates your nostrils.  It
seems to emanate from a haphazard pile of rubble and matted straw to your

Below the Rocks and Roots~
You stand on a ledge in a series of nearly vertical caves and passages,
far below the rocky, windblown hilltop.  No roots penetrate the unworked
stone walls which surround you.  You think you hear the faint sounds of
running water, but are unable to tell with surety.

Dark Cavern~
You have reached the floor of a large natural cavern.  All around you,

Armor Smith's Workroom~
Bits of pieces of metal lie scattered about the floor, some even embedded
in the wall.  Only a gifted craftsman could create such a mess and still
fashion worthwile items.  Several tall lamps, wicks extending far down
into their basins, provide light for this out of the way corner.

Armor Smith's Workroom~
Work benches are sandwiched between the Masters platform to the north
and the south wall.  The tools are work-worn, the tables gouged by years
of abuse.  Small metal carvings of animals and plants lie scattered among
the heavy platearmor and platemail.

Side Room~
Deep reddish-brown wooden walls, boarded-up windows and only a few wan
sources of light create a dim ambience.  You stand in a medium-sized
chamber, perhaps once a secondary reception room or lobby but now
suffering from neglect.  A large hearth dominates the southern wall, to
the east of the doorway leading to the main chamber of the inn, while an
aged wooden counter protrudes from the eastern wall.  A narrow stairway
leans on the northern wall for support in its climb toward the sleeping
areas.  A dusty sign hangs from the wall.
