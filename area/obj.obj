this horn, which is crafted of purest black ivory.  A chain of mithril
connects to both ends and it is truly a fine piece of craftmanship

The chain sparkles the unique silver mithril is known for, and holds

E
8 gain~
Q  Do wearing items that add to the attributes help when gaining a level?

A  No, all inceases in hit points, mana and moves are made from you 
   permanant stats and not your modified ones. This alternative 
   made the most sense and is fair to everyone.
~
E
7 stat stats abil~
Q  What do the various ablities mean?

A  Here is a summary of the various stats and there usage.

   STR (strength) -    Psyhical strength of you character. This affects
                       how much you can lift, hold and which weapons you
                       can wield. People with high strengths get to_hit
                       and dam bonuses.
   INT (intelligence)- Mental capcity. Intelligence affects the amount of
                       mana you have and the rate at which you gain it
                       back.
   WIS (wisdom)      - Wisdom is how well you character can learn something
                       A character can have awesome mental capacitty and 
                       never master something. Wisdom is how well you
                       understand things.
   DEX (dexterity)   - Dexterity is how well you handle your body. The
                       lower your dex the more clumsy you are. Dex affects
                       mostly your moves and you move regeneration. Also,
                       characters with high dex's get AC bonuses.
   CON (constitution)- Constitution is the ruggedness of your body and it's
                       abilty to heal and deal with pain. Con mostly affects
                       hit points and hit point regeneration. You can be
                       the strongest or smartest but with lousy con you will
                       be dragon food.
    AC (armor class) - Armor class is simply how armoured you are, the lower
                       you ac the better armor you have and the less of a
                       chance you have of being hit. AC = 0 would be considered
                       very heavily armoured. There are 3 ways to improve
                       your ac. 1) get better equipment. 2) find items that 
                       magically alter you ac. or 3) some spells lower ac.

E
5 lang languages~
Q  Why can't I understand anyone.

A  Languages have been added for a couple of various reasons.
   First they can be fun and provide a whole new aspect of
   things to do besides killing. The also enhanced relations
   between members of your own race. But they can add difficulty
   and frustation.

   We are working on a way that will work everything right (yeah right)
   or at least offend the least amount of people.
~
E
4 quest~
Q  Quests?? Why am I not gaining experience.

A  We have add quests to the game to make it more challenging and 
   rewarding. The basic pricpal is this. On certain keys levels 
   before you can gain a level you must complete a task required 
   of you to obtain the level. This is a sense proves to the gods
   that you are worthy, some of the quests will be simple and 
   others may be hard. Idealily each quest should only be used once
   but realistically it would probably be used by many different 
   players. SO we ask you not to reveal the solution of the quests.
   At this time, we are asking for your word and will assume you
   keep it. The quest will reveal itself to you but if you 
   completely understand flag down a god and they should be able 
   to clarify it. SO don't be alarmed if you are not gaining xp
   that just means you have a small adventure awaiting.
~
E
3 money~
Q  What's up with the money system.

A  We have decide on a more realistic approach to the money sytsem. 
   Just as the dollar has many demonations ( ie. 1 5 10 20) we have 
   done the same here, but ours is based on copper pieces. All shops 
   prices are in copper pieces (except training room). Here's a summary
   1000 cp (copper) = 100 sp (silver) = 10 gp (gold) = 1 pp (platnium)

Q   Most mobs don't have money, then how do I get some?

A   In the beginning of the game money can be a problem. The local
    trader has agreeded to help. He will buy all the furs you can
    sell him. This should help you earn enough money to get started
    and to help you gain some levels.
~
E
2 skills skill~
Q  Are their Guilds?

A  There are no guilds here, gaining is automatic when you have enough
   experience. To get skills of you class (mages and Clerics refer above)
   or warrior or thieve skilsl you must seek out a training room and
   practice the basics, they mastering them is up to you.

   Do skills decline with no-use.
   
   No, once you have learned something it is yours forever.  
~
E
1 magic~
Q  How does the magic system work?

A  The magic system has been divided into two basic classes:
    1) Mage (Mage, Ranger, Bard, and Psionic)
    2) Cleric (Cleric, Paladin, Monk)
   To get and learn spells for Mages is like this. You start with a 
   spellbook. You find the scroll of the spell you want and are able
   to learn (type "abil s" to see which one you are able to learn).
   Once you find the scroll you must inscribe it into your book. To 
   do this you ( put scroll book ) then find a Mage's Lab (hint they
   usually are around magic shops) then pracitice that spell ( i.e 
   prac magic missile). Once you learn a spell, you must have the book
   to cast it, until you know it well enough (75%) then the book
   is recommend but not necessary.
   
   For Cleric class it is different, they derive the spells from their 
   Gods. To get a spell the person must sacrifice an object in an 
   altar, The more powerful the spell they more expensive the object
   needed. Once an item is sacrificed your God chooses a spell at 
   random to give to you.

   NOTE: You may notice a lag before the spell is cast. That is how it was
   designed. You must begin the incarnation and concentrate the  spell 
   will happen. To offset this loss in firepower mages and clerics will
   be given access to some fighter skills but only a few.

Orion appears much like a plain morning star, except for it's odd redish
metal that holds silver highlight.  It has been around a long time, and
legend whispers that it was crafted from a mote fallen from heaven.  It
has since become a symbol used by knights.

Dear Xanthic,
     My dear friend, I hope this letter finds you in good health, I hope
that G. has recovered from his illness and that he is feeling much
better now.  My research into a solution to this curse that plagues me
progresses well, and I feel that I am close to a solution.  The pain is
becoming unbearable and I feel it every waking minute these days.
Please provide this courier of mine with more of the same herbs and
potions, as they are all that relieves the pain.  If you have managed to
discover anything, your help will be much appreciated, my friend.  I
close this letter now to continue my studies.  
    
Your faithful friend,
 
Zarander

This huge altar has seen much use, yet it is fairly clean when compared
to the rest of the chamber.  The altar appears to have large grooves
carved into it that allow blood to run off and cover the sides.  The
stone of the altar is carved from one solid piece of dark red obsidion. 
Around its base, blood has collected and coagulated around it giving it
an almost smooth appearence where it meets the floor.

A short-sword, this small dark blade has an elaborate pommel of two

Looking closely, you find that its not a needle, but a very finely
crafted sword.  Its shape is slim and designed to poke through whatever
skin it can.  Also to your surprise, is the miniature motes of light that
seems to cascade off its blade as you move it through the air.

This Sword of the Gods is a full meter long, engraved with intricate,
ancient runes of Flight and Revenge.  On its smooth black hilt is the
distinguishing feature of the Swords of Power, the symbol of
Farslayer, a target.  You recall a verse from an ancient song that goes
something like: 

       @M@bFarslayer howls across the world,
       For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
       Vengeance is his who casts the blade,
       Yet he will in the end no triumph see.

Forged with two very distinctly different metals, this sword looks
ancient yet is brand new.  The fantastic etchings along the blade and
crossguard seem to move of their own accord.  The two metals compromising
the majority of the sword completely contrast each other.  The dark
swirls of metal seem to absorb all light while the silver portion seems
to glow with a brilliant aura.

A mace who's name you somehow know, but who's history you cannot find. 
The head is a massive ruby etched with strange runes unknown to the magic
researching you do.  The haft and pummel are interweaved silver and
adamantine, and is so large as to require two hands to heft.
   An artifact, there is no doubt.

The bow is less than a foot long, and is crafted of a fine piece of wood
harbored from the very heart of a magical oak tree planted and sewn by
the pixie which made it.  Laced with pixie dust, this bow appears to be

The scimitar possesses the everyday curves of a normal specimen, but its
size reveals that it is anything but ordinary.  Its blade stretches to
nearly five feet in length, and the blade itself is about an inch thick,
making it a very heavy piece indeed.  It would take great strength to
wield this weapon with any proficiency.

When looking at this altar, you see that for the most part it has fallen
into disrepair.  Strangely enough, the area within the sword engraving
seems to be in very good condition, almost as if something were recently
removed from it.  This carving is used to channel the blood from the
altar center to two large bowls, one to the tip and the other at the
pommel of the sword.  If you stare at the bowls long enough you swear you
see a berserk half-ogre gleefully swinging a sword around him, coming at
you from the blood.  You begin to wonder if anything can be worth the
price of disturbing the altar of this furious being.

Carved from a single emerald, this delicate bracelet is quite thin. 
Merely a half of an inch thick, the detailing carved into its green
surface is overwhelming.  Encircling the bracelet are engraved images of
fairies, woodland sprites, unicorns, and even leprechauns, playing in a
lush, woodland valley.

Several jagged, vein-like cracks run down through the center of this
relatively flat stone.  The edges of the stone are broken and crumbling. 
Though pitted and scarred on one side, the stone is completely smooth,
almost polished, on the other side.  A series of crude symbols have been
etched into the smooth side of the broken stone.
~
E
after~
All the edges of this slab of stone have a polished gleam to them, except
for the topmost edge, which is jagged and broken.  Also, the sides of the
slab are remarkably different.  While one face of the slab remains flat
and smooth, the other is rough and crumbling, as if it has been chipped
away from a larger piece of rock.
~
E
smooth surface~
The smooth side of this piece of stone is adorned with both hieroglyphics
and primitive writing characters.  If only there were more to go on of
either, the writings might be decipherable and might also prove helpful.

It appears to be a hand made book of many pressed parchment pages strung
together inside a cover of hardened dark brown leather.  It is quite old
and seems to have held up quite well over the years.  The parchment
inside must have been well cured and protected in the leather encasing as
it is only partially rotted and mildewed.  Much of the begining of the
book is lost to the mildew and rot, but nearing the end you find many
pages that remain at least somewhat legible.  Perhaps you could look at
the pages and find out what this book is about.

There is a small hamlet .....ienne nearby where we can barter our goodes. 
An advance scout in our group has seen montayns far to the east of this
great foreste.  We shalle earn enough coin guarding the lumber crews from
these woodlande animals to provision ourselves.  Mayhaps then we shalle

Several goode days we have spente in this woode.  The meat is sweet and
the ale stronge, filling our days with toyl and our nights with revelrie. 
We celebrate this week, for we earned our pay defending the lumber
workers from the attack of one bear of giante proportions.  Alas, we did
lose two of our band, thus do we rejoyce that the rest do live.  We
commit to memorye the names of our fallen comrades.  Kellestra Bladebright
and Romish One-eye.
  
This page ends somberly, no depictions, simply a flourish under the names

Many days have passed since I have had tyme to write in my journal of
days.  Work continues as the hamlet is expanded.  As people heare of it,
they flock to the chance of new frontiers hoping to be among the first to
find their goode fortunes.  Already the lumber workers have opened a
considerable swathe of the foreste, making more room as the hamlet grows
into a towne and providing ample lumber to build with.  Plan.....er way

zing how Medienne has grown in su.....ort time.  A wooden palysade
now keepes out the nuisance of woodland pests as the likes of boars and
does well to slow down the numerous grizzlies.....  One of the older
vilagers knows of the montayns our goodely scoute did spot those monthes
back.  We are told they are called by the name Dragonspire for the beasts
rumoured to dwell within.  The need for hired swords as ourselves
diminishes with every wall erected.  I deem we heade into the montayns
soon.

een nigh on a passing of the moon since I did last write.  We have
traversed the woodlands outside Medienne and it remains a deep wood
frought with danger and thick of trees.  Proudly we lay claime to another
grizzlie, owing to it none of my companions this time.  We have entered
the Dragonspire Montayns and trek now up steep slopes.  Today we did
almost lose one scout to a rockslyde most foul.  Our hopes remain high
that we may find unspoiled treasure ahead.

E
sixth~
Many days and yet no signs of gold or sylver.  Our spirits our low now
and we have much need of reason to rejoyce.  We did lose 12 brave men and
women to a foul snow beast most dyre.  An evil demon from our darkest
nightmares, standing nigh on 30 feet tall.  It had wyckedly sharpe fangs
and what arms, it did rip poor Kjeldon in half, chain byrnie and all.  As
we did flee, the demon did bring its mighty foote down upon the ground
scattering us like so many toss ball pins.  What I wouldn't give to be
holding a tankard of fine dwarven ale in master Dar-Khen's tavern just
now.  The wretched sight will be with me until the ende of my days, I am
sure of it.

We did lose another fine scout to a foul demon beast.  In his
unfortunate demise were we all saved as we heard the mighty demon's
bellows long before we did come to it.  We did flee again, and now have
truly no idea where we stand on these acursed montayns.  We have spotted
a vast green foreste to the east and will attempt to reach it, for we are
in dyre need of fresh meat and vegetables.
   
The page ends with a long list of names, presumably all the people who
have died to date in the mountains.  More continues on the @beighth@n

The grand foreste we have found is mighty indeed.  Since we have arrived
we have not lacked for meat or fruit.  The water here is as sweet as any

traveled many days through this ne'er ending jungle.  Still, we
want nought, for game is more than plentiful.  We did walk upon a deer
and walk right up to it with in ne'er fleeing once.  A strange lande, one
that perhaps has nought before seen.  the likes of human kinde.  As I
look around, I see alien trees that grows thrice again higher than the
highest tree I have ever seen.  I would that we had time and need for
such wood, that we might test our axe upon it, but we travel to find some
path home now and carry only what we need.  There are no trayls here, so
we forge our owne.
   
The epic saga continues on the @btenth@n legible page.

E
tenth~
It is strange indeed to see animals watching us with eyes that seem to
know us.  I did see a bird so blue that looked as knowledgable as you or
I and it does still chill me to the bone.  'Tis not natural for animals
to watch us so.  For days we have felt eyes upon us, yet we see no sign
of our watchers and must now conclude it is the animals themselves we
feel upon us weighing our very souls.
    
The page has sketches of birds, deer and trees surrounding the border. 
There continues more on the @beleventh@n legible page.
~
E
eleventh~
Strange and stranger, perhaps these animals are woodland spirits most
kind.  We do not hunt them any longer as we begin to find fruits layed
out before our trail as if picked and left for us.  Surely no animal
could have done as much, and there be none here in this untamed land but
us.  'Tis surely a sign of benign spirits most kinde.  We even see some
sign of their passage before us, a hoofprint here, bird tracks there
creating a trail of sorts.  At night we see signs of the trail still as
spirit lights in the darkness.  Soft glowing lights that seem to float on
the breeze in the distance.  Yet when we seek to finde the lights each
morning they be gone
   
The bottom page depicts a scene of dark woods with little balls of light
floating, suspended on the air between trees.  A @btwelfth@n legible page
continues after this.
~
E
twelfth~
We continue to follow our goodely spirits with faithe.  A few of our
bande did decide they be tricking us with demon lights to lead us to our
death.  The loudest of these, a man we did call Mikalei, did choose to
storm off into the foreste alone.  We did not see him again for two days,
and when we did find him, he was all but dead to us already.  He did live
barely long enough to speake to us of demon spirits who begin to take our
form yet are not wholey like us.  Claiming they did step out from the
very trees themselves and surprise him when he was but cutting wood for a
raft and be distracted.  Many have become nervouse at the thought of vile
demons among us.  Most believe his tales must be the fever dreams of a
dyeing man, as he did show no signs of wounds to us.  Still, we choose
to stick to the path our kind spirits do show to us.
   
More does continue on the @bthirteenth@n page.
~
E
thirteenth~
We did find a spring most clear, far sweeter than any we e'er knowest
before.  We did stop here a time to rest, until it seems our spirits did
want us to move onward.  At night we do be hearing the sounds of strange
beasts behinde us, and by day the foode gifts of our goodely spirits
appear slightly farther ahead of us.  Surely it be the will of our most
benign spirits that we move onward soon, for our owne good.
  
More continues on the @bfourteenth@n legible page.
~
E
fourteenth~
We have moved beyonde our spirits it seems, as they no longer leave food
for us every day.  We did talk some long time whether 'twould be beste to
be moving as the goodely spirits would have us, though they no longer be
with us, or nay.  In the end we did decide to move onward.  Tomorrow we
begin our journey through the woode, though it appears it grows less
grande with each passing step.  The most able of our men to scout did
report an ominous fog bank ahead, not unlike one we did once see by the
ocean.  If we can but finde ourselves by an ocean, we could crafte a boat
and sail our way home, I be sure of it.
  
The next page continues on legibly, being the @bfifteenth@n available
page.
~
E
fifteenth~
At first we did travel on slowly setting up small watch groups and watch
first trap.  We were pelted by small stones, and when we went to
investigate, three of our number were suddenly impaled by many sharpened
sticks thrown from out of nearby bushes.  We did try to catch the
culprits, but they did run, and in the gloomy mist did look unto us like
children by their size.  Among the first to fall was the last of our
brave band with any understanding of the healing artes.  Now we travel in
larger bands, beating bushes with stout clubs as we pass.  We have seen
no other sign of our attackers.
   
The bottom of the page holds three names, people who died in the attack. 
The next page is the @bsixteenth@n legible page.
~
E
sixteenth~
I lay here knowing dark deathe stalks me.  My blood is fire bourne of one
of those bedeviled demons who live in these trees.  Never again shall I
see by my eyes the wondres of this world.  I shall not see again my
chyldren and fear they will never know my resting playce.  The Rytes of
Angharra-Morr will not be performed over me.  Still I go to rest in
peace, for I have seen thryce over what my ancestors did dream to see of
this worlde.  This be my storie, these be my words.  Know me, for I was
Tan'chiel Secomberson, Realmswalker.
    
Nothing more continues.  What follows are a good number of pages that

2 examples five~
One of the best ways to learn is by looking at examples.  Rather than
writing the whole example here, I'll give you room numbers and such and
you can go there and check yourself.  Hopefully these will help you learn.
    
ROOMS - pick any room, look around.
        its a good idea to put obvious/noticable exits in the room desc
        Its also a good idea to put any major description features in
        into extras (AEDIT).
    
ROOM EXTRAS (REXTRA):
   
ROOM ACTION CODES (ACODE):
     
OBJECTS - pick any, check out their code.
          remember to use OEXTRA to give your object a description
          so players have some idea what your object is.
    
OBJECT CODES (OPCODE):
   
MOBS - there are so many to choose from.
       there are STANDARDS to help you balance your mobs so they fit
       appropriately into Forest's Edge.
     
MOB CODE (MPCODE): for attacks and other things.
~
E
3 mobs four~
Here is a list of help files that will help you with learning how to
create/edit mobs (monsters/creatures/npcs) 
    
MEDIT - mob edit. for creating/editing mobs.
MSTAT - mob statistics.
Fast info on a mob, or a player, after all, players are creatures too.
   
MSET  - mob set.  Changes settings found on MSTAT.
    
MFLAG - mob flags.
MFIND - to find the mnum of a mob.
MLOAD - to load a mob by mnum.
MWHERE  - find what rooms a mob is in currently.
RMWHERE - find what rooms a mob loads in.
MARMOR - mob armor.  See also ARMOR SYSTEM and A S
used to set the armor class of a mob.  This is NOT typical armor, it is
for things like tough skin, scales, etc.  normal armor can be loaded on
humanoid mobs via MRESET.
   
WRITE MOBS - saves all the mobs you were working on.
MPCODE - mob program code ?
This is the code that determines how your mob damages things and any
special attacks it may have.
    
MPDATA - data for MPCODE
MPEDIT - switches to and between various MPCODEs on a mob.
The initial MPCODE will be a mobs attack program, by using MPEDIT you can
create other codes for the mob.  These codes can be used to make a mob do
something when a player comes in, at random occassions, or even to
respond to a players actions or presence of an item/player.
~
E
3 objects three~
Here is a list of help files that will help you with learning how to
create/edit objects (objs)
   
OEDIT  - object edit.  For creating/editing objs
OEXTRA - obj extras.
This is what you use to give your object its basic description (and the
little special extra ones) that players see when they look at it.
   
OSTAT - obj statistics.  An objects basic info.
OSET  - obj settings.  For changing OSTAT info about your obj
OFLAG - obj flags.
OFIND - obj find.  To find objects.
OLOAD - obj load.  To load objects.
OWHERE - finds which rooms objects are located in.
OPCODE - Obj Program Code ?
This is how your object 'does' things.  ie how weapons do damage.
    
OPDATA - data for your OPCODE.
   
WRITE OBJECTS - saves the objects you have worked on.
~
E
4 rooms two~
Here is a list of help files that will help with learning how to
create/edit rooms.
    
DEDIT - for Door Edit.
Actually this is the means of creating new rooms, connecting them to
other rooms, and cratinf connections (be they actual doors or the
adjoining section of two fields, etc) 
    
REDIT - for Room Edit
This is where you give your room its description and where you give it
all the little extra descriptions that players use to look at items
listed in the description that are not actually objects.
  
RSTAT - room statistics.  A lot of useful info quickly.
RSET  - room set.  For setting some RSTAT info.
RFLAG - room flags.
RNAME - room name.  The first thing anyone sees in a room.
RBUG  - room bugs.  little notes in rooms only the imms can see.
    
AEDIT - action edit.
ACODE - action code.
These allow your room to do things to the players, or lets the players do
things in your room.  ie people will take damage when they enter your
room due to a trap, people will take damage if they stay in your room due
to the toxic fumes, a player can activate the magic disc that effectively
teleports them into a different room.  This is a very useful thing to
understand.
    
ADATA - action data.  Data for use with your ACODE.
ASTAT - action statistics.  pertinent info about actions in a room.
ASET  - action set.  change facets of an action noted in ASTAT
AFLAG - used for setting directions on entering/leaving actions
    
WRITE - saves all the rooms in the area you are in.
~
E
3 immortals imms one~
As a new immortal there a few commands you may benefit from already.
This tome is not intended to teach you all of them, merely to help you
find many of the ones you will need more readily.  Most of these have
help files that will go into far more detail.
   
type:  help <WORD DESIRED>
HOLYLIGHT - this will greatly enhance your ability to see the world.
COMMANDS - shows you the various command categories, most of which have
           help files.
BAMFIN / BAMFOUT - what everyone sees when you goto or leave a room.
                  just more cool imm stuff.
MAP - so you can see an area, helps keep from getting lost.
IDENTIFY - like the spell, allows you to see more about an object
         while this works, the objects chapter can help you learn more
INVIS - makes you invisible/visible to players.  current policy is
       that imms level 93 and 94 remain invisible.
       makes sense.  you can't alter other peoples' work, so all you
       do is taunt players who see you by saying 'nope, I can't fix that'
GOTO - teleports you to someone (by name) or some room (by number)
       also works by room names, among others.

six fight~
MPCODE is the command to access a mobs fighting program.
  
The 2 most common commands you use will be:
     attack_weapon( mob, victim, 1d6, "left hook" );
     attack( mob, victim, 2d5+2, "sword thrust" );
   
attack_weapon uses the damage for the weapon, the 1d6 and "left hook"
are the defaults it will use if the mob is disarmed.
  
attack uses the 2d5+2 and "sword thrust" as the actual attack.  Is
commonly used for natuarl attacks, boar's tusk gore, kick, etc.  Attacks
that can't be disarmed.  If you use attack with a weapon, be sure to
include an if statement checking to make sure they have the weapon.  If
they don't (either it didn't load or was disarmed) they should not be
getting special attacks with a weapon they don't have.
    
Special Attacks..  most mobs over level 5 have a special attack that hits
about 20% of the time.  There are 2 ways to do this.
The short, easy way:
  if( random( 1, 5 ) == 1 )
     attack( mob, victim, 2d10+5, "bear hug" );
  
Or the longer, cool description way:
   if( random( 1, 5 ) == 1 ) {
     i = 2d10+5
     act_tochar( #bear_hug, ch );
     act_notchar( #rbear_hug, ch );
     dam_message( victim, i, "bear hug" );
     inflict( victim, mob, i, "bear hug" );
     }
    
where #bear_hug and #rbear_hug refer to mpdata strings that describe the
action in more detail for the player and those around him or her.

find the left hand pages covered in strange writing like none you have
seen before.  On the right hand pages you see vibrant, life-like pictures
that almost seem to be windows into the places they view.  Many of the
places are unfamiliar to you, some you know.  Among the places you
recognize you see pictures of the fountains of @GChiiron@n, @GMedienne@n,
and @GKha-Da@n.  You also see one that seems to show some kind of
@Gspring@n welling up out of a rather large tree.  You see another of a

Cracked and torn this once leather bound book has seen many owners.  It's
cracked binding threatens to give way at anytime and it's worn and ripped
pages dangle precariously from the tomb.  As you carefully open the book,
you notice see that this is the history of the ogre race.
     
Throughout time the ogres have always been here.  Although we have been
harrassed and persecuted by most other race of the world, for they fear
our strength.  We have managed to survive though with the help of our
allies, the Trolls, Lizardmen and Kobolds and still we were always
defeated, until Korthax came.  He was a great warrior and favored by our
gods.  They blessed him with special powers that no warrior among our
kind has eaver had.  He became leader of us and led us forth into the
world.  Under his rule we conquered many of the human and elvish lands and
claimed them as our own.  It was a great time for us, we had pleasures
not known by any ogre before available to us.  We could loot and pillage
to our hearts content.  Then on the eave of our greatest victory, the
conquer of Medienne, a dishonorable elf slaughtered our leader while he
slept.  Morale crumbled, but we attacked anyway.  We burned and sacked
part of that human town but to no avail.  It seems that all the races had
joined against us and our allies thus driving us back into the swamps. 
The ogres fled to a conquered town now known as Denab-Knur.  We mourned
our leader and were told a way of returning him to the world.  It is said
that when he returns, Korthax the Darklord will bring about a Crimson Age
for the ogres.  None of the races shall be spared and we will assume our
rightfull place on the throne of the world.

You see an aged piece of parchment with tattered edges.  There is strange
writing on it, and while you can read it, you can't remember what it says. 
Perhaps if you recited it, something magical would happen.

The black rock looks small, but is somehow massive, perhaps more massive
than the miles of earth beneath it.  Its black surface is gleaming, and
on it is a perfect copy of the night sky; the stars and moons all present
in balance.  Or perhaps is the truth of the matter that the sky is the
copy, the stone the original?  As you break eye contact with the stone
you see a flicker of red mar its surface.  A shooting star.  As the star
crosses the rock's surface it leaves a misty trail of stardust which
reads: 'Hollow'.

Shelves line the walls and stand freely from wall to wall filled from top

Individually, these small iron constructs look harmless enough.  Each is
made of 2 or 3 strips of thin metal twisted about each other, looking
very much like a child's toy jack.  However, these have had their pointed
ends sharpened and when dropped, tend to do a very good job of annoying
any pursuers.

The size of an ogre's fist and absolutely flawless, this blood-red ruby

Finely crafted from hardwood oak, stained to a rich dark brown and
laquered for protection this is not your typical fusbal table.  The
little playing persons have been carefully carved to resemble many of the
fine players here on Forest's Edge.  The rods binding them are made of
gleaming mithril etched with arcane runes of binding.  The counting beads
are formed from the bones of some of the realms strongest mobs, lending
the game an air of danger.  On either side, airbrushed onto the sides are
scenes from all walks of life here.  It seems to be inviting you to
@Gplay fusball@n.

The sabre's strange hilt differs greatly from the blade and scabbard,
which must have taken years and months to perfect, respectively.  It's
sharkskin-wound surface is irregular, yet seems to fit perfectly into
your hand.  A feeling of ancience, of peace emanated from it; upon
examining the pommel the source of the emanations is made clear: the
sharkskin is wrapped around the ancient bone of a dragon.  While the
blade itself is not magical, the hilt could give strange powers to its
wielder.

sabre blade~
The sabre is a masterpiece, the result of a smith's life's dreams and

a razor's edge point for the ending thrust in a duel.  The blade's
scabbard itself is finely carved, made of a solid log of oak, sanded and
stained to dark brown perfection.  No engravings mark the blade as
magical, signifying rather its mortal perfection.  A strange feeling
emanates from the strangely-wound hilt, which marks it for further
inspection.

The crystal is a single tine broken off from its natural cluster.  Its
color seems to shift slightly with the lighting, varying between the
blushing pink of an early morning dawn to the dusky purple of evening. 
Though you see some flaws within the crystal itself, you are surprised by
its inate toughness as you are unable to break it.

For the formal duelist, the flamberge (wavy) blade is a popular and
flashy choice.  It is thought to produce a more deadly wound, and
certainly looks as if that is the case.  When parrying with the blade,
the opponent's blade is slowed considerably and the vibrations produced
on the opponent's sword could often make him/her drop his/her weapon. 
The helt is swept silver, while the thin, gleaming blade is spotless
steel.  The wire-wrapped grip could leave some room for comfort, but is
functional.

This two-hander is slightly larger than a hand-and-a-half sword, but is
relatively lighter and faster than its larger descendents.  The lengthy
steel blade gleams in the light, and the grip is wrapped with durable red
cord.  With the development of plate armour, this type of sword was
needed to crack and dent the armour of the heavy knight of foot soldier,
and can even be used as a lance if grabbed by the blade.  There are even
cases of the sword being swung by the blade using the pommel as a mace.

A round flat top falls almost straight down for a tight fit on all sides,
coming down well below the chin in front but leaving the knight slightly
exposed at the nape of the neck.  This particular helm has brass
reinforcing bands in a sword shape pointing down across the front of the
helm, with the crosspiece centered around the two eyeslits.

Wielded by the biggest, burliest and sometimes most flamboyant mercenary
troops, these massive two-hand swords are used to break the opposing
army's front line or simply crush an unwanted adversary.  The fearsome
flamberge (waved flame) blade inspired fear, and the large, leather-bound
ricasso above the hilt and below a second crosspiece allowed for even
greater leverage when charging enemy soldiers.

This attempt to combine the rapier with the military broadsword met with
varying degrees of success, depending upon the swordsman who wields it. 
Forged of high-carbon steel, the blade is long, thin, yet strong enough
to pierce all but the strongest of plate armours.  The leather grip
provides comfort and stability, with the pommel and guard both of brass.

The unusual combination of design elements in this military-style sword
made it very popular across the continent.  The sword has a single-edged
blade which is coveted because it is easier to make and becase the single
edge can be made sharper due to the longer angel of the bevel.  The long,
straight profile provides excellent cutting power, but with a thrusting
point.  The blade length--37 inches--was carefully chosen to be ideal for
a calvaryman, but not too long for use by infantry.  The simple, recurved
crossguard and knuckle bow protect the hand without being cumbersome, and
there is even a finger guard should the wielder's finger be extended over
the crosspiece.  All in all its a streamlined, well-thought-out sword
design which fighting men of all stations prize.  The grib is wood wound
with leather.

The hand-and-a-half sword represents a strategic advantage in close
combat weaponry.  With improving armour and thicker mail and even plates
protecting knights, weaponsmiths countered with this larger and slightly
heavier than standard blade.  The longer handle makes it easy to use two
hands when advantagous, but the weighted pommel balances the sword so
well that one hand can be used to effectively wield the blade.  The
crossguard, pommel, and blade are steel while the hilt is leather-wound
wood.

The war hat is universally popular, although worn primarily by the
usually under-equipped footsoldier.  Eminently practical, the wide
sloping brim protects the soldier from millies and blows from axes or
swords.  Coupled with a mail cowl, it gives superb protection, great
visibility and unhindered breathing.

One of the most devastating short swords ever made, the wide, inward-
curving blade of the falcata delivers a tremendous blow and can split
both shield and helmet.  The steel blade is joined at its wide base by a
solid brass handle with a strange, yet functional, recurve.

The long, sweeping blade curve is superb for drawcuts and lethal for

This is a big scimitar, with a curving 11-inch hardwood grip designed for
two hands, but the balance is such that it can easily be swung with one. 
The sweeping curve of the blade is 34 inches long, forged from mithril
and steel.  Both the pommel and the guard are of solid brass, while
indecipherable runes are etched along the length of the blade.

To all who visit here, be warned.  This area is an experiment of the
wizards of the Tower.  If you have urgent business with them, procede to

The black rock looks small, but is somehow massive, perhaps more massive
than the miles of earth beneath it.  Its black surface is gleaming, and
on it is a perfect copy of the night sky; the stars and moons all present
in balance.  Or perhaps is the truth of the matter that the sky is the
copy, the stone the original?  As you break eye contact with the stone
you see a flicker of red mar its surface.  A shooting star.  As the star
crosses the rock's surface it leaves a misty trail of stardust which
reads: 'Whisper'.

About 5 inches in diameter, this large medallion feels cold and weighty
in your hands.  Although in reality perhaps only weighing a pound, the
medallion seems to bear down toward the earth with a much greater force,
as if more than gravity tugs at its blue-metal surface.  The metal itself
is most strange - not quite platinum, although its dull shine is
reminiscent of it.  There is an odd, dark blue hue to the silvery gleam,
and the metal itself seems to change tint in waves of darker and darkest
blue.

A large leather-bound book shows signs of great wear and tear.  Its cover
contains a drawing of a pentagram, with several other magical devices
around it.  On the inside cover you can just make out the word Zarander,
written in red ink.  The contents of the book are all written in some
strange, indecipherable tongue.

About 5 inches in diameter, this large medallion feels cold and weighty
in your hands.  Although in reality perhaps only weighing a pound, the
medallion seems to bear down toward the earth with a much greater force,
as if more than gravity tugs at its blue-metal surface.  The metal itself
is most strange - not quite platinum, although its dull shine is
reminiscent of it.  There is an odd, dark blue hue to the silvery gleam,
and the metal itself seems to change tint in waves of darker and darkest
blue.

The strange metal of this dagger's composition glows an odd black, almost
blue or purple-black.  One can almost see through it, as it appears to
have an almost translucent quality to its edge, as if it does not exist
solely in this place of existence.  The handle and the blade are one
solid piece, a strange weapon indeed.

Carved from a sapphire the size of a walnut, the iridescent jewel
sparkles like a star in the midnight sky.  The surface of the jewel is
flawlessly smooth and its interior is of a rich blue color.  The jewel
has been cut in a starburst pattern, so that any light the gemstone
catches is immediately reflected, giving the jewel a shimmering look. 
The jewel looks to have once been made specifically for a jewelry setting
or some other type of ornamentation.

the pelt, feeding on the skin beneath.  The underside is rough, and
unfinished, and would serve little practical purpose in this form.

This tunic has been woven from a roughly spun cotton.  Many cotton
strangs protrude from both inside, and out of the tunic, making it look
almost fuzzy.  You imagine that while initially donning this garb, it
would seem itchy, yet would also provide protection from the cold winter
weather.

This menacing weapon of the unholy warrior can be an extremely
destructive one in the proper hands.  A foot and a half of polished oak
is its handle.  On one end of the handle a small leather thong is hung,
to be wrapped around the wrist and to thus avoid being disarmed of the
weapon.  Off the other end of the handle sprout two chains, each about 2
feet in length.  At the end of each chain is suspended a small iron ball,
covered with spikes, able to flay the flesh from the wielder's victims. 
The handle has been given a dark, almost black, finish.  You can barely
detect the faint remains of runes which were carved into the handle
perhaps a century ago; whatever was written there has long since
succombed to time's wear.  However, the flail still seems to have a soft
glow, as if all of the magic of the runes has not worn off.

You wipe a thick layer of dust from the cover to reveal the word

brittle pages of dried skin covered in a flowing script, the ink a red so

Perhaps you could learn more by looking something under the different
headings.
   
The different topics seem to include:
  
          introduction ... just that
          overview ....... flags for all your undead
          zombies ........ not your average corpse
          skeletons ...... not just for closets any more
          miscellaneous .. what else is left?
          appendix ....... death traps
~
E
5 introduction~
There are many types of Undead, ranging from your mindless zombie to your
vengeful ghost.  This tome was created to help resolve some of the
confusion surrounding the undead, in particular, your place among them.
Worried?  Don't be.  You haven't just been recruited into the ranks of
the lifeless, thats a choice you get to make all on your own.  What your
place among them entails is the responsible creation of possibility that
will allow the mortals to delve into the art of Necromancy.  To put it

more plainly, this tome is a good guideline for the type of undead you
should be creating to attach to your mobs.
   
By now, you should have noticed that all mobs come with a skeleton and
zombie slot.  Go ahead, take a look now.  As a responsible builder, you
should create the corresponding mobs to fill those slots, or use
appropriate existing undead to do so.
   
Not all mobs can be raised into the ranks of the unliving, however most
can.  Use good judgement and sound reasoning to decide what few shouldn't
have those slots filled.  (Are you lacking good judgement or sound
reasoning?  Look for our book Common Sense 101 at a retailer near you) 
Most importantly, follow the guidelines. Consistancy is paramount.
~
E
3 zombies~
Zombies should have stats = 1/3 the level of the donor mob, however they
should have their actual level set to 1/2 the donor mob's level.
 
Fill zombies' zombie slots with their own mnum (can be reraised)
  
Fill zombies' skeleton slot with skeleton from donor mob.
   
set slow flag (unless donor was fast, don't set fast flag though)
   
set has_eyes flag (it has them)
  
set Infravision on (ie, a low level ability to sense life)
  
These are the lowest level of undead and not immune to much so,
low level fire / cold resist, and elec resist only slightly better.
   
Set marmor low as they do not defend themselves.
~
E
4 overview~
Just about all undead have certain characteristics that are the same.
These are the rules most undead should follow:
  
Sleep-resist flag on,
Poison resistance to 100% and poison resist on,
Mind resistance set to 100%
  
Zero_regen flag on (undead don't heal.  The undead players can raise,
(Those undead created by players can be reraised by them reinvesting the
energy to create them again). 

wimpy off (except for undead that have independent will)
(player created undead are stupid and feel no pain/fear)
  
include the name Undead in keywords.
  
Do NOT set skellies and zombies to aggressive, this allows players to
create serious death traps (see the appendix).
~
E
3 appendix~
Undead as Death Traps....
  
The reason it is best not to set the undead players can create or control
to Aggressive, is that it allows the players to create Death Traps.  As
the spirit of the game is fun, and Death Traps are not allowed, it is
simply better to make player created undead non-aggressive.
  
How can players do that with aggressive undead you ask?  Player JoeBob
gathers his 3 zombies from nearby corpses and moves them just outside the
city gate and releases them from his control.  Now these 3 zombies
(probably a bit slow on the uptake) will just sit there waiting to eat
the next traveller coming out the town gate.  Most zombies are slow and
JoeBob knows this, so he goes and gets three more zombies and orders them
into the room with his former 3 fiends.  After releasing his latest pack,
we now have 6 zombies waiting at the town gate for some hapless victem. 
but wait, theres more...  from 6 to 9, to 12 ...  granted he may have
trouble getting more than 12 there unnoticed, but you never know.  Last
thing we need someone dieing because they walked into a room with a score
of undead and were dead before they could bat an eye.  True, they could
have simply looked ahead, but how many bottlenecks are left along the
trails still?  Undead hordes blocking the trails are just a nuisance best
avoided.
  
The simple solution...  make them non-aggressive.  They lose their owner,
and they just stand there and drool waiting for there next command.
~
E
3 skelletons skellies~
Skeletons should have stats roughly equal to 2/3 the level of their donor
mob, however their actual level should be given as equal to that of the
donor mob.
   
Don't fill their zombie slots (can't replace missing muscle or downgrade)
   
Fill skeltons' skeleton slot with their own mnum (can reraise)
  
Set Slow/Fast flags to same as the donor mob.
   
do not set has_eyes flag
   
set Infravision on
set see_invisible on  (effective sense life, how else do they see us?)
  
Set fire/cold/electrical to slightly better than zombie counterparts.
   
Set marmor low as they do not defend themselves.
~
E
3 miscellaneous~
Having covered the 2 types of undead players can create, this is
basically a foot note to cover some of what remains.
  
Remember to set immaterial/ethereal undead (ghosts, banshees, etc) to
no_bash on.
  
Use common sense.  While Mummies wouldn't feel cold or electricity, you
gotta know they make a great road flare, so they shouldn't have a high
fire rating.

This stone tablet looks very old.  Its edges are somewhat chipped and it
has a series of cracks running through it.  In fact, at some point, the
tablet looks to have been mended from four broken halves.  Towards one
end of the tablet is an ebony black pearl, which seems to pulsate and
absorb the light around it.  A series of pictures and markings adorn the
smooth front surface of the ancient tablet.
~
E
after~
Judging from the cracks coursing through it, this tablet has been
constructed from several smaller pieces of stone.  At one end of the
tablet, there is a rare, ebony black pearl that is said to aid those who
seek enlightenment in their trials.  Three different systems of writing
appear on the smooth front surface of the tablet.  The first is a series
of hieroglyphics, followed by a much more complex and flowing style of
hieratic.  Following those two is a very crude form of humanic.

Mending together from eight sections of stone, this stone circlet is

Enfolding the pearl and pressed against its surface is a midnight black
orchid.  If worn, the pearl would rest directly over the middle of one's
brow.
~

There is something unusal about this stone circlet.  Though crafted from
sections of curved stone, it is lighter than in ought to be.  Also, the
gleaming pearl inset within it and enfolded by a midnight black orchid
seems to undulate slightly as light passes over it.  Surrounding the
circlet is an air of knowledge and power.

Several jagged, vein-like cracks run down through the center of this
relatively flat stone.  The edges of the stone are broken and crumbling. 
Though pitted and scarred on one side, the stone is completely smooth,
almost polished, on the other side.  A series of crude symbols have been
etched into the smooth side of the broken stone.
~
E

This relatively flat stone is about three inches wide.  Weathered and
pitted with age, the back surface of the stone has several deep cracks
running through it.  The stone itself is irregular in shape.  However,
two edges adjacent to one another are polished and smooth, like the
'front' surface of the stone.  The other two edges of the stone are
broken and jagged, as if it had been broken apart from a much larger
piece.
~
E
front surface~
Adorned with a series of hieroglyphics, the heavy slab of stone looks to
be part of a much larger piece.  In fact, on the front of the stone, on
the polished side, there are numerous hieroglyphics.  The hieroglyphics
stream across the jagged edges of the stone, as if there was once more to
the hieroglyphic tale.  In fact, this piece of stone appears to be the
lower left portion of a much larger stone tablet.

This carved stone head has been chiseled from a chunk of grey stone and
weighs about four times that of a human head.  The features of the
sculpted head are those of a feline.  Its graceful visage and alien
beauty are definitely feminine and the eyes speak of infinite wisdom. 
Whomever carved this piece of stone clearly was blessed with a vision of
loveliness.  The neck of the stone head is a bit rough and jagged, as
though it were broken apart from a larger piece or was meant to be

Durable yet supple black leather has been carefully stitched into a pair
of surprisingly fashionable breeches.  They are somewhat form-fitting and
supple enough to move with you.  Fine double-stitchwork along all the
seems provide insured security that they will hold up through a rigorous

A pair of rugged black leather boots made to look stylish as well as
serve a purpose.  The normally thigh-high boots have had their tops
turned down so that they rest about mid-way up the shin.  The toe of the
boots has been tipped in a thin lacework of silver to provide a bit of
flair.

The book's cover is made from stiff, dark brown leather.  Bold print on
the binding reads "Tad's Tales of Woe".  The pages contained within the
book are all fresh white pages and easily flexible, showing that this is
no ancient tome.  The book is, however, quite copious in volume, and
reading its entirety would take quite some time.  A strand of ribbon
marks a section nearly to the end of the book.

sorrow2~
@MI tell you now a tale of sorrow, a tale of woe, a tale of a time not long
ago.  Listen well and learn it all, before wretched fate on you can fall.@n
~
E
sorrow3~
@MIn this very age, these very days there lives a man in an addled haze. 
His heart was pure, his love was true but in the end fate had its due. 
Alone he walks the streets unsought, his mind rare holds a fleeting
thought.  For in a fit of rage and ire, a witch did cause his love's
expire.@n
~
E
sorrow4~
@MIn old Medienne does our story start, where brave Dulaine did lose his
heart.  The maiden fair Mirelle Dunney he courted nigh a year they say. 
When the year did end and her sire said nay, to young Chiiron they fled
away.  Off they went, their fortunes to make, for they fled with nought,
only love did they take.  @n 
~
E
sorrow5~
@MThe work they found was demeaning and cruel.  In the days they went
hungry and at nights they supped gruel.  In the forge of hunger they
lived only on heart, and that was where their ways did part.  For Dulaine
learned strength and courage, into the wilds he'd hunt and he'd forage. 
For Mirelle became vile, sick, twisted and more, she'd taunt the blind
and steal from the poor.  @n 
~
E
sorrow6~
@MA goddess of goodness brought change and brought right.  Dulaine
grasped the hope, Mirelle fled from the light.  Dulaine prospered and
grew in his newfound rejoice, yet Mirelle suffered and payed for her
dubious choice.  With their destinies sundered they soon parted way.  One
for far mountains and one for to stay.  Mirelle found her home in a far
craggy peak, her body now twisted for her actions so bleak.  @n 
~
E
sorrow7~
@MDulaine now made home and hearth of the wood, around young Chiiron all
knew him as good.  It happened one season dire wolves came to call,
Dulaine rose to the summons and nearly slew all.  As the last one lay
dieing it lashed out and bit, poor Dulaine fell afoul of its wild fit. 
With a grievous wound and truely much gore, Dulaine nearly died, he
nearly breathed life no more.@n 
~
E
sorrow8~
@MA kind passer-by, a healer by trade, found poor Dulaine, dragged him
off to a glade.  She tended his wounds, his pains did allay.  She
exhausted her skills working hard night and day.  Then again was he
wounded; Dulaine did awake, but death drew no nearer, his heart she did
take.  In that moment of silence, in that first simple glance, drowned by
her essense he stood not a chance.@n 
~
E
sorrow9~
@MTheir courtship was brief, not a month did it last.  True love was
involved and their fates had been cast.  Hellena, the healer, and
Dulaine soon wed, and as far as that goes that's all need be said.  They
spent several months in kindness and bliss, ending each day in a gift or
a kiss.  Mirelle soon got wind of Dulaine's newfound life, and twisted
by anger she murdered his wife.@n 
~
E
sorrow10~
@MNot with blade or with poison did she do the vile deed, she uttered a
curse and that was the seed.  Hellena soon fell afoul of a snake, that
happened to bite her as she swam in a lake.  The snake was far stronger,
Hellena's defeat.  Dulaine was away hunting deer for their meat. 
Returned from the hunt, Dulaine came home late, only to hear of the death
of his mate.@n 
~
E
sorrow11~
@MDulaine in his grief, was never the same.  He no longer hunted his
skills grew quite lame.  They cared for him then, the people in town.  He
once was their hero, though his luck was now down.  In his grief did he
ail, and Mirelle came to look.  When she left, a red ring, a momento, she
took.  A gift from his love, he nearly went mad, when Dulaine found it
missing, 'twas all that he had.@n
~
E
sorrow12~
@MI hear he still roams trapped in that state, thus ends his tale in
madness and hate.  All tragedy starts where all hope does end, what fate
makes so wretched, nothing can mend.  @n

An ornate crosspiece protects the hands, but appears to resemble nothing

A relatively thin book, it appears the cover accounts for about half its

it, rather it depicts a foaming bug of beer.  The corners of the book

their being bent.  Being a thin book it looks like it would not take long

chiiron~
Ah, a fine little town indeed.  Chiiron seems to be growing rapidly,
however its clientele seems to remain primarily travelers and
adventurers.  While this is good for the town, bringing in lots of
external money and trade, it has done little for its actual residential
status as anything more than a small town.
~
E
chiiron2~
The tavern in this little town is called the Fighting Ferret.  It is
owned by a retired adventurer by the name of Berdeth who spends his days
above the tavern teaching his skills to interested parties for a fee. 
The atmosphere of the Ferret is more or less relaxed.  Its busy hours
tend to vary, as the majority of its clientele are adventurers who keep
their own hours.  The fare there is simple.  Beer is sold by the bottle
or the barrel, bring your own meals.  The beer is good quality and the
proprietor doesn't water it down at all.  provided you do not come at a
time when the owner is providing lessons upstairs, the noise is limited
to your standard tavern gossip.
 
I give the Fighting Ferret a rating of two mugs.

Ah, Dark Haven.  Now there's a town of which I have many fond memories. 
A den of thieves, cutthroats and scoundrels.  Home to the most wretched
scum to walk the streets.  Where better a place to find whatever it is
you want.  If they don't already have it, there is always someone there
who will aquire it, for a price.
~
E
dark2~
For my own safety I will not reveal the location of this little hideaway,
however should you ever find yourself in Dark Haven with your throat in
tact, it would be worth the time to stop by the Black Unicorn tavern. 
The atmostphere leaves a lot to be said, but the beer there is top notch. 
Sure, you may have to drink it from a dirty mug, but why let that stop
you?  A finer beer brewed, short of a dwarven stout, can not be had
anywhere else.  Best of all, I can garauntee the beer won't be watered
down.  When I first came to the Black Unicorn, its previous proprietor
was being carted out for watering down the drinks.  The locals take their
drink very seriously.  The beer here can be bought by the bottle or the
barrel.  If you're lucky the bar may also have a good bottle or two of
whiskey in stock as well.  After your drink you can even settle down for
a nice pipe of tobacco, which can also be found on the premesis.  What
more could you want?
  
I give the Black Unicorn two and a half mugs.

the merits of ogre works, and thus to their scale and tastes.  I have
known quite a few ogres in my time, and it was only by traveling in the
relative safety of their company that I managed to make it to this city
~
E
denab2~
As it was, I had to suffer through three cracked ribs and a broken nose
for my short revelry spent in the Hanging Human, and these from my
friends.  Only an ogre could truly appreciate the decor of the Hanging
Human.  It is all built to the scale of ogres, meaning larger than any
other folk would find comforting.  Personally, I prefer a bar where my
feet touch the floor when I sit on a bench or stool.  The beer there is a
bit watered down, but if you value your life at all I wouldn't mention it
to anyone there.  For those not inclined to drink alcohol you can also
buy water there, though I'm not certain if its meant to be water or just
the beer that is so watered down that you can't tell its beer any more. 
It has a slight amber hue, which is quite unusual for water.  In the end
I decided I did not really want to know why, and I left well enough alone. 
Consistent with the scale of things, beer and water can only be bought by
the barrel here.
   
I give the Hanging Human one and a half mugs.

kha-da~
Kha-da must be one of the most stable dwellings I know.  It has neither
grown nor shrunk in size in all my years of travel out to it.  Though the
ceilings are a bit low for anyone larger than a dwarf in most places, but
learning to deal with it is well worth the time.  The dwarves of the city
are a hearty breed of folk who enjoy their beer.
~
E
kha-da2~
There is only one official pub in Kha-da, the Dragon-Slayer, run by my
good friend Mednoc.  In truth, almost every dwarf there brews their own
beer, however, they almost all agree that Mednoc brews the best in town. 
His dwarven stout beer is probably the best known beer in all the realm,
as adventurers stopping by tend to spread the word quite gleefully that
they have been to the Dragon-Slayer and that the rumors are in fact true. 
If you stop by you can buy his dwarven stout by the bottle or the barrel. 
Aside from a decidely low ceiling, the Dragon-Slayer has a wonderful
atmosphere.  Unless of course you happen to be a dragon.  The walls are
covered with the trophies of dwarven heroes' tussels with dragon.  Even
the proprietor has managed to bring in several scales and teeth from his
own travels.  If you seek an exciting tale, one involving danger and
dragons, one involving several rounds of beer during the telling, this is
the place for you.
  
I give the Dragon-Slayer three mugs.

Medienne was once the uncontested largest city in the realm, right up
until the war between the elves and humans nearly managed to burn it to
the ground.  Despite the aura of despair and death that loomed over the
city for many many years after that brutal war, it is finally making a
come back.  In the last four years if has managed to clean finally begin
the lifting of its dark aura and begin a program of civil renewel.  These
days you can even find many elves stopping by the city.
   
Medienne was once the home to six taverns, quite a feat.  Unfortunately
four of its fine establishments were casualties of that fateful war.  Two
of the taverns remain, the Rusty Nail and the Cracked Crown.
   
   
The next two sections of the book are devoted to those two taverns.  If
you wanted to learn more about the two taverns you could probably

Ah, we come at last to Pennan.  The humble home of my simple beginnings. 
In all my travels I have never found so rural or so rustic a town.  The
urban sprawl lays stretched over nearly as much land as Medienne itslef,
however its domociles are seperated by lush fields and grazing lands. 
What it lacks in so-called civilized culture, it more than makes up for
in hospitatlity.

The Cardinal is the towns local drinking spot, a rustic country inn with
all the trimmings.  As you come in the front door you will doubtless be
greeted by the sight of the bar's keeper Egrham.  Egrham runs a spotless
bar and waits on his customers with a patience and serenity rarely found. 
Beyond his pleasant demeanor, he also keeps a well stocked inn.  He has a
fine store of good home-brewed beer as well as an ample supply of fruits,
meats, and bread.  If you ever chance to stop in here I would suggest
ordering some of his roast mutton simmered in spiced potatoes and carrots. 
Its a house specialty and quite popular with locals and travellers alike. 
The Cardinal also sports a side room for those more inclined to private
conversation.  Both the bar and the side room house an ample hearth to
warm the place in the colder months.  For the travel weary there is
always a cot upstairs in the inn's common room.
  
I give the Cardinal three mugs for its fine atmosphere and food.

Sos-Kul, you could only love it if you were born there.  Marshy, wet,

who speaks any tongue other than their own.  The natives seem to like
their homes undisturbed and have little interest in the outside world. 
Those few that show any interest in learning another language tend to
leave town for more civilized parts and rarely, if ever, return home.
  
Though I have met a few lizardfolk, I can't say as I've ever seen one in
a tavern more than once.  It's not that they have no tolerance for drink,
its more that they seem to have no interest in it.  This is further
evidenced by the fact that you will not find a drinking establishment in
their bug-ridden marsh of a homeland.

Short of its native elves, few travellers ever have the distinction of

I would have missed the opportunity had I not been traveling in the
company of an elf at the time.  My most gracious host won me passage into
their hidden city long enough for me to drop in at its local tavern.
~
E
vaasa2~
The elves are an alien lot, and at best, it is difficult to understand
why they choose to do what they do.  The closest thing they have to a
tavern is something the call simply, The Glade.  It has neither walls nor
roof.  Rain or shine, wind or snow the elves seem not to care.  If they
feel the urge to gather there for a drink they simply go and appear
unconcerned as to the weather.  Fortunately for me, it was a warm, dry
day when chanced to visit.  The fare there is decidedly elven, as is the
clientele.  Meals consist of fruits or the bread-like wafers they make
called lembas.  Drinks usually constitute no more than water, however
there is an ample supply of elven wines and meads available at the
counter.  I suppose the conversation must be stimulating to elves,
however, as a visitor I was quite at a loss.  Much like any other tavern
it had its fair share of local gossip and regulars, however, lacking
walls to hang anything it lacks in decor.  It is a bit unusual sitting in
a forest glade surrounded by plants and fresh air and calling it a
tavern, however, it appears to suffice for the elves.
  
I give the Glade two mugs.

worst that can occur is you get eaten.  The only town darker than this
one may be Dark Haven, a city of traitors cast out by their own kind. 
Despite the sinister nature of the entire town, it does hold rewards for
those who know where to seek them.
~
E
voaleth2~
On my lengthy stay in this well-concealed town I spent several long
nights in its best, and only, drinking establishment.  Ingblad's Bar and
Grille comes nowhere near what I'd call a fine tavern, however it does
serve its purpose.  Food and drink can be found in abundance; both for
sale and on the walls and floor.  It is probably best if you don't
question where the meat came from.  The dim lighting is nowhere near dim
enough to conceal the fact that the mugs haven't been washed, much like
many of Ingblad's patrons.  The furniture is probably the best sort for a
place such as this.  Sturdy best describes it.  The favorite form of
entertainment at Ingblad's seems to be the common bar-room brawl, which
is a sight safer than a walk on the streets.  If you manage to survive a
few brawls there, you may even be able to strike up a conversation with
some of the local denizens.  For a price, useful information can be had
there.  Of course, the price may range from a simple bowl of mystery meat
stew (with the obligatory eye in it) to several platinum depending on how
hard it was come by.  For the frail or weak-stomached, I would advice
avoiding this place at all costs.

The Cracked Crown was the second oldest, and most popular of the drinking
establishments from Medienne.  It has managed survive a war and two
sieges relatively unscathed.  The atmosphere there is classic tavern.  A
barrel-chested man by the name of Braedwald has run the fine
establishment for many years now, after inheriting it from his father. 
His fine staff of women and men are generally pleasant and efficient at
keeping the customers happy.  It is a communal meeting place and the
source of the best gossip in town.  A magnificent hearth in the center of
the tavern provides warmth for the tired and weary year round.  The
hearth is also the source of the wonderful aromas that waft from this
establishment as you will almost always find a steak roasting on the spit. 
Braedwall's tavern serves a fine roast steak, golden-crusted chicken
potpie, and has hard cheese on hand to compliment any meal.  To wash it 
down you can order a bottle of good beer or a cup of fine ale.  For the
travel-minded outfitting for a large trek you can also purchase a barrel
of Braedwald's fine beer from his ample reserves.  Between the fine
atmosphere, the impeccable service and absolutelty divine food you may
never want to stop elsewhere again.

The Rusty Nail is the newer of the two drinking establishments in
Medienne.  Since the great war with the elves, it has been completely
rebuilt, and from what I hear, it is a much pleasanter place now.  The
lack of sufficient lighting in the building does much to improve the
atmosphere there as well as hide the fact that the glasses are not always
clean.  The clientele there rarely comes for the dinner fare so much as
for the opportunities that present themsleves there.  The unwary had best
avoid this place lest they find themselves poorer of blood and coin in
the morning, if they ever wake.  The Rusty Nail is managed by a stout
roughian by the name of Garth and he is very effective at his job.  He
doubles as both barkeep and bouncer, although, whenever someone needs
removing from the premesis all the clients are more than eager to assist. 
While there is no real food fare to speak of, a drink can always be found
here.  Garth keeps an ample supply of beer and rum, the prefered choice
of his customers.  For the rare adventurer who comes in to outfit before
a long quest, Garth has been known to sell them the water barrels he uses
to rinse his mugs in.
 
I give the Rusty nail one and a half mugs.

image~
You are suddenly overcome by the memory of glorious battles, throughout
all of which you were wielding this mace with lethal skill.  Images of
the past battles flash through your mind.
~
E
image2~
You remember clearly a battle in which you waded through hordes of humans
to strike down their leader after a titanic clash between the two of you. 
After the battle you remember seeing his blood on your, hands.  Fine,
elven hands, skilled in the art of war.
~
E
image3~
You remember with clarity the battle to preserve your town from an
invading army of ogres come to steal precious steel.  Through an act of
sheer strength and battle prowess you managed to turn back dozens of the
horde.  Afterward you remember being congratulated and toasted by your
brother, a rather vicious looking orc like yourself.
~
E
image4~
You remember countless battles in which you faced down vyan and troll
alike in an effort to avenge your fallen companions.  You can even now
remember the rage that burned in your blood as you watched them slay your
sister, unable all the while to reach her in time to save her.  You
remember the vow you took to make them rue the day they crossed paths
with you or any other dwarf.
~
E
image5~
You can vaguely remember using the mace to batter down human and elf
alike, followed by the lavish feast that follows any battle.  The gore of
their blood and flesh tasting fine on your sharp troll's teeth and
indiscriminate palate.  The thought returns that this is a good weapon
and it serves you well.
~
E
image6~
You remember an honorable duel fought between you and your cousin for the
honor of championing the family at the tournament.  You quickly bested
him with your prized mace and won the right to champion your family in
the tournament at Medienne this feast.  You remember thinking that of all
the humans their, you could fight with all the ferocity of an ogre when
you called upon the strength of your fine weapon.
~
E

Then a nagging thought tugs at a corner of your mind and you begin to
doubt.  When did this occur?  Surely not in your lifetime.  If not your
memory?  From whence does it spring?

The mace in $n's possession begins to glow with a fierce light, yet the

Burned almost beyond any recognition the scroll has managed to survive a

simple parlor trick, but can be made to appear real to those who do not
understand them.  A small example is the famous illusionary wall trick. 
One must only designate a trigger object to dispel its illusion.  Our
methods were to use 'ice crystals' as a main object.  Simply throwing
them at the illusion caused these fragile crystals to disrupt the magic,
dispelling the illusion!" The rest of the scroll is too far destroyed to

all.

search party which quickly found our dear warriors about a mile away
horribly mutilated.  Giant tracks lead away from their bodies and when
have decided to give chase and avenge our lost comrades.  I do not know
what is happening, our patrols are usually large enough to take on fifty
giants, but i believe something is amiss and trouble is brewing in the

peaceful people we have sealed our own fate by attacking the frost giants
which meant us no harm.  As i sleep at night i hear them charging at the
gates attempting to break them down.  We have lost over seventy-five
percent of our forces already and we are already starving to death.  In a
final attempt to thwart the attack we shall strike at the very heart of
the frost giants, it is our hope that this will drive them away.  If this
fails we shall seek shelter in the c.......  which are well hidden and
far too small for the giants to enter.  This may be my final entry, if
someone finds this hear my words, the giants are brutal and have shown no
mercy, if you are in the complex reading this i suggest you leave for the
giants are probably still their and will strike down any unwanted
visitors.  If you can make it to the ........

A large stone dais of silver-flecked black stone forms the base of a
large marble throne.  The throne itself is a blend of the dark stone and
pristine white marble carved into sweeping arcs and spirals.  The back is
formed into the shape of leathery wings folded about the seat to protect
its occupant.  A reptillian head glares down from above the throne nearly
managing to instill actual dragonfear.  As it is, you are left uneasy at
the sight.
~
E
head~
The draconic head above the throne glares at you with dire menace in its
thinly slit eyes.  The thin, reptilian lip is slightly pulled back
revealing sharp teeth, and as you watch you can almost feel the hot
breath that must come from the fiery depths that hold a rage so strong
only a dragon might contain it.  Countless scales, each a master work of
art, indistinguishable form the real thing form the taught skin that
surrounds the neck and head in a perfect set of armor.  Looking at the
menace this throne was modelled on, it is not hard to imagine the dread
dragonfear the real thing must inspire.

extremely well and would offer great protection in a storm.

Long, and powerful looking, the horn yet retains an appearance of grace. 
The horn is just a touch over two feet long and perhaps eight inches wide
at its base.  It appears quite like ivory, yet you can sort of see into
it as you might a tigerseye stone.  Though it is mostly off-white on the
outside, you can see definite undercurrents of amber running in streaks
through its inner layers.

This crystalline shortsword is covered from te hilt to the tip of the
blade with frost.  Intricate runes border the quillon, and it is very
cold in your hand.  The blade itself is extremely sharp, and you can only
assume this entire weapon was wrought with powerful magics; it steams
from being cold, yet the steam does not seem to deteriorate the weapon,
as it loses no mass.

Obviously the chair of a figure of some importance and refined taste,
this overstuffed, gray velvet-like chair stands at the head of the table. 
Stitched into the back, with gold thread, the banner of the Merchants
Guild flashes brightly in the firelight.  Small diamond studs hold down
the edge of the fine, gray fabric, but the fabric itself seems to shimmer
and move about unpredictably as if always about to fade into the shadows
from view.

Roughly carved from a single, large block of obsidian, this small stool
stands quietly by the wall opposite the fire.  Claw marks score both the
stool and the part of the table nearest it.  From the size of the marks,
and the ease with which one with a tail might sit in this compact, hard
seat, the nature of its occupant slowly becomes clear.

Great care has been taken that each aspect of this fine chair bespeaks
the taste of its occupant.  Over the ironwood frame, layers of crimson
silk have been stretched tight.  Sigils of a dark and malign intent have
been sewn along the sides, gleaming like elf-hair in the dark.  The arms
of the chair gleam like bone, and upon further inpection, do indeed end
in lythe, delicate skeletal hands clutched in pain.

What a strange creatures these troglodytes are.  It appears quite
humanoid in nature, though it is no larger than a gnome or a goblin.  Its
skin, though still showing signs of once being a mottled brown color, has
begun to fade to an ashen color as it rots away.  Bits of dry, sinewy
muscle are exposed where the skin has rotted away, and in some places
even dull white bones is visible.  Bits of skin writhe as grubs work
their way about beneath the surface.

$n fumbles with a festively colored cylinder, carefully setting it on the

In the process of your pulling the cord out, it snaps in the middle.  The
half of the cord attached to the clinder begins to spark and sputter,

central point in the sky.  The bright lines last for a few moments, their
glowing shape taking the form of a large purple blossom, before slowly

A loud KA-BOOM catches your attention, coming from somewhere in the sky. 
Turning to follow the direction of the sound, you notice a series of

slowly fading from view.
~

Boom3~
A loud POP followed by several shrill whistles draws your attention
skyward.  Up in the heavens you can make out several swirling balls of

color.  The balls travel in hapless pattern of chaotic frenzy until they
burn themselves out.
~
E
Boom4~
A loud KA-BOOM resounds from high above, its deeper bass sound vibrating
the ground beneath your feet.  Quickly looking upward you just catch a

brilliant explotions of light shake the ground, leaving behind a small
corona of light.

The quill measures about five inches from nib to feathery tip.  The
feather is extravagent in its beauty, not unlike a cross between an
eagle's pinion feather and the dazzle of a peacock feather.  The feathers
colors run primarily through green and purple, though there is a rim of
pink running down one edge.

A wide phial of clear crystal carefully cut to reflect light in a

it is mostly berries and oils and probably has no blood in it at all.

This simple, yet sturdy axe is made from the purest mithril you have ever

Three feet long and two feet wide, this sketch is drawn upon a scrap of
papyrus parchment.  The edges of the parchment are tattered and frayed,
though the surface of the paper still retains much durability.  Drawn
upon the surface of the papyrus is a sketch of a beautiful woman.  Or at
least you assume its a woman, judging from the artist's depiction of the
curvy body.  Yet, the head of the woman is that of a feline with but
vague humanoid features.  Whoever drew this sketch was indeed inspired
and taken with a vision.

This staff has been carved from an unusually fine piece of walnut into
the shape of a serpent and small beads of ebony have been inlaid for the
eyes.  The quality of the carving, however, is far from excellent,
probably done by an apprentice or amateur.  As you look on it, the staff
seems to move slightly, almost writhing in slow motion.  The wood is
scarred a few inches from the tip of the tail, as if it had been broken
and healed over.

Aparently this is a long lost blade of dwarven history, one of the few
swords to make it into their lore.  Within is trapped the soul of a
dwarven warrior, having accidently bound himself to the blade until such
time as a certain family line of red dragons was utterly destroyed.

blood~
Having tasted the hot blood of the wyrm that has so long been its
adversary, the sword you wield seems its moment of triumph and salvation
at long last.  Nearly wrenching itself from your grasp it forces you to
lunge inward, perilously close to razor sharp talons and a steaming maw
of teeth like an armory of swords.  With a precision and ferocity beyond
your capability it drives you to place five perfect blows severing all
connections between the great wyrm and its heart.  You narrowly avoid
being crushed several times in the seconds of thrashing that ensue after
the amazing exchange of blows.  when it is over, the beast is no more
than a corpse on the ground.
~
E
bye_shield~
Sensing the passing of the ancient wyrm, the magic that linked the shield
to its powers begins to consume it.  Before long it has grown so hot you
are forced to drop it or become seriously burned by the heat it is now
building up.  Not long after that it is no more than a pile of slag
cooling on the ground.
~
E
rblood~
With a speed and ferocity you have never seen the likes of, $n moves like
a blur in and under the great wyrm to place five blows with lethal
accuracy.  Looking somewhat dazed, $e narrowly avoids being crushed as $e
ducks and rolls out from under the now wildly thrashing body of the
ancient beast.  In a matter of moments the agonizing death throes end and
the corpse is still.
~
E
rbye_shield~
Still looking somewhat dazed by $s encounter with the ancient red dragon,
$n suddenly becomes quite animate as $e throws down $s now glowing shield.

The runes on the blade are an archaic form of dwarven rarely seen these

history~
Recalling a bit of old dwarven lore you remember a tale about a dwarven
warrior by the name of of Duenghar.  The legend speaks of the slaughter
of nearly her entire clan by a single red dragon and her vow to stand
against the dragon's family line until it was entirely destroyed.  To the
dwarves it is a tale of honor, courage and the eventual rewards of hard
work and persistence.

This sleek, slender sabre is made from a violet-hued metal which has
splashes of deep purple within it.  As light hits the blade it changes
colors and sends a ray of violet light across the ground.  Its handle is
covered in a thick leather wrapped and its guard is made from some type
of bone.

A large red sapphire hangs from the end of a gold chain, forming this
very beautiful pendant.  Looking closely you notice the sapphire has not
been cut or altered from its original shape and no flaws can be seen
within it.  The sapphire has amazingly been formed into the shape of a
teardrop which gleams when light hits it.

This strip of cloth is about two inches wide and four feet long.  The
weave of the material is such that you can see through the strip without
too much difficulty.  Though the strip of gauze looks to be meant to be
worn about the eyes, it could probably be useful as a bandage or even as
a face mask too.

Carved from a piece of grey granite, this section of stone has a curved
shape to it.  Along the interior of the partial stone circlet, there are
deep etchings which at one time might have been runes or glyphs but are
now too worn to read.  Both ends of the circlet appear to be deliberately
dovetailed, as though waiting to be joined with something else.

This nut is brown in color with streaks of black trailing across its hull. 
Oval in shape, the pecan is about the size of a large pebble.  The shell
of the pecan is fairly thin.  It probably would not take much to crack it

Unseemly though it sounds, the insides of the pecan resemble a squirrel's
brain more than anything else.  The tender pecan meat is roughly the same
size, shape, and even has the same, wrinkled texture.  The only
differences between the two are that the pecan meat is a light brown
color and smells much more aromatic, or at least you hope so.

The petals of this flower are irregularly shaped and vary between ovals
and tear drops.  For the most part, the orchid's petals are a velvety
black and its leaves are the color of a mature praying mantis.
~
E
after~
Though its petals are each shaped a bit differently, overall, they have
an oval or tear drop shape.  At the very center of the orchid, the base
of each petal is a dark, blood-red color.  The red then bleeds into a
dark green which darkens into a velvety black color.  All in all, the
orchid's petals give you the impression of a serpent's mouth.  A thick,
viscous material clings to the pistils of the orchid.

Regardless of color, most clovers have three heart- shaped leaves and a
short stem.  A clover having four leaves is so rare that oft they are
thought to be lucky and perhaps even magical.  This red clover is not
unlike other clovers, except that it has five leaves, not just three or
even four.  The leaves have thin green veins running through them which
collect at the clover's base in a blood-red stem.  Just how lucky or
magical could it be?

Several jagged, vein-like cracks run down through the center of this
relatively flat stone.  The edges of the stone are broken and crumbling. 
Though pitted and scarred on one side, the stone is completely smooth,
almost polished, on the other side.  A series of crude symbols have been
etched into the smooth side of the broken stone.
~
E

This red chunk of flat stone is about a foot wide and two feet long.  Two
edges and one side of the stone are nice and smooth while the others are
rough and crumbly, as if broken away from something much larger.  The
front surface of the stone is covered with a series of hieroglyphics.
~
E

Adorned with a series of hieroglyphics, the heavy slab of stone looks to
be part of a much larger piece.  In fact, on the front of the stone, on
the polished side, there are numerous hieroglyphics.  The hieroglyphics
stream across the jagged edges of the stone, as if there was once more to
the hieroglyphic tale.  In fact, this piece of stone appears to be the
lower right portion of a much larger stone tablet.

The origins of this bone are somewhat nebulous.  Its size and shape
relates it to a humanoid fingerbone, but of what specific race of bipeds
that have gripping hands, you are uncertain.  In a couple of places, the
finger bone bears gnaws marks which graze just the surface of the
skeletal fragment.
~
E
after~
Unless you are mistaken, this appears to be the pinkie finger bone of a
human.  It is thick but short and the knuckle bones are characteristic of
the human physiognomy.  Up and down the finger bone there are scrapings,
as though something had been gnawing on the finger previously.

Crafted from fine rosewood and stained oak, the colors of this musical
instrument match its exquisite craftsmanship.  Ten strings run the length
from sound chamber to the end of a neck intricately carved to look like
scrolling leaves.  The keys for tuning the string are a fine mix of
silver with just a bit of mithril in the casting to give them strength.
@CSeveral of the strings are broken@n, and it looks unsuitable for
playing until it gets fixed.

Sure, it would probably sound real nice to play the mandolin, but how are

Perhaps you should get it fixed first.

A spiked ball of gleaming metal rests at the end of a long chain of

This mineral can be nothing other than quartz for it is too hard to be
glass and not refractive enough to be diamond.  Clear as a cloudless day,
this chunk of quartz is cylindrical in shape and has a hexagonal
structure.  One end of the quartz is slightly fractured, where it was no

Several jagged, vein-like cracks run down through the center of this
relatively flat stone.  The edges of the stone are broken and crumbling. 
Though pitted and scarred on one side, the stone is completely smooth,
almost polished, on the other side.  A series of crude symbols have been
etched into the smooth side of the broken stone.
~
E
after~
Vaguely rectangular in shape, this slab of stone is two inches thick and 
is the epitome of contradiction.  While one side of the stone is jagged
and plain, the other is smooth and covered with symbols.  Two of the
slab's edges are broken and crumbling and while the adjacent edges have
been carefully and evenly polished.  from the obvious breakage points,
its probable that this piece of stone use to be part of a sizably larger
stone.
~
E
symbols~
The symbols adorning the face of the stone are like none you have ever
seen and yet, some of them look particularly familiar.  In fact, the
symbols toward the bottom of the stone, just at one of the breakage
points, appears oddly reminiscent of primitive human scrawlings.

The origins of this bone are somewhat nebulous.  Its size and shape
relates it to a humanoid fingerbone, but of what specific race of bipeds
that have gripping hands, you are uncertain.  In a couple of places, the
finger bone bears gnaws marks which graze just the surface of the
skeletal fragment.
~
E
after~
From what remains of this bone, it resembles a lizardman's index claw
more than a finger.  Though each tapers in the same manner, on a
lizardman's claw gets wider at the tip rather than slimmer.  Judging from
the stress and breakage along the third knuckle, at the base of the claw,
it was apparently torn off rather than cleanly severed.

You see before you the long, relatively straight bole of a fallen oak. 
The remains of the root system at one end are thickly clotted with
decomposing bits and dirt.  Along the length the bark has begun to
crumble away in several places, though it still remains sturdy enough to
provide a decent place for several people to sit.  At the far end from
the roots only short, barbed stumps remain where the once proud crown of
branches must have reached outward magnificently.

This lump of flesh has been dead (removed from its host) for many days. 
Maggots swarm in and out of the decaying mass of flesh, gorging
themselves.  It is impossible to pinpoint what type of creature this is
part of.  A putrid smell surrounds the chunk of flesh, endangering even
the stoutest of stomachs to lose its contents.

This osteary fragment is indeterminable in both origin and function. 
Really no more than a splinter of bone, the bleached white fragment is
about three inches long and blunt on both of its ends.  One side of the

This square of hide comes from a large, bipedal serpentine.  You can tell
this by the unusually flexible yet durable scales which cling to the
exterior of the leathery hide.  The scales vary in size and color, but

Ten or twelve feathers lie in a clump, looking freshly plucked from an
unlucky condor.  For the most part, the feathers are a medium grey color
and no longer than six inches.  The tips of a few of the feathers are
black and white.  These differently colored feathers tend to be much
larger and longer, leading you to believe they were either the tail or
flight feathers of the unfortunate bird.

This thin, papery skin is smooth and oily on one side and rough and
tattered on the other.  It is covered with tiny scales that look both
supple and durable.  White markings trail over the surface of the viper
skin, in stark contrast to the tan-colored scales.  A layer of viscous
material lightly covers the exterior of the skin, so you better not

This extremely large hide looks to have belonged to an animal that was a
cross between a dog and a sheep.  Though the dark fur still attached to
the skin is straight and long, it is very coarse and long.  In places on
the hide, the wool-like fur is matted.  In others, patches of fur are
missing entirely.  The underside of the hide is extremely aromatic.

At first glance, this three foot horn looks to be made of a three layers
of inlaid jewels and minerals.  The horn spirals around, like twisted
strands of thread, from its wide base to its needle-sharp point.  The
very tip of the horn is the color of the sea and looks nothing more like
inlaid lapis lazuli.  The middle of the spiraling design is white and
looks of ivory.  The broadest part of the alicorn, the base, seems as
though it is carved from the blackest and darkest on onyx stones.  A
noticeable aura of goodness, life and magic exudes from the spiraling
horn.

Each horseshoe has been polished to a perfect sheen and has precise nail

interior, these have been fashioned to have more of a star-shaped inside. 
Along the inner rim of each silvery masterpiece are tiny, mystical runes.

This small, platelike epidermal structure is about four inches across and
has the shape of an ash leaf, roughly.  The edges of the scale are thin
and the interior of the scale is bubbled outward, so that it is fairly

surface of the fur, giving it a blended texture.  This skin is but a
section of some large, dog-like creature's pelt.

Very similar to a lobster's claw, but bigger, this appendage is composed
of two section.  The upper portion of the claw is hooked like a mountain
crow's beak while the lower section is recessed and serrated.  The red
chitin forming the exoskeletal plates forming the claw are extremely
dense and sturdy.

A few strings of leathery flesh cling to the sides of this oval, internal
organ.  Roughly the size of an apple, this vesicle seemed to have once
served the purpose of retaining some fluid or another.  Surrounding the
mouth of the liquid vessel there is a thick, viscous residue of some type
of resin.

This dark grey nail is about two inches long and very sharp at one end. 
The nail's weight is almost negligable, for it is mostly hollow.  All

Unlike most horseshoes which are forged from crude iron, these four
horseshoes have been expertly crafted from pure gold.  And not just
ordinary gold.  The gold used to forge these treasures is a deep red
color, which, if legend is true, could only be the gold found in a
leprechaun's hoard.  Hammered into precisely the same shape, each
horseshoe has the pattern of a starburst forged into their interior,
setting aside the traditional U-shape.  Glyphs too tiny to read decorate
the inner rim of each shoe.
~
E
before~
Forged from gold and beaten into shape, you would think that these
horseshoes would be too soft and impractical for use.  Nonetheless, these
seem quite durable.  They also radiate a small amount of warmth.

These transparent wings are shaped much like those of a butterflies, but
a bit larger.  Fine, colorful veins float across the surface of the

This thin, light weight structure is blue in color and ends with a fluffy

Never in your life have you seen such a valuable skin.  Though the skin
is that of a medium-sized dog, the fur still attached to the hide of the

This set of snake fangs looks to have been ripped out of a some serpent
or snake with the jaw intact.  The upper two fangs set into the skeletal
jaw are about an inch and a half in length while the lower two fangs jut
inward at a slight angle and are little more than an inch long.  One
notable characteristic about the fangs, though, are that they are hollow. 
In fact, the interior of the two upper fangs still appears to hold some
viscous liquid.

Sitting on the ground, minding its own business, is a very old looking
sandstone rock.  Its surface is pitted with the assault of both abrasive
desert winds and the occasional rending gash by what is probably some
desert reptile.  Though large enough to sit upon, its rough, craggy
surface is fairly bumpy, which would make the experience unpleasant at
the very least.  The bottom of the sandstone rock is beveled, as if by
something other than nature.

A little mechanical construct a mere eight inches tall.  Its wooden face
has the bulbous eyes and warty protrusions common to most goblinoids. 
Someone has painted the wooden head and body green and the eyes a bright
yellow.  Though the jointed arms and legs show signs of being able to
move, they are rigidly stiff right now.  A little key is affixed to to
the thing's back.  The key is slowly rotating as it totters about.

totter~
The clockwork goblin totters about the room stiffly on its mechanical
legs.  Every time it leans too far in one direction, it somehow manages to
correct itself and takes another step.
~
E
boom~
A culmination of whirs and clicks reaches a fevered pace and suddenly the
poor little clockwork goblin explodes in a profusion of sharp bits and
gears and pieces.
~
E
thud~
Finally, running out of energy, the clicks and whirs of its internal
mechanisms come to a stop and the clockwork goblin topples over onto its
side.
~
E
totter2~
The little goblin takes its first few steps slowly and jerkily, as if
putting into use gears that have long remained unused.  Then it quickly
picks up speed to the accompaniment of a series of clicks and whirs
occuring from within the toy.
~
E
totter3~
The clicks and whirs continue as the mechanical goblin rapidly totters
about the room in random arcs and circles.  Somehow it manages to avoid
bumping into things or walking off edges just in the nick of time
whenever it comes too close to one.

A toy bird constructed of some light wood.  It's hard to tell for
certain, but it feels like it could be balsa with some kind of hardened
shellac coating.  Under the clear protective coat the bird is a vivid
yellow with touches of green and black for highlighting.  Little black
beads are set into the head for almost life-like eyes.  The wings are
currently folded back, though retain the same slightly rounded arc they
would if used in flight.  A small, metal square peg is recessed inside a
hole in the bird's back.  If you had a key to wind it, perhaps the bird

This thin but heavy crystal is shaped like the hexagonal spire of some
castle or keep.  One end of the crystalline rod is a bit more pointed

something more, for inside, its crystalline lattice seems to hum.

A little bit larger than a single ice crystal, this white grain of sand
is a bit unusual.  Not only is its size odd, but it also feels remarkably
cooler than it ought.  Light plays off the tiny white grain of said in an
unusual manner, as though it were being reflected.

A few grains of sand, perhaps eight or ten, have been gathered together
in a small pinch.  The large, tan granules of desert soil are rough and
gritty and are reminiscent of something a farmer might apply to his
fields as fertilizer.  The pinch of tan sand is stickier than you might
expect, and seems to clump together well.

A few grains of white sand, perhaps eight or ten, have been gathered
together in a small pinch.  The large, snowy granules of desert soil are
rough and gritty and remind you distinctly of individual ice crystals. 
The pinch of white sand is cooler than you might expect, and seems to be
reflecting a great proportion of the light hitting it.

A small amount of sand, barely more than eight or nine pinches of the tan
grains of desert soil, has been gathered into a handful.  The tan sand is

A small amount of neon-blue sand, barely more than eight or nine pinches
of azure desert soil, has been gathered into a handful.  The blue sand is
soft and smooth, not gritty.  In fact, the sand feels more like dust than
anything else.  Even though the texture of the sand matches that of dust,
it is much heavier than you might normally expect of something so powdery
and is slightly cool.

A five inch tall cylindrical drum is attached to a medium-sized wooden
half.  The end of the odd-looking club, which is made of iron, has
shallow grooves running lengthwise down its head.  Carved into the wooden
handle of the knobkerrie, are several scenes of frolicing woodland
creatures.  Among them are nymphs, ents, daryds and sprites, and swarming
around a ring of stones.  Dents in the iron drumhead of the curving club

A handful of the little fruit morsels.  Each raspberry consists of at
least a score of bright @rred@n berries in a tight cluster.  When chewed, the
little seeds add a slight crunch to the sweet juices contained in the
soft pulp of the berries.  These look ripe and absolutely ready to eat.

Made from the rattle of a snake and blessed by the dark gods, this charm

The grip is made of burnished oak that is warm to the touch as if it has

a bit of a mystery, perhaps it was magic.  A pattern of lilies has been

Clearly designed for a small animal, probably a cat, this collar is
absolutely beautiful.  It is made of a flexible band of silver with
silver spikes separated by dazzling citrine, topaz, and amethyst gems. 
From the collar dangles a small tag with the word "Slip" engraved upon it.

The Great Theft

I was younger then.  Not just in years, but in my mind.  Decades of
suffering and horror has wrinkled my face and made my eyes leery of the
tiniest shadow.  I was a carefree man before my hands were coated in the
ichor of a thousand unnatural creatures.

Our land is filled with the darkest fears of mankind given life.  Undead
shamble through abandoned chapels and feed their impossible cravings with
the souls of those foolish enough to walk the dark paths.  Nightmares
come to life and fill men with insanity, urging them to turn on their
brothers.  Renegade raiders rage in secret camps and plot to overthrow
the bastions of civilization.  We call these creatures the darkspawn, and
they were born in Gaeas darkest moment - the Theft.  Desperate
individuals, such as myself, fight this tidal wave of evil, but our
numbers shrink with each passing day.

@eIn the second journal entry, you read:@n

Those settlements that have survived the invasion have done so at great
cost.  All towns have walls - whether they are formed from mystical
wards, sharpened palisades, or honest stone.  Most of the adults in these
places bear arms in the defense of their homes while the rest eke out a
living providing food and other goods.

It wasn't just the settlements of our world that built walls.  The people
that live here have formed their own private barriers as well.  Most folk
in this region are renowned for their warmth and hospitality, but the
fiends that prey on their kindness are gradually wearing down their
compassion.  Whole nations have turned on their neighbors out of fear and
ignorance.  Wives' tales aren't used to frighten children anymore -
stories told once too often tend to come true.  Fears of the people
create the creatures of the dark.

@eIn the third journal entry, you read:@n

What the Theft is or why it occurred is a mystery.  Those who search too
hard for the truth often fall prey to its countless minions.  The people
know only that one day the world turned foul.  Our most powerful mages
cannot tell us the origins of this, and our prophets and seers vanished
that day.

It is a time of despair, of violence, and of dark sorcery.  But it is
also a time for courage and compassion.  These are the virtues that will
protect us in this dismal age.

four 4~
@eIn the fourth journal entry, you read:@n

My name is Jacob.  I am a warrior and a protector.  This journal that you
now read is my best account of the state of our world.  I have traveled
this region for many years now, fighting the Darkspawn and trying to give
hope to those who have lost theirs.  But I am not foolish enough to
believe that I am immortal.  Someday a darkspawn will gnaw my bones.  My
only wish is that another will find this work and use the knowledge
within to carry on my calling.  Let me warn you, that it is a difficult
path I tread.  You will find it filled with heartache and misery.

Before the Theft, I was part of an order dedicated to protection the
region know as the Forests Edge.  It was our task to patrol the land and
bring compassion and justice wherever we found strife.  Our members
prefered to protect instead of harm, though we were certainly capable of
the latter in times of need.  It is perhaps prophetic that the Theft is
the antithesis of these ideals.

five 5~
@eIn the fifth journal entry, you read:@n

I was a squire then, and our band rode from the Inner See to the Cairn
Mountains helping those in need.  I must begin this with that horrible
day when darkness fell.

Our band was in Medienne, a beautiful town on the eastern coast of the
Inner Sea.  It was a brilliant, sunny day, and those of us with the
talent were seeing to the ills and problems of the inhabitants of that
city.  I was spending my time conversing with the members of the local
militia, exchanging jibes and stories to pass the time, and helping out
with various physical tasks, since I have no gift for healing.
~
E
six 6~
@eIn the sixth journal entry, you read:@n

After a few hours of this work, we encountered the Blind Seer of Medienne. 
He was a local storyteller and something of a con man, I suspect, but
most days the children who gathered about him were smiling and laughing
at the old man's tales, even without coins to fill his cup.  That day,
however, the Blind Seer sat against a bleak stone wall with his head in
his hands.  One of our healers approached him, and I'll never forget the
conversation that passed between them.

'It has returned," the Seer said. 

My companion placed his hand upon the man's shoulder and comforted him,
"What?" he asked.  "what has returned?" 

He whispered. "Night has fallen. We are doomed."
~
E
seven 7~
@eIn the seventh journal entry, you read:@n

I presumed the Blind Seer mad, but my friend sank to his knees in despair. 
Then, while the two of them knelt there in their misery, a great black
cloud settled over the sun.  Only a few scant rays found their way to the
earth, enough light to give our fears shape and form.  I stared up at the
cloud, as did the Seer,though he was blind as a stone. 

Suddenly, from all about me I heard screams.  From the shadows came
creatures we had only imagined in our darkest dreams.  Things rarely seen
in this land chased people into dark alleys and devoured them in
relentless fury.  From the cemeteries arose the dead, their flesh and
bones ruined from years beneath the earth, yet now stalking among us like
deranged shepherds turned on their flock.  Demonlings, monsters,
nightmares, and ghosts - all these horrors emerged from the dark corners
of the world that night.  We would later dub them darkspawn, for they
things came out to hunt when that first darkness fell.  I fought with all
my might against the swarm of horrors that engulfed us, but in the end,
there were simply too many.
~
E
eight 8~
@eIn the eighth journal entry, you read:@n

Some time later, I found myself in the company of a ragged group of
survivors.  One of them had dragged my battered body into a stone
basement.  We lived there like frightened mice for days while my strength
slowly returned.  I cursed my luck for a time, wishing that I had fallen
with my comrades instead of surviving to die a coward's death.  But the
men and women who had saved my life still carried a gleam of hope in
their eyes, and it was this that eventually rekindled my own courage. 
The events of that week are disturbing to me even now, but suffice it to
say, we eventually escaped our prison and joined up with others in order
to reclaim the city, such as it was.

nine 9~
@eIn the ninth journal entry, you read:@n

@YDarkspawn@n

When the sun momentarily darkened, thousands of creatures only rumored to
exist in dreams and folk-tales came to life.  The darkspawn now hunt our
folk by day as well as night despite their name, so do not believe you
are safe simply because the sun is in the sky.  Darkspawn come in all
shapes and sizes.  Their only common trait is their evil souls.  I will
describe many of these fiends in other portions of this journal, but even
this roll-call is a sampling of the thousands of monstrous abominations
that walk, crawl, slither, or fly over our land.
~
E
ten 10~
@eIn the tenth journal entry, you read:@n

Some darkspawn are intelligent, scheming creatures who instigate and
organize their less clever fellows into renegade warbands.  Others hide
in the settlements and strike at us in silence.  Still others are
phantoms made of ghostly ether or even living energy.  A few are truly
bizarre, such as a living piece of stone or a patch of sentient plant
life.  It seems the Theft is capable of spawning most any nightmare it
can dredge from the psyche of our people.

It is a black stain upon Gaea's history that some sentient beings have
turned upon their fellows and submitted themselves to serve the Theft.  I
call these treacherous souls the Corrupted.
~
E
eleven 11~
@eIn the eleventh journal entry, you read:@n

The vast majority of corrupted individuals have yet to prove their worth
to the Theft.  They spend most of their time performing heinous deeds to
garner their unknown master's attention, hoping they will one day be
rewarded with fantastic power for their service.  The few corrupted that
have proven themselves worthy of whatever test the Theft requires of them
and are granted incredible powers.  These select few then become
darkspawn, or more accurately, corrupted darkspawn.  After the
transformation, there is rarely any true difference between the two. 

From that point on, their bodies and minds become even more twisted than
they might have been before, and everything they touch is corrupted to
help spread the evil of the Theft.  Because they were once one of us,
they know our weaknesses and the best way to exploit them to our own ends.

@eIn the twelvth journal entry, you read:@n

The Theft is a malignant disease eating away at the very soul of our
world.  Only the tenacious spirits of our people have thus far held the
infection in check.  But each day, some new symptom of this plague
threatens to eliminate hope and overwhelm the last bastions of
civilization.
~
E
thirteen 13~
@eIn the thirteenth journal entry, you read:@n

I have never encountered a darkspawn that knew anything of the Theft or
their origins.  I have been misled by lies, and more than a few creatures
betrayed their own beliefs before I was finished with them, but none of
these tales has been borne out.  It truly seems that even the grotesque
children of the Theft are ignorant of their own creation. 

We cannot force bastions of light into the darkness of the Dragonspires,
nor can we reclaim the beautiful city of Denae from the depths of the
Darken Wood.  But defeating a single zombie near the walls of your home
can be just as important.  These acts provide the tales that inspire the
people and give them the strength to carry on.  And every now and then,
such a deed will mark the beginning of a new champion, a new hero or
heroine.

This beautiful dagger sparkles from its jewel-encrusted hilt and pommel. 
Rich leather pads the grip.  Its blade is pure yellow, like gold, but it
shines differently than gold, and in different light it changes from
bright, white yellow to a dark orange-red.  It is wonderfully light and
extremely, extremely sharp, as you hold up a bloody finger from the mere

This beautiful plumed visor feels strange in your grip.  There is a

These white clerical robes are very comfortable-looking, and are smooth
like silk, although they are made from a different material.  A white
cowl rests comfortably on the back, more for show than of any purpose. 
The robes are a little heavy, but the fibers are strong, and there is an
inner glow from the robes, although you cannot actually see it exactly.

Most of the diary discusses prayer and meditation, and the thoughts of
the author about life: 


@Y@I@I@IAs I lay meditating, many thoughts came to me. The world is
@I@I@Iso vast, and I find that as far as I look, there is something out of 
@I@I@Isight. I often wonder, if it is so hard to see something far away, and I 
@I@I@Imust assume that the sun is quite far from here, its radiance must be
@I@I@Ifirey as well. Since the sun is circular, I must wonder also how
@I@I@Iwe look to the sun. Are we also a ball?

It continues about prayer and nonsense.  You decide to skip to the end,
eager to see what happened at the end of his life...


@Y@I@I@I"I am hungry and tired. I must pray and hope for the best. After much 
@I@I@Iarguing, my peers have retired to their rooms, and have not left them,
@I@I@Inot wanting to speak for fear of death. I do not fear death but
@I@I@II often sit here wondering what lays for me. I feel my time on
@I@I@Ithis world slowly ending. I mourn for my King. He was so loving. And now!
@I@I@IAlas! I hear his accursed form roaring underneath my chambers. I wonder
@I@I@Iwhether he shall ever be saved. I pray for him. I suppose I should put
@I@I@Ithis diary down now. I am exhausted, and must use my remaining strength
@I@I@IIn figuring out a way to save us all. - Joolan"

As you take the silvery sword in your hands, a myriad of bright images
assaults your vision.
~
E
first~
Mounted on a blood-bay gelding, you try to force your way into a mob of
riders, howling with laughter, utterly berserk, as you swing and parry
with a blood-running sword.  The man inside the mob can barely lift his
weapon; he turns desperately in his saddle.  Slashing and hacking, you
cut your way to the man's side, just in time to catch him as he falls,
his glazed eyes staring into yours...
~
E
second~
"Coward!"  You scream furiously at the man's retreating back.  Rage steals
your voice and you begin to give chase.  Hitting hard, slashing, barely
remembering to parry, you lunge for the man in your way.  It is a battle
of nerves which you win.  He falls back and you make haste after the
retreating base-born coward.
@IYounger, and faster, than your enemy, you quickly catch him up and as he
turns to fight, you see the terror in his eyes.  A lovelier sight, you've

@IArrows sing out from the walls, then again, and again.  The lead horses
rear, screaming in agony, then go down hard, rolling on their sides as
arrows come incessantly.  Horses behind them buck and kick; men yell and
swear.  The arrows fly again, a noiseless rain of death.  You spur your
mount forward, screaming out for the glory of Ri'lahl.  Brandishing your
sword, a red haze descends across your vision.  Utterly berserk, a choking
laugh bubbles from your throat as an arrow pierces your chest.  You look
down and can see the feathered shaft protruding from your rib cage.  You
laugh at the absurdity of it all, then call Ri'lahl's war cry again as you
fall from the saddle.

An ancient, leather-bound tome.  The writing on the cover of the tome, as
well as within the pages, is completely indecipherable to you; in fact
the words themselves seem to physically move about on the page, making
them not only illegible, but giving you a headache in the process.
~
E
after~
An ancient, leather-bound tome, the title of which appears to be 'A
Treatise on the Use of Mystic Circles'.  On the pages of the tome are
many long, very dry dissertations on the theories behind mystic circles,
pentagrams, and magick triangles.  The only truly interesting entry
details a teleportation ritual requiring a permanent mystic circle,
flint, nightshade, and a simple bronze cup.

The origins of this bone are somewhat nebulous.  Its size and shape
relates it to a humanoid fingerbone, but of what specific race of bipeds

A life-size replica of a cute little sprite, it stands an entire three
inches tall.  A cherubic little faces holds two merrily twinkling eyes of
vibrant green.  An oversized, belted tunic made from soft leaves and thin
garlands serves as its only clothes over its smooth skin.  Each little
hand and foot has four perfectly crafted little fingers and toes,
respectively.  The rapid twinkle of flashing glitter is all you can see
from where the rapidly fluttering wings on its back are creating a gentle
hum.  An ornate little golden key with filigree tracework is slowly
unwinding between the nearly unseen wings.

totter2~
The translucent wings on the little sprite begin to flap faster and
faster until all that is visible is a twinkling flash of glitter and a
gentle humming sound.  After a few tottering steps forward, the
mechanical sprite leaps into the air.  Just as the sprite begins to
plummet out of its leap the hum of its wings rises an octive and it arcs
smoothly upward in flight.
~
E
totter~
The clockwork sprite zips about the room in spirals of various width,
occassionally arcing and diving to some unknown agenda of its own.  Every
time it comes to near to hitting an object it speedily alters course to
zip around it two or three times before heading off towards some other
appearantly immenent disaster.
~
E
boom~
The hum of the poor toy's wings rises yet another octive to a nearly
painful whine as the mechanisms inside overwork themselves.  Suddenly the
little sprite zips straight upward, once free of objects it explodes in a
flash of light and all that remains is the glittering sparkle of little
metal bits twinkling magically back to earth.
~
E
thud~
Finally, running out of energy, the hum of the sprites wing's lowers an
octive as it gently lands on its two perfectly crafted feet.  After a few
decelerating steps the clockwork sprite comes to a complete stop, frozen
once again on its feet.
~
E
totter3~
The gentle hum continues as the clockwork toy zips about the room,
performing spectacular sprials and awesome arcs.  Somehow it continues to
avoid bumping headlong into any obstacles, instead using them as
grounding points for its dizzying display.

A thick tome covered in shimmering white leather.  Two wreaths of ivy
twined into the symbol of eternity are embossed in gold on the cover.  By
the crease in the spine you can tell it would be quite easy to turn the
cover back and @blook@n at the @bintroduction@n.
~
E
introduction~
Well, here it is.  I was asked to perform a few weddings, and finally I
got it through my thick head that maybe there was a need for this.  The
intent is to provide a nice little ceremony for each race type offered to
players as they consistently ask us immortals to perform weddings for
them.

If they are clanned, you should first try to get their clan leader to
come up with and perform a ceremony (or have him/her find a priest or
someone to perform it instead).  This reinforces the idea that clans
serve a purpose, else why did they join?

As for this tome, it will be divided into two sections for each race.  A
section for set-up and a section for the "traditional" ceremony of the
race type.  They are labeled race-eq and race-cer respectively.  For
example @blook vyan-eq@n and @blook vyan-cer@n should show you the
requisite items needed to perform a vyan ceremony followed by the
traditional ceremony itself.

If you look for something and don't find it, it means I haven't done a
ceremony for them.  If you really feel intimidated by the prospect of
creating one mail me and I'll try and come up with one asap.
Now, go look at @blook format@n to see how ceremonies are written up.
~
E
format~
A note on performing ceremonies and their contained format.

-For the sake of consistent format I've used my own name throughout,
 you'll have to replace it with your own.

-Each fragment was aliased (rather than run as code) so I could control
 it in case the bride or groom lost link or some interruption occurs.
 I advise you do the same.

-Each fragment is divided by a space.  Some have to be broken in the
 alias with an '&' since not everyone has worwrap.  Play with it till
 it works right and looks good.
 Meaning, colors aside, what you see under look vyan-cer  is essentially
 what everyone in the room during the vyan wedding saw.

-Almost all of it is run with emotes, rechos, and says.
  @cemotes are in cyan@n, @yrechos are in yellow@n, and
  @gsays are in green@n to help figure out which are which
  for the ceremony.  Exceptions are in parens ().  If you can't
  see colors, you can still figure it out with some work.
~
E
vyan-eq~
Have them do some quest to prove their devotion to each other.  They (and
you) should read the information at Tiercen's library (room 20073) under
the acode to look at traditions.  Gives info on Vyans weddings from the
male and female perspective.

You'll need to turn yourself into a Vyan with a good vyan desc as the
vyans consider themselves the only true People.  Others are no more than
beasts.  Like-wise, this ceremony should only be used if both bride and
groom are vyans, otherwise I'd refuse to do it.

Items you'll need to make:
          a dark altar (make it a table)
          two ceremonial braziers
          the ceremonial knife for the Sister-Guardian
               (to be placed on altar before start)
~

@ythe ceremony with a quiet prayer to the vyan pantheon.@n

@gHoly goddess of the dark visit upon this ceremony your blessings and
@gpower.@n

@yTalis passes a hand over a brazier to the right of the altar as he speaks.

@gCompanions, we have gathered here to witness the binding of two
@gfamilies in the union of these two People.@n

@cTalis lowers his voice and speaks to those directly before him now.@n

@gWhat lady of the People comes before me to bind another house to hers
@gby the taking of a husband?  Speak your name if you would have it so.@n

@gher and protect her honor in times of trouble and danger?  Come forth

@gCome forth Sister-Guardian and take the knife that symbolizes your
@gsacred duty to <insert-bride>.@n

(await the Sister-Guardian taking the dagger from the altar)

@gThe station of the Sister-Guardian is an ancient and sacred one.  For
@gno couple can forsee all that will befall them even if they be true of
@ghand, heart, and head.@n

@gIt will be your task to watch over their honor where they can not.  It
@gwill be your task to watch for dangers where they can not.@n

@gAnd, if it should come to it, you must sever the bond if <bride> is
@gunable.  If you would do these things so pledge your word to <bride>
@gthen step back.@n

(await the Sister-Guardian's pledge and emote that she steps back)

@gWhat sire of the People comes before me to bind his house to another's
@gby the taking of a wife?  Speak your name if you would have it so.@n

(await groom to speak his name)

@g<bride> and <groom>, you come before me ready to make a pldge to each
@gother for all you rlives, in honor and joy, in sorrow and strife, in
@gall things that you will endure.@n

@gThis is a time of great happiness for all the People.  For the binding
@gof a couple and their families serves to strengthen the whole of the
@gPeople as well as your faith in each other.@n

@gIf you are prepared to accept each other for all time, as is the
@gallotted span of time for the true People, in the light of your people
@gand your pantheon, so speak you both now.@n

(await bride's and groom's assent)

@Then kneel before me clasping your hands to each others' that you may
@greceive the divine blessings that will intertwine your lives as one for
@gall time.@n

(await their emotes of kneeling and such)

@cTalis lifts a ribbon of silk as ebon as the darkness from the altar and
@cwraps it loosely about <bride>'s and <grooms>'s bound hands.

@cTalis places his left hand over the dark ribbon binding the couples'
@chands.@n

@gThe silk that binds your hands symbolizes the pledge that now binds
@gyou both.@n

@g<groom>, know you this.  The silk that binds you can be as easily cut
@gshort by a blade as your life coul dbe by your wife or her
@gSister-Guardian should you give her reason.@n

@gSo love her dearly and give her your heart freely that there will never
@gbe call to ask for more than you have given.@n

@g<bride>, know you this.  The silk that binds you contains bound

@gBe sure of the true value of what is in your hand before you ever
@gchoose to cast it away.@n

@gBe always aware waht is in your heart before you make demands of

@cTalis raises a hand to the brow of each of the supplicants.@n

@gReceive now the blessings upon your life together and find all that

Unearthly power resonates from this dagger made of a darkly silver metal. 
Wicked serrated edges make the wielding of this piece impossible, except
for ritual use.  A hilt of ebon obsidian is set with several dark gems,
so dark a red they seem almost black in hue.  A finely wrought belt of
black leather, fitted with a buckle and sheath of the same strange metal,
would display this piece about one's waist, without diminshing the
otherworldly darkness at all.

pest strip begins to work.  First one of the little pests gets stuck on
the strip, then others come to investigate the pathetic mewlings of their
trapped and tormented kin and they too get stuck in their efforts to free
it.  One strip is usually good for clusters of 1 to 100 pests.  Any more

A gleaming line of red lines the blade of this viscious looking weapon. 
Upon closer examination it seems to be some sort of metal, and not just a
stain.  A small ruby has been inset into the hilt of this weapon, and has
a preternatural sparkle to it.  The krynite the weapon is made from seems
to be darker hued than you've seen before, more black than purple.

This dagger is shapped just like a serpents head and fangs.  Held upside
down, the pomel contains two sapphires that are the eyes of a large
snake, the handle is the head, and the two extended fangs cross over each
other.  Each fang is in fact a very sharp, double edged blade that
continues out of the handle for nearly six inches.  The whole dagger
seems to be made out of a solid piece of electrum, not a single seem is
visible anywhere.  The handle is wrapped in the skin of a red dragon,
contrasting nicely against the silverish of the electrum.

This couch can probably fit someone with a wide girth.  It's made of a
grayish stone, and it seems to be able to reflect light due to the polish. 
The gray wolf skins covering it are thick, making it comfortable to rest
upon.

metallic fragments, you are left with the momentary impression of bits of
fiery rock hurling through the night sky.

Congratulations, you have aquired a copy of the fine line of teaching
materials intended to help improve your building skills as an immortal. 
Where as the first book in the series, Immortality 101, was intended to
help hone your rough skills as a builder, this tome targets some of the
finer points of ettiquette and appearance.  Contained herein are several
of the smaller details often overlooked by starting imms.  By
implementing some of the ideas demonstrated you should be able to quickly
give your codes the appearance of a practiced master.
Welcome to @gImmortality 102@n.

one doors~
Though doors can be easy opened, occassionally you want to add a little
flash to a code.  Disable the ability to "open boulder" and change it
into something like move boulder so it reveals the cave behind.  All too
often though this is what you end up with: 
@y
   [ 1] if( find_stat( ch, str ) > 10 ) {
   [ 3]   act_tochar( #move_rock, ch );
   [ 5]   open( room, east );
   [ 7]   }
@n

Unfortunately this code will need a lot of work.
A much better format can be seen under @blook door2@n.
A preamble on how to set up this function is under @blook pre-door@n.
A word of caution though, don't let its looks overwhelm you.  I'll walk
you through and show you just how easy it really is.
~
E
door2~
This is what the corrected door code should look like.
@y
   [ 1] if( is_open( room, east ) ) {
   [ 3]   act_tochar( #is_open, ch );
   [ 5]   end;
   [ 7]   }
   [ 9] if( find_stat( ch, str ) > 10 ) {
   [11]   act_tochar( #move_rock, ch );
   [13]   act_notchar( #rmove_rock, ch );
   [15]   open( room, east );
   [17]   send_to_room( #rock_opens, find_room( 31000 ) );
   [19]   }
   [21] else {
   [23]   act_tochar( #too_heavy, ch );
   [25]   act_notchar( #straining, ch );
   [27]   }
@n

See @blook door3@n for a breakdown of this if you need one.
~
E
door3~
lines 1-7 Do a check to see if the door is already open.
This prevents spamming it open or opening it if it already is open.

If the "door" is closed, then it procedes to line 9, checking to see if
they are strong enough to move it.  If they are then...
  They get a message they open it (line 11)
  Everyone in the room sees them open it (line 13)
  The door is opened (line 15, unseen thus the messages)
  People in the adjacent room notice the boulder moved
  (line 17)

Else (if they are not strong enough)
  They strain themselves trying (line 23)
  And everyone notices the obvious attempt (line 29)
~
E
A checklist~
Things to always think through in coding:

@c-@nDid you inform the player what they see?  (act_tochar)

@c-@nWould others notice the player doing it?  (act_notchar)

@c-@nIs the effect noticable in other rooms?  (act_notchar)
 (doors being opened/shut, loud/significant noises,
  characters arriving via a transfer function)

@c-@nIf its a code to open something, should there be another
 so they can close it as well?
~
E
pre-door~
To set up a room code like this one, simulating a boulder being moved
instead of having it as a simple "door" you would need to do the
following: 

Set the connection between the rooms as a door with @bdedit@n.
Set the @bdflag@ns for is_door, closed, secret, pickproof, no_open,
    and reset_closed

Then used @baedit@n to create a new function in the room.

aset command none
aset trigger move
aset target boulder

(remember to add extra descs so people can examine the boulder)

Then you're ready to insert the acode.  All the major commands you need
to use are highlighted and you should be able to find help on them.
~
E
ettiquette b~
A few simple rules of thumb when dealing with other immortals
areas/objects/mobs: 

If the imm is still active here, mail them and ask them to make changes. 
Sometimes what seems like a mistake to you and others may, in fact, be
intentional and with good reasons.

If the imm is no longer active, don't change anything unless you have to. 
Usually its a good idea to check around and see who, if anyone, has taken
over care of an area.  Sometimes an active imm has a tentative "claim" on
control over an area.  Usually this means they are in the process of
fixing problems.  They may like the help or you may make things worse.

@gMost importantly@n, unless there is a dire bug involved just don't
tamper with open areas.

Imms lower than 93 should remain invis. (its policy)
~
E
two transfers~
Transfers are much like door codes in the problems that accrue around
them.  Here's an example of what a good transfer code might looke like:
@Y
   [ 1] if( is_fighting( ch ) ) {
   [ 3]   act_tochar( #use_flee, ch );
   [ 5]   end;
   [ 7]   }
   [ 9] act_tochar( #climbs_tree, ch );
   [11] act_notchar( #rclimbs_tree, ch );
   [13] transfer( ch, find_room( 11000 ) );
   [15] act_notchar( #arrives, ch );
   [17] loop( followers ) {
   [19]   ch = rch;
   [21]   acode( room, 1 );
   [23]   }
@n
I've included a run down of this one under @blook transfer2@n
~
E
transfer2~
Lines 1-7 are often forgetten.  Transfers, typically, should not be a
means to escape combat.  This prevents such an abuse.

lines 9-15 give all the basic info, though I've forgone a skill check. 
If they were to climb a tree or something then you'd want to include a
check for success as well as lines to tell the character they failed and
tell anyone else in the room they attempted and failed.

Lines 17-23 run a check so all followers will go with whoever is leading
them.  We can't, at this time, check for sleepers, so sleepers will be
dragged along as well.  We asked players once and they said they'd rather
have leader/follower take precedence over safe sleeping, so its up to
them to remember where these things occur.

To do this code justice, we should also add checks to see if the being
checked is flying (for automatic sucecss) and if they can climb at all
(as some pets can not).  For an indepth example I suggest checking
acode 1 in room 38500.
~
E
mortals c~
When dealing with mortals always remember we have to follow rules as much
as they do.

If you're unlder level 93, you should be invis.  Don't talk to mortals.

When dealing with mortals you should ALWAYS be visible.  If you won't own
up to your deeds you probably shouldn't be working here.

If you warn someone of something @bpbug@n their account.
If you can't pbug, then leave a note for someone else to on imm board.

Some useful help files reguarding dealing with mortals:
@bcrimes@n, @bpolicies@n, @bnames@n, @bnames2@n, @bappearance@n,
@bdescription@n, and @bmuliplay@n.

You see a deck of crimbul cards setting on a gaming table.  The deck is
obviously a fine one made from thin slivers of laquered tortoise shell. 
The cards have all had the same dark green pattern shot through with
silver strands painted onto the backs so you can neither see the image
painted on the front nor tell what card it might be by variations in the
natural shell patterning.  Each card has been laquered to preserve the
images painted on them and to help preserve the card itself from wear and
tear.

If you wanted to play a game or two of crimbul with someone, perhaps you
should @blook@n at the @brules@n.
~
E
rules~
In turn each participant will @bdraw@n their own @bhand@n.

At any time the dealer can @breshuffle@n all cards back into the deck so
the game can start over.  In the case of a reshuffle, everyone will
return their hands to the deck.

After the initial hand is drawn, most variants of the game allow one
chance to keep your hand or @bimprove@n your @bhand@n by exchanging a few
cards.  Alternatively you can choose to @bredraw@n your entire @bhand@n
if you feel your luck will be bad with your current one.  Often either of
these actions can result in a worse hand, though sometimes they can
improve your hand.

the lowest hand played in a game, it trumps all others to win.  If more
than one Beggar's Blessing turn up in one round though, neither is
considered the lowest in the game and normal card order is retained.

*** imm_note ***~
If a player manages to leave the location of the deck with a hand of
cards still on them they will be unable to remove or get rid of them. 
Simply have them return to the location of a crimbul deck and
@breshuffle@n the deck.  The cards will be automatically removed and
returned where they belong.


To help prevent this from happening, copy opcode #4 off the deck and
install it in the room the deck is housed in.  Set it to trigger leaving
and flag all directions.  Short of getting summoned out, that should
alleviate the potential problem from occuring.

Though crimbul is played by many levels of society, lets say we are
working with people dealing in silver for the moment.

Many games start with an ante.  Ours will be 1 silver.

Players each draw their hand (usually holding them).

If a player is satisfied with their hand they are done.
If a player wishes to draw again they must ante up double their last ante.
(In some games this allows for as many redraws as players wish to allow,
often a cap is set at a predetermined amount though).  In most games only
one redraw is allowed, and would cost in this case 2 silvers.

Though many house rules abound, the one traditional house rule followed
is that whenever a hand of stones is drawn the drawer must ante the
starting ante again.  1 silver in this case.

(continued under @blook bet2@n)
~
E
bet2~
Another common house rule is that everyone must ante the starting ante
again whenever the Beggar's Blessing is drawn (except for the person or
persons who drew the Blessing).  If, however, it is drawn by more than
one person in a hand the reante is still ony entered once.  In our
example this would be only 1 silver.  If anyone refuses to pay up the
ante they automatically bow out from that hand.

Another house rule sometimes observed, though not universally, is that
the order of precedence which a Full Moon and Full Moon Rising take are
switched if is night.  Presumably as a Full Moon at night is more useful
than one that is just starting to rise whose light is dimmed by the
treeline, mountainline, or nearby buildings.
This house rule is commonly observed by the citizenry of Medienne who
claim the rule itself was originated in their fair town.

A collection of six cards representing the highest hand a player can draw
in the game of Crimbul.  The cards show this to be a fine set made from
extremely thin tortois shell, fine paints and good laquer.  You'd almost
swear the silver used in the suite of swords is real silver and not just
imitation metal.

Carved from pure ice, this statue looks like it should melt at any moment. 
And yet, something is obviously preventing the icy figure from melting. 
Standing about eight inches tall, the statue depicts a humanoid creature
with all the grace of an elf but with a much more alien beauty.  The
detail work of the figurine is astonding, from the leaf scale armor it
wears to the tiny wooden swords it wields in either hand.  The facial
features of the statue are more akin to a pixie or sprite than any other,
having a mischievous grin and pointed ears.

Too smooth to be pumice and not vitreous enough to be obsidian, this dull
rock is riddled with cracks.  Though its origins are of a volcanic
nature, you are uncertain exactly what kind of rock it is.  The majority

This dark orange jewel has several facets, each spreading in a radial
pattern.  The pattern begins along the jewel's bottom edge, where it

cut.

Within the dark orange gemstone, there appear to be minute fluctuations

A large table of sturdy oak with a wooden wheel mounted atop it that can
be freely spun in either direction.  A flexible pointer is mounted on one
edge of the table and just just over the rim of the wheel in a set place. 
Pegs just up from the wheel's rim seperating it into 7 distinct wedges of
color.  Each wedge is marked with only one color; red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, or violet.  A @yplaque@n on the table's front seem's to
have the rules listed on it.
~
E
plaque~
The cost to play is one silver per spin.

simply @bbet@n on the @bcolor@n of your choice and you will purchase a
chit for that color.

When everyone playing is ready, someone must @bspin@n the @bwheel@n. 
When it stops, everyone with a winnig chit will be reimbursed.  All other
chits will be returned for the next round of betting to occur.

Only one winning chit will be reimbursed per person, all others will be
returned the same as losing chits.  (In other words, don't buy more than
one of any color per spin) 

A winning chit earns you 3 silvers back.

Made of four smaller pyramids melted together at the tips and hollow at
the center, this glass object is fairly hefty.  Whether it is a weight
for parchment, a weapon, or simply an object of art, it is uncertain. 
The only thing unusual about the pyramidal object is that within its
center there is a dancing display of swirling air, like a cloud.  The
cloud moves in no particular pattern.

This small key is about five inches long.  Crafted from silver, the key
has a brilliant sheen to it.  The handle of the key has been fashioned
into a dragon's head, whose features are both noble and fierce.  The
dragon's neck merges effortlessly into the mid-section of the key, its
scaly details blending carefully into the metal.  The dragon's eyes, two
miniscule drops of amber, peek out from the top of the key and seem to
gaze upon you.

This leaf is quite unique, being five-lobed and edged in brilliant white. 
Its color is exact green generally seen on a newly sprouted leaf.  Four
round serrated lobes grow symmetrically from a central stem, topped by a
fifth lobe at the end of the stem.  The fifth lobe is a long ovular
shape, ending in a point.  The green of each lobe is bordered by a thin
line of white, a quite pretty delineation.  Small hairs cover all
surfaces of the leaf, giving it a fleshy, velvety texture.

A bracelet of the purest white silver encircled by five brilliant
diamonds, this heavily enchanted item of good provides great powers to
its wearer.  What was once evil and corrupt about the black diamonds is
gone; only light and goodness remains.

This suit of boiled leather armor is covered in scratches and gashes made
from many years of battling.  Several intricate runes have been etched
into its surface around its edges.  Upon its breast the image of a white
shield with a fiery red phoenix with its wings outstretched has been
embroidered.  Despite its appearance, it looks as if it could still offer
medium protection when used in combat.

Made of sharpened steel, the butcher's knife extends about six inches

A small handle made of wood has elegant, undecipherable runes carved into
it.  Written from the bottom of the hilt to the top, the runes become
nothing more than a carved swirl focusing your eyes on the long steel

Formed from the finest of adamantine metals, this weapon is designed to
be strapped across the top of a person's hand by use of the attached
leather buckle.  Very large spikes protrude from the top of the
adamantine sheet across the knuckle plating which are very sharp and
dangerous to the punch.

Made of opaque, green glass, this bottle has a large cork stopper wedged
into its mouth.  About six inches in height, the flask has a bell-shaped
bottom that tapers upward like the neck of a wine bottle.  In lieu of
having a label stuck to its front, the flask has an intricate tooling of
runes.
~
E
after~
Though made of opaque green glass, you can see wisps of elemental energy
coalescing around the fringes of this flask.  Though tightly stopped with
a wedge of cork, the flask seems ready to pour forth its contents at any
moment.  Multiple series of runes, each of which invokes a different
elemental plane or demi-plane, have been etched onto the front surface of
the flask.

Standing six inches tall, this short figurine has been mounted to a
wooden base.  Crafted from copper, the figurine depicts a young human
female.  She has the body of a young woman just blossoming into
adulthood, long pigtails, and wears a long but casual dress.  The detail
work of the figurine is such that you can even make out the patterning of
the lace on her dress.  The figurine holds a basket in her tiny hands.
~

wooden base~
Cut from a single piece of oak, this circular base to which the figurine
has been attached feels lighter than it should.  In fact, it feels hollow. 
Sticking out of the bottom of the wooden base is a small brass key.  The
edges of the key have just begun to tarnish.

Crafted from pure adamantium, this toy soldier looks to be a mechanical. 
A tiny turn key protrudes from its back.  However, the most unusal thing
about the toy soldier are its features.  They are those of a gnome!  And
A cheerful little gnome at that.  He is short of stature and supports a
nicely rounded tummy.  He looks like a toy who is quite happy at being a
toy soldier and having a dead minnow for a weapon.  Dark brown hair
covers his head, and he carries with pride his rather prominent gnomish
schnozz.  The only other truly noteworthy features are his grey eyes. 
The iris of each eye is not solid in color, but has a strange smoky
appearance, shifting between lighter and darker colors of gray.  This toy
soldier looks incredibly life-like and real.

This bloody tunic is just slightly smaller then the typical adult garment. 
Made of slightly tougher material to withstand the wear and tear of
children, this garment looks almost new, except for the tattered slash
that crosses the breast of it.  Faint red stitching is evident set inside
the collar of this garment.

This stone figurine depicts a fire drake.  The serpentine cousin to
dragons is generally found only in lava pools or deep within the heart of
the earth.  This carving is so lifelike that it seems ready to slither
out of your hand.
On the bottom of the carving is a tiny inscription.

                From fire and lava drawn,

Made from thick but splendid hides, this pair of gloves is quite large
and has no finger tips to speak of.  While they might easily fit over an
enlarged hand, they do not seem likely to be as protective as the quality
of the hide suggests.  Tiny bumps cover the surface of the gloves, giving

Two inches wide uniformly, this belt is almost a quarter inch thick and
lonk enough to encircle around the most generous waistline.  A silver
buckle fashioned into the shape of a star allows for the belt to be
adjusted for comfort.  The backside of the belt has a scaly texture and
is made up of tiny, leaf-shaped scales that interlock tightly with one
another.  Etched into each scale is a geometric series of symbols.

back geometric symbols~
The back of the red leather belt is composed of tough, leaf-shaped scales. 
Upon each scale, of which there are hundreds, is an engraved symbol
composed of multiple geometric symbols.  The first of these symbols

Tooled along the top and sides of the boots, in silvery-white thread, are
feathery designs of dragons in flight.  The soles of the boots are made
of tough, bark-like material.  The boots, if worn, would rise to just

Truly a work of art, this helm may have very well been crafted by the
god's themselves.  Designed to protect the god's chosen, this helm is
still a wonder just to look upon.  Created for the practical fighter, the
helm has been crafted so as to not obstruct peripheral vision though
still remain protective.  The purple hue of the metal lends a nice
balance to the gold trimming that adornes it.

These delicate beads have been carved from blocks of grey onyx and red
sapphires.  Each of the beads has been polished to a beautiful shine
which causes all light to gleam off it and twinkle.  Upon each of the
beads are small, ancient runes of unknown origin which pulse with a dim
silver light.

Sheets of yellowed parchment have been bound together and covered with a
piece of leather.  The leather has been dyed grey and is very worn. 
Numerous burn and tear marks score its surface.  On its front cover are a
series of glyphs that look to be magical in nature.

part1~
Golems are magical constructs without life, without mind, and without
soul.  I first learned about them from my childhood guardian, an old,
wizened cleric too nice for his own good.  During the fifteen years he
raised me, I witnessed him construct several golems with his feeble hands
and infuse them with power from his deity.
Being raised to succeed him as the head of the abbey, the cleric showed
everything to me, including the arcane and holy rituals necessary to
construct his golems.  He used the golems for the everyday tasks he could
no longer afford to pay servants for, such as guarding the abbey and
doing household chores.  Why he never sold off some of his worthless holy
relics I'll never know.
~
E
part2~
I learned as much from him as I could in the years I spent with him and
it was almost with regret that I killed him that night after he delivered
yet another stirring sermon to the magnificent crowd that had gathered in
the abbey that night.  I don't think I'd ever seen the abbey cat and her
kittens, the only ones in the audience, look so impressed with the
blustering old man.
I took what I could from the abbey before the golems he had tried
summoning to help him arrived and I fled into the night.
~
E
part3~
Several years passed since I had "left" the clergy.  I had spent the time
traveling from town to town, living by my wits alone and picking up
various types of lore from those I could.  It was then I came across a
sorcerer maybe ten years older than myself, outside of the town known as
Chiiron.  I talked with him well into the night, convincing him to take
me on as an apprentice.  Though he initially refused, insisting I was too
old to begin the training, I was able to 'convince' him with a handful of
jewels I still had left over from what I had stolen and sold from my
former guardian.
During the next two years I learned what I could from the foppish
sorcerer, though at times he tried my patience with the menial tasks he
would have me perform.  But I did them without flaw and with a certain
grace that the sorcerer himself lacked.
~
E
part5~
My goals were much larger than those of my first two masters.  Both had
power but did not know how to use it.  Where one had wasted his skills
guardian the holy relics of a deity long forgotten and the other traveled
from city to city performing magical tricks, I was determined to use my
powers for something much more definitive - like taking over the world!
~
E
part4~
Having learned what magic I could from him, I visited upon him the same
fate that befell my first master.  Sneaking upon him during the night, a
well-placed dagger in the back afforded me the opportunity to make off
with all his belongs and spellbooks.  I escaped into the woods, where I
took up residence in a small cottage that had been left to the elements
for quite some years.  There I stayed and studied and experimented by
myself.
~
E
part6~
But in order to take over the world, mere power wasn't enough.  I needed
an army.  It was then that I came upon the idea of using golems.  For
five more years in that three room cottage I stayed, mixing both holy
ritual and magical power, trying to hit upon the perfect balance for
constructing powerful golems.
Having succeeded in constructing my first golem, I was never more proud. 
I also realized that within but a little time, my goal of world conquest
is all but assured...

~
E
note1~
During my experimentations with constructing golems, I learned several
things: First, it is imperative that you always start with a freshly
constructed idol of the golem you wish to create.  The process of
creating a golem requires that you infuse something made into the shape
of a living creature with raw power, forcing it to grow to the size and
shape you want it to.
~
E
note2~
Secondly, depending on a person's nature, you will have more success with
icons that are made from materials that correspond with your aura. 
Golems made from organic materials are much easier and cheaper to
construct, but they tend to be unruly and hard to control.  Also, they
tend to obey those with evil intentions more readily than any others.
~
E
note3~
Now, golems made from metal, on the other hand, are much more pliable and
obedient.  They are also much more expensive to create.  But that is one
of the reasons why I decided to move my operation into the old mines.  It
was a good source for metal.
I found that I had more ease, though, making golems out of stone.  It
never mattered what type of stone.  Be it crystal or granite, I could
infuse the idols for these golems more easily than any others.

This rod is approximantly two feet long and an inch and a half in

all but the last five to six inches of one end of this gleaming piece of
solid glass.

This ancient cutlass is made from a light, silvery metal similar to

underwater, it seems to be in excellent condition.  Fine runes are etched

This small toy frost giant is made from layers of fine blue velvet
stuffed with soft down feathers.  It's small eyes are made from the
purest blue sapphires you have ever seen.  Its long white beard flows
down to its waist and has been braided like a real frost giant's.  Within
its hand is a miniature ice battle axe which it grips tightly.

Standing atop its back is a graceful bird without wings.  Perched atop

This large chest is made of finely polished cedar wood.  It gives off a
faint, sweet scent, though it is obviouslt many years old.  Carved into
the top of the chest in elvish runes are a few indecipherable words.  A
lovely butterfly worked in silver has been engraved onto the locking

Within the banner are a grouping of letters.  The hilt of the short sword

The decaying corpse of a small humanoid creature, only the tattered
remains of wispy wing stumps remain to tell you it must have once had the
ability to fly.  After wiping away some of the dark, viscous ooze that
covers the body you can tell it also must have once been a very colorful
creature as well.  A gentle squeeze of the chest cavity produces a
gurgling trickle of slime from its tiny mouth.  Since there seems to be
no other injury on the sprite perhaps it died of drowning?

The table is built low for use while sitting upon the floor.  Its wood is

Curving elegantly above an obsidian-hued staff, the shining mithril blade
seems almost aesthetic in its simplicity.  Only five feet from blade tip
to spear haft, the weapon is still exquisitely balanced.  The design of
the piece leads one to believe it was crafted by a master weaponsmith for
a specific warrior.  Shimmering silver inlay into the shaft outlines a
rampant ebon figure painstakingly etched in breathtaking detail.

Looking closer, you see the Black Unicorn almost come to life, staring

fury.  The raven-hued staff seems to heat in your hands, and you get an
unsettling feeling this blade was not crafted for you.

Though made of solid gold the color of sunset, this shield seems

dividing its front surface into quadrants.  In each quadrant is a
different heraldic design.  In the top left corner is a unicorn while
across from it stands a fierce lion in the middle of a silent roar. 
Below the unicorn is a field of stars and beside it is a strange etching
that almost looks like a small map.

Made from bluish-hued mithril and polished to a bright shine, this
shortsword appears to be a very sturdy fighting weapon.  The hilt is made
from white ivory shaped like a coiled dragon.  The pommel, which is the
dragon's head, holds a small black pearl which glistens in the light.

These slouch boots have been made from soft grey leather sewn together
with black thread.  Their tops have been purposely cuffed over allowing
the tops of the boots to rise just below the knee.  Extra leather was
used in the making of the boots to give the impression of bagginess.

This piece of dragon skin is from the soft underbelly of a green dragon
and judging by the softness of the scales, a very young one at that. 
Droplets of blood still ooze from the lacerations across its surface and
only a small portion of it would be usable for anything.

The crushed and defeated remains of a bird lay pounded into the ground. 
Grime-covered feathers, once proud and beautiful, are now ripped and bent
by the ravages of battle.  One wing lays askew at an angle not natural to
living birds, while the other is mangled beyond identification.

This small, silver urn is blackened with tarnish.  Its base is a stylized
sword hilt with a flat pommel.  For handles, six miniature weapons plung
into the urn's sides.  On the front surface of the urn is an engraved
epitaph.

epitaph engraved~
The epitaph engraved upon the surface of the urn is old and faded. 
However, much of it can still be read: 

Forged in fire, soft as silk,
Strong as steel were all her ilk.
Master of the force, and magic too,
May Alegra's spirit soar through and through.

The mortal remains of no ordinary spider, this corpse is larger than most
animals and some people.  However it is curled into a tight ball, all
eight legs pulled in as tightly in death as any normal spider.  A foul,
dark green ichor slowly seeps from various battle wounds, the obvious
cause of its recent death.

This beautiful ring was obviously expertly crafted.  It's design appears
to be ancient, yet the band shines of a polished silver.  A perfectly
cut, spherical pearl sits in the center, getting your immediate attention. 
It's held to the band by two tiny strands of silver that criss cross over
the top.  The pearl glows with a faint purple light and feels warm to the
touch.

This throne is mammoth in size and could only be used by a being of

This extravagant bench must have once been worth a fortune, but now its
