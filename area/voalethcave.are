Narrow Tunnel~
In the narrow, suffocating confines of this tunnel, breathing is
difficult.  The stone is spongy and cold, swept with a thin coat of moss. 
To the west a broad fissure, large enough for an ogre to enter, opens
into a larger cave.  To the east, the narrow tunnel grows very dark.

Narrow Tunnel~
The walls press in tightly as the constricting tunnel continues.  The
stone here is mottled, as this is the meeting point of two rock types. 
To the west are limestones and shales, while to the east is hard granite. 
The tunnel continues to the east where there is only darkness, or to the
west where, amid a nebulous field of black, is a slash of light.

Enormous Cavern~
This huge cavern stretches in all directions, the walls and ceiling lost
in darkness.  A forest of stalagmites soars, stretching to meet
stalactites forty feet high.  Moisture drips from the ceiling like rain,
and from the east comes the sound of running water.  To the west, set in
the stone, is a narrow fissure leading back into the wall.

From the east comes the sound of running water.  To the west, a titanic
black stalagmite towers over all others.  Stalagmites stand to the north

Black Stalagmite~
A mountainous black stalagmite looms over the dim cavern, reaching so

from the distant east, though the louder sound here is that of dripping. 
Fat droplets of water fall onto the stalagmites, building them inexorably
higher.

Bank of River Hurgrot~
The raging River Hurgrot churns to the east, while to the west a grove of
stalagmites rises sharply.  To the south, the river bends around a
jutting finger of rock.  A fine mist condenses here on the cool
stalagmites, forming sinuous rivulets of water that wind and twist along
the stalagmites' ridged surfaces.

Mist rises from the River Hurgrot, churning angrily over massive
underwater boulders.  The mist condenses quickly in the cool air and
forms thin lines of water on the surrounding stone.

stalagmite stalagmites~
Eons are required to form stalagmites as large as these, as surface water
sifts through the earth, gathering minerals, and finally penetrates the
cavern ceiling.

Bank of River Hurgrot~
The rocky bank slopes eastward to the edge of the mighty River Hurgrot,
which pours from the a low, broad tunnel in the cavern's north wall.  The
thunderous rush of the river drowns all other noise as it echoes off the
stones and stalagmites of the cave's deepest recesses.  On the bank,
here, someone has constructed an ornate pile of stone.

Cavern of Falling Water~
This cavern is filled with an unnatural light.  A powerful waterfall
plummets through a broad opening in the high ceiling of this cavern and
runs down the south wall, to disappear into another broad opening.  This
entire cavern is filled with moss and huge plants with wide, glossy
leaves.  The mist is so thick it is almost blinding.  The area looks to
have been cultivated, with fruit-bearing plants growing in stone pots.  A
shaft of soft, pallid light shines through the opening on the ceiling.

The Throne of Ice~
This enormous room is circular and covered with large, twisting runes. 
Against the north wall sits a throne of ice, simple in design, blocky
with the back and armrests of equal height.  A blistering wind tears
through this room, seeming to sweep up from all directions, swirling tiny
motes of frost and ice in the bitter air.

The water-slicked rocky shore plunges toward the raging currents of the

Caverns of Voaleth - North Wall~
The dry, ancient stone has given way here, piling the floor with dust and
large, jagged boulders.  To the west is a large granite outcropping,
which juts from the north wall, preventing movement to the west.  the
north wall is deeply gouged with cavernous holes where the fallen
boulders were once lodged.  The mottled walls are brown-red, the color of
dried blood, and soar upward to the enshrouding darkness.  To the east
and south is darkness.

The Caverns of Voaleth~
The dry air is still and quiet, and the oppressive darkness stretches in

crawling over the many granite slabs and boulders that lie here.  From

Sharp, foot-high stalagmites jut from a pile of rubble on the rocky floor. 
A heavy groan passes through the surrounding rock, jarring the dust and

Narrow Cavern~
This tight, narrow tunnel winds around an enormous stone outcropping on
the south cavern wall.  The air here is cold and very still, the silence
broken only by the soft, regular dripping of water.  The narrow tunnel
turns to the south, and to the west opens up into the massive caverns of
Voaleth.

Dead End in Cavern~
Rivulets of dark groundwater leak from holes in the three walls that form
this narrow enclave.  The water trickles through soft pads of moss then
coats the floor with a thin layer of water and slime.  On the floor is a
large, dark hole.  The tunnel heads toward a bend to the north.

Middle of the River Hurgrot~
The River Hurgrot churns powerfully, the raging, dark water smashing into
a foam against massive granite boulders that jut from surface.  A icy
mist hangs in the air, coating the shores and filling your lungs with a
permeating chill.  The river flows in from the north, and here bends
eastward.  Rising in the darkness to the south is a wooden bridge.  To
the west is a rocky riverbank, and to the immediate south is a finger of
rock which juts in from the west shore.

In the River Hurgrot~
Thick fingers of rock, their tips glistening black, jut from the churning
surface of the River Hurgrot.  The river comes in from the north,
breaking and foaming along its course.  To the east and west are the
rocky riverbanks.  To the south the river continues, and far to the north
rises the massive north wall of the cavern.

In the River Hurgrot~
The deafening roar of the River Hurgrot fills the air, echoing off the
cold stone and resonating in your ears.  The river plows through the
caverns of Voaleth, tearing away stone as it moves and coating the
surrounding rock with mist.  To the east and west are the mossy
riverbanks.  In the distance to the north rises the massive cavern wall.

In the River Hurgrot~
The River Hurgrot flows into the cavern through a massive, arched opening
in the north wall.  The river sounds like thunder echoing into the

towering stones that jut from the surface.  To the east and west are
rocky riverbanks, and to the south the river continues.

The floor sprawls out thirty feet below, and all around is darkness. 
Rubble comes bouncing down the enormous rockslide and goes crashing
against the floor, smashing into dust.  Above, the rockslide becomes far
too steep to climb, though several large, jagged rocks provide handholds
for the climb down.  To the east is a gaping alcove dug into the
rockslide.

Darkened Alcove~
A rotten, fetid stench, rising from sickening piles of goo around the
floor and in the corners, assails your nostrils.  This massive alcove is
rough and dirty, the walls smeared with feces and the floor covered with
rocks.  A pile of scattered hay against the north wall looks as if it
might serve as someone's bed.  To the west is an opening, leading down a
rockslide to the floor of this cavern.

Atop a Spiraling Stalagmite~
The tip of this stalagmite has been honed to a needle-like point, just as
the rest of the stalagmite has been carved into the shape of a spiral. 
The air up here is cool and still, and darkness stretches in all
directions.  From far to the west comes the sound of rushing water.  The
stalagmite heads down to the cavern floor.

Flooded Cave~
The still, cold waters of the flooded cave are interrupted only by the
constant dripping of water from the cavern ceiling.  Moss grows
abundantly, hanging down nearly in front of your face.  The flooded
tunnel continues east and south.  The stones on the western side of the
cave look a little different from the rest of the area.

Flooded Cave~
This moss-covered cavern tunnel is flooded with murky, cold water.  The
walls are covered with variations, slight indentations and bumps which
throw off your perception of depth and distance.  The flooded tunnel
leads north.
