Dark Chamber~
You are in a small chamber steeped in shadow.  The room is cold, and you
find yourself shivering involuntarily.  There are thousands upon
thousands of small stones in the room.  The only way to leave this area
is by climbing up out of the pit you stand in, or by following the
passage north.

Small Tunnel~
The tunnel narrows rapidly to the north, looking as though it may require
moving single file as it continues.  The hall is dusty, ill-kept, and
looks quite abandoned by living creatures.  There are many stones
scattered about the area, apparently thrown here from the room to the
south.

The tunnel is quite narrow here, requiring that you move single file as

stirred by your own movements.  The floor is rough, and the passage

The tunnel narrows to the south, probably requiring moving single file if

slabs of stone.  The passage bends here, going west and south.

Domed Chamber~
The chamber in which you stand is quite large, and framed in pillars of
solid marble.  Every wall and even the domed ceiling are covered in
frescoes, most of which were worn away with time.  The mosaic-tiled floor
stretches out in all directions, the only visible exits are an archway to
the west, and a heavy door to the east.

Forgotten Chamber~
Judging from the crude stonework and lack of ornamentation, you have
entered an extremely old area.  The ceiling is low, the air stale, and
the shadows deep.  The room is littered with rubble; thousands of small
stones have been placed in strange, haphazard piles with no apparent
purpose.

Burial Chamber~
This room has frescos covering its walls, ceiling, and floor.  From what
you are able to gather, they are concerned with funerary rites of some
kind.  Smashed wood, broken braziers, and assorted rubble litter the
floor.  The only visible exit from the room lies to the west.

Painted Room~
Done in white and black marble tiles, the floor is painfully reminiscent
of the chessboard laying elsewhere in the crypt.  The walls were probably
once covered from floor to ceiling with bright frescoes, although only
small fragments of the artisans' work remain.  There is a stout wooden
door to the west, and another portal to the east.

Narrow Tunnel~
There is a noticable shift in the style of construction here, the passage
to the north is obviously of even older construction than even what has
come before in this passage, perhaps only a little more sophisticated
than the catacombs of King Grattza.  The crude stonework of the tunnel
gives way to bare rock walls supported by timber bracings here.  You may
follow the tunnel north or east from here.

Narrow Tunnel~
The passage here is of construction almost as old as anything you have
seen in the crypts.  The crude stonework and timber construction of the
tunnel speaks of a style that is more similar to a mining shaft than a
catacomb.  A large stone is set into the north wall here, almost as some
kind of marker.  You may follow the tunnel south or east.

At last the black stairs yield, depositing you in a rectangular chamber. 
The room is sharply cut from dark black stone, with surfaces
intersecting one another at perfect right angles.  The room is large,
with the ceiling towering perhaps 30' or more above your head.

Sunken into the center of the room is a circular firepit, and
inscribed around its edge are hundreds of strange and unfamiliar symbols.

There are passages leading to the east and west.
