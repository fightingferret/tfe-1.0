Testing Grounds.  HardHats Required at all Times~
Grey moss hangs from the ceiling.  Brown clumps of dead vegitation litter
the floor.  Your feet squelsh as you walk over the muck scattered
across the rocks.

Ender's feeble Attempt.~
Hewn with dwarven picks, the sharp angles of the rocks glint back your
light at you.  All the vegitation has been cleared away from the center
of the room.  Standing from the center of the floor is an intricately
carved stand, with dwarven legends worked into the natural grain of the
stone.  Atop the stand floats a slowly rotating book encased in a liquid
flame.

The angles of the cuts are all sharp, witness to the fine 
handwork of dwarves.  However, the cracks are filled with dust
as no one has polished the stones in ages.

Ideas
Careful not to singe your fingers, you open the book.
"Well Greyclaw, or whoever is reading this, I will be doing most
of my idea spawning during class.  Which means it may 
APPEAR that I am slacking, when in truth I am creating ideas
offline.  Add ANY suggestions for this area here.  Please.
Cave like, renegade dwarves (?) motley shabbey crew.
sewers beneath, lots of garbage
pets belonging to dwarves?  possible?
traps abound, not too nasty, dump salamanders on you?
Living vines in the walls, pull you through floor occasionally.
lots of rotting type monster along with dwarves.
possibly walk into a fight in progress between and regular dwarf?
general map warren like, not TOO mazish.  couple of 1
way pitfalls.  find way out.  guarded treasure. (?)
GUARDED TREASURE???? (slaps self)  how GENERIC.  (bonks head against wall)
oh well.  add.  please.  (grovels)
one more.  This whole mud needs a history to it.
things feel kinda... disconnected.  need legends.  
I loved the references to clone wars in Starwarz books.  Think I will work
on something similar.

->I can see vines pulling into cracks in walls and/or floor, but through?
->rotting monsters and dwarves?
->Ideas seem good. Will check back later sometime.

Southern Warren~
Stooping as you weave through the narrow cave, the dominant feature is a
chasm which opens up to the north.  A narrow rope bridge staked to the
edge dips out across the chasm, to disappear into the darkness.  
~
[Rebekka] this room is called warren?

South Edge of Chasm~
You are standing at the edge of a giant chamber.  Hundreds of feet up,
bats flit in and out between the stalactites.  Forty feet down, you can
see bones scattered between the giant stalagmites.  An unstable but
well-kept rope bridge leads to the far side, and a small trickle of water
can be heard far below you.

water~
The water moves so slowly and is so far below you, it is hard to see
which way it flows.  The stream goes off to the west, and curves around
the stalagmites to disappear under you.  
~
E
bridge rope ropes~
They look secure enough.  Heavily braided fibers form a V shape,
walkable, but unstable.

#31504
Rope Bridge~
Looking over the edge, you can see the stalagmites staring straight up at
you.  They seem sharper from this angle.  Thirty feet to your south, the
bridge leads to a hole half way up the rock wall.  Forty feet to the
north, the bridge is anchored in an outcropping of rock.  Hundreds of
feet above you, huge stalactites point straight at you.  The bridge
slowly sways under your weight.  Fibers hang down from the bridge.  It
might be possible to slide down one of them.  However, it would be quite
hard to climb back up.  
~
[Hollie] need a act_tochar for everyone who gets hit by barbed bolt.

fibers~
Unwound by time, several fibers hang down from the massive main rope. 
They look strong enough to hold you, but climbing back up would be almost
impossible, as they are smooth strands and not coiled rope.

Floor of Chasm~
Like giant pillars, the stalagmites rise far above your head.  You can
barely squeeze between them as you pick your way over the uneven ground. 
A small stream of horrible smelling water flows out from the west and
disappears underground to the south.

North Edge of Chasm~
You are standing at the north edge of a giant open chamber.  It is nearly
50 feet from the tips of the stalactites above your head to the tips of
the stalagmites which surround you.  A simple way south appears to be via
a narrow bridge.

Sitting Area~
Seven chairs are arranged in a circle around a small wooden table in the
center of the room.  The table is covered with scratches and marks,
indicating what seems to be ancient on-the-fly battle plans.  Five foot
high tunnels through the solid rock lead north and west.

Hallway~
You are in a north-south hallway, with murals etched into the walls. 
Several showing dwarves shaking hands with other dwarves have been
defaced, with the faces of several of the dwarves chipped out of
existence.  The hallway's murals lead north and south, interrupted by an
opening to the east.
~
The actions south are using the status# in this room.

Camera Obscura~
The first thing to grab your eye is the giant white disk in the middle of
the room.  You slip a glance at it, and your jaw drops open as you see
what looks like an antelope bound across its smooth surface.  The rest
of the room is smooth black rock which seems to absorb all the light. 
There are several dangling ropes and multi colored levers in the corner
of the room.  A small button just below the levers also catches your
eye.

rope ropes~
Leading up through the ceiling and down through the floor, the four ropes
seem to slide easily up and down.  You give one an experimental tug, and
the moving pictures in the center of the room blur like you just got
bashed on the head.  
~
E
white disk table~
You gaze enthralled at the moving drawings on the floor.  You reach forth
your hand to touch the moving grasses only to find that the shadow of
your hand makes them disappear.  Shadow?  You look upwards to see a small
opening in the top center of the room; The light pouring through the hole
illuminates the dust floating around the room.

Hallway~
The sides of this hallway are covered with marred carvings.  You can just
make out scenes of dwarves in ferocious battle with angry-looking goblins. 
For some reason, the faces of the dwarves seem to have been gouged out. 
The hall appears to widen to the north, and heads south into darkness.

A Grimy Kitchen~
Your stomach churns as you step in to what you pray isn't the kitchen. 
Several gutted rabbits adorn the walls, slowly growing a pinkish fuzz. 
Along the floor, the ashes from many sputtering fires lie in a heap.
Looking up, you don't see a vent for smoke, perhaps that is the reason
why you are coughing.

The stench almost floors you as you enter this room.  A small hole in the

solid rock.

A glimmer of light shines from far above your head.  All around you, the

slop joins a small underground well here, trickling off towards the west.

Storage~
Cluttered with everything imaginable that the dwarves have managed to
haul in, the rock walls of this room are barely visible beneath all the
old junk.  Shelves of wood for the fires, and torches for the dark
tunnels suggest that the dwarves only go shopping once a year.  You kick
aside the garbage as you make your way into the middle of the room.

As you weave in and out between the stalagmites, you are able to

Storage Closet~
This tiny chamber is stuffed full of large crates.  The small amount of
bare floor you can see has bits of straw, torn cloth, and animal fur
sprinkled on its surface.  A small @blever@n appears just inside the room.

The floor is covered with debris from a number of sources: straw from the
crates, fur from maurading animals, and cloth possibly from those
