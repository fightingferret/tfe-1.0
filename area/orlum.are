corpses~
The corpses of many different woodland animals are stacked here against
the wall.  They appear to have been placed there on purpose from the
manner in which they are stacked.  You can also detect a very small crack
in the wall to the south, it's covered by most of the corpses.  
~
E
crack~
The crack runs up the south wall of the tunnel, to a height of about six
feet, west three feet, and back down to the floor of the tunnel.  
~
E
wall~
The wall appears to have a faint outline of a door on it.  There is no
visibile handle or keyhole though, perhaps it is just a trick of the eye
helped by your light.

Jailer's Office~
Carved from the living rock of the cavern, the jailer's office is a cozy
little room.  A small desk, along with a chair sit nearby the gate that
leads into the prisoner's cell.  The walls are bare, except for one
painting of a gnome that graces the northern wall.  To the south is the
iron gate that leads to the cell, while to the east you can head towards
the Home Guard's office.

Jail Cell~
The cell here is quite spartan.  The walls are bare, and have been
recently painted a sickly pink color.  The floor is smooth, the stone
probably worn down by the pacing of bored inmates.  A thick gate made of
iron set into the north wall provides the only means of exit.

Home Guard's Office~
Carved into the cavern wall, this curved chamber houses the Home Guard. 
Near the entrance sits a large desk, set so as to have a clear view of
those who enter.  A weapons rack and Home Guard uniforms hang along the
south wall in a iron cage.  In the west wall is carved a small archway,
leading to another chamber beyond.  To the east a small tunnelway exits
out into the Marketplace.

Inside the Gates of Orlumber~
A large flagstone courtyard sits behind a large and ornate set of steel
gates to the west.  A worn flagstone road leads north, alongside the wall
of the cavern.  To the south, another larger road heads towards a
bustling marketplace.  The steel gates almost totally cover the large
tunnel that leads out of the open cavern.  A large wall with a tile mural
blocks movement to the east.

West Market Entrance~
The wide road turns north and east, heading into a marketplace to the
east, and a small courtyard to the north.  A wide tunnel has been carved
out of the cavern wall to the west, leading into a small office. 
Flanking the entrance to the east are two massive brick pillars.  Atop
each sits a small granite bowl, water spilling down its side and
trickling down the pillars into a small pool.  The sound of the water is
soothing, and the air is cool and pleasantly damp.  Heavy red flagstones
pave the marketplace, and supporting heavy traffic.

Pyrope Street~
The flagstone road heads north and south, running between the cavern wall
to the west, and a row of homes to the east.  The large home to the east
is old and weatherworn, its wooden shingles warped and split with age. 
One of the windows has been boarded up, and weeds grow in the yard.  Just
to the south is a large open area, and what looks to be a massive steel
gate.

The worn and bumpy flagstone road leads north and south between the

separates the The house to the east from the road, and the wall has seen
better days.  Loose bricks in the wall threaten to collapse it, and an
old and bent iron gate rests against it at an angle.  You can follow the
road north or south.

Intersection of Beryl Road and Pyrope Street~
Beryl Road curves along the base of the cave wall, meeting with Pyrope
Street to the south.  Pyrope heads south, wending its way past the houses
of some of the inhabitants of Orlumber to the east.  The cavern wall
shoots straight up here, ultimately curving back on itself and showing
the open sky above you.  To the east you can see a wide bridge that
arches over a small stream that runs behind the houses.

Beryl Road - Arched Bridge Over a Small Stream~
A small bridge arches over a small stream that cuts through the stone
floor of the cavern.  The stream burbles merrily as its heads southward
underneath the bridge.  The water appears to come from a split in the
cavern wall to the north and spilling into a small pool just to the north
of the bridge.  Just to the west Beryl Road curves to the south,
following the curve of the cavern wall.  You can follow Beryl Road east,

The Marketplace~
The open shopping plaza known simply as the Marketplace spreads out
towards the east.  The wide flagstone paved courtyard is bounded by many
different styles of buldings, and luxurious trees are planted so as to
break up the monotony of the open space.  To the north sits a small shop
with ornate windows, occasional puffs of steam issuing from pipes in the
roof.  A stone building of large proportions rests firmly to the south, a
clean white smoke bursting in gouts from the stack on its roof.

A thick tangle of gleaming metal pipes and long glass tubes sit over

A hot forge burns white hot, as white smoke is sucked silently up a

thin layer of ash.  The stone walls seem to radiate heat, making this an
uncomfortable room to be in.  You can head out towards the marketplace to

shows that there is a lush garden beyond.  Aside from going through the

Sprigs of mint grow between the cobbles, releasing a pleasant scent into
the air.

The Marketplace~
Just to the north sits a small but quaint building with fanciful
stained-glass windows.  The stained oak door is wide open, inviting you
inside.  The open plaza is paved with flagstones and planted with large
trees and smaller shrubs.  Just to the northeast is a small and quiet
pond.  To the south an open-faced building rests, the smell of wax coming
from steaming vats in plain view.  You can head either east or west along
the plaza.

The Marketplace~
The calm blue waters of a small pond splash quietly along the grassy
shoreline just to the north of the plaza.  The pond rests in a shallow
hollow, and willow trees dot the shoreline, their long wispy branches
trailing into the waters.  A wooden pier heads north out into the lake. 
Just to the south, a smaller street cuts off the main Marketplace plaza,
and under a archway.  You can see several shops that line the road in
that direction, and the area appears to be much more upscale.  The main
plaza heads east and west towards more shops.

Intersection of Merchant's Lane and the Marketplace~
Heading south from the busy marketplace, this quiet tree lined lane heads
into a small shopping district.  From its looks, and the lack of
commoners, you would surmise this to be a wealthier part of town.  The
lane is paved with brick, and lined with flowering trees along each side
of the road.  To enter the lane you would pass under a large wrought-iron
archway, decorated with a creeping rose bush that dangles its flowered
vines from the arch.

doorway and several small leaded-glass windows.  The smell of food wafts
in from the gingerbread style building to the south.  To the northwest
you can see a small willow-lined pond with a small pier jutting out into
it.  The open plaza continues east and west.

The counter of this store is very close to the door, giving you very

vials.  On a desk in one corner you see a large number of feather pens,
and a stack of brown scroll paper that appears to be blank.  Above the
desk hang several purple balls of light hover in the air.  An open

This is one of the cleanest shops you have ever seen.  Weapons hang from

the wepaons.  Several small tabbards of the Home Guard hang from wooden
dowls in the back of the shop.  The heavy stone walls are clean and dust
free, with obviously used sets of weapons and old shields hanging as
decorations.  To the south you can head out the wide doorway.

To the north of the marketplace sits the rubble of a large stone building. 
The rubble has been cleaned up somewhat, so that the stones and broken
timbers rest off the plaza walkway.  To the south, a wooden door sits in
the middle of an imposing stone wall topped by thick, outwardly directed
iron spikes.  A small hedge also runs along the foot of the wall,
softening the harshness of its appearance.  You can walk along the
tree-dotted marketplace towards the west, or head east past a large and
imposing bulding.

Dominating the area is a large red-brick archway spanning the wide

foliage inviting you to pass beneath the arch and into the market.  To
the north a large building sits, thick stone walls with no windows or
other openings.  A large trellis has been attached to the wall, and
several small vines are beginning to grow on it.  To the south sits a
rather large and imposing building made of polished black granite.  You
can head west towards the marketplace or east towards an open plaza
before a huge temple.

west a large archway interrupts the stone wall running to from the north
to the south.  Beyond the archway the path becomes a cobbled road
bustling with people on the move.  The path splits to the east and the

The cave wall is split by several large cracks here, testament to the
time of the collapse of the Great Dome.  The lane itself shows signs of
repair in places, newer bricks replacing those that must have been
shattered in the cataclysm.  An overpowering smell of tallow comes from

Steam and heat greet you as you enter this building.  Huge bronze kettles

Piles of low-grade coal and chopped wood are stacked near the burning
fires that heat the kettles.  The coal is poor quality, and useless for
anything other than a low-heat fire.  The wood is not quite dry, and
looks as though it would burn slowly.

countless feet.  Just to the south, a shattered building wall stands
defiantly, refusing to collapse.  Beyond the wall you can see a heap of

Clouds of black smoke belch from the building to the south, and even from

out of the open top of the cavern.  You can follow the road west or head

Brickworks~
Clouds of reddish dust boil through the hot air, swirling about as the
heated air rises.  The sounds of raging fires burn deep within the guts
of the large building, firing the kilns that heat and dry the bricks. 
Empty and half-full crates sit near stacks of completed bricks.  In the
center of the room is a huge hole in the ground, from which an endless
stream of buckets filled with red clay seem to be coming.  To the east
you can exit the brickworks.

Common House~
The dirty floor is covered in a sticky layer of red clay that seems to
have been tracked in from the west.  Seven cots line the north and south
walls respectively, each neatly made with crisp and clean sheets.  Along
the east wall sits a large table with several chairs pushed underneath it. 
A sturdy wooden staircase heads up towards the second floor.  There is a
heavy ash door on the west wall.

Olivine Avenue~
The road comes to a dead end herem curving into a sweeping cul-de-sac
boarded on the east and west by large buildings.  To the south is a dense
row of stately willw trees, lazily dragging their drooping branches on
the ground.  To the north, the worn flagstone road heads towards an
intersection near the cavern wall.

A Narrow Alley~
Two crumbling buildings stand on each side of the narrow walk.  The doors
of each are missing, and despite the extensive damage the walls appear to
be somewhat stable.  The building to the west is made mostly of wood, and
it looks like the roof has caved in.  The eastern building is a built of
a solid and dark brick, and appears to have fared better than the other
buildings in the area.  The narrow alley leads north and south.

Shattered Remains of a House~
Splintered timbers and cracked planks fill most of the space inside this
shattered building.  Large stones and boulders lay inside the crumpled
walls, most likely the cause of the destruction of this building.  It
looks as thought every inch of the place has been stripped of everything
of value, as nothing but bare wood and rusty nails remain.  You can walk
through a gaping hole in the east wall and out into the alley.

Flophouse~
The dark stone walls of this bleak building give it a somber and
depressing air.  Stinking piles of cloth and straw are scattered about
the room, apparantly beds of some sort.  The air reeks of sweat, and a
clinging dust covers most every surface.  It is difficult to find a clear
space on the floor to walk, as it appears quite a few people call this
home at one time or another.  An open doorway leads out into the alley to
the west.

To the east a burned out shell of a house sits, its walls blackened by
fire.  Empty windows and doors stare out onto the alley, unblinking and
sightless.  The brick walls hold deep rifts of ash within, and burnt
timbers lay about like shattered bones.  To the west of the alley a small
home appears to have come through much of the cataclysm unscathed,
however huge boulders and wreckage from the surrounding buildings litter
the area around the building.  To the alley continues to the north and

building appears to have been left alone ever since the Cataclysm.  A

Large piles of shattered brick mingle with heavy stones making the alley
even narrower here.  Much of the brick appears to be from the destroyed
building to the west, which has collapsed into the street.  Sitting next
to the alley on the east side is a rather large and impressive structure. 
Its windows have been boarded up, as has its door.  Despite this, and the
obvious fire damage, the building appears in decent shape.  The alley
merges out onto a street to the north, and continues to wind its way
through the rubble to the south.

under the reaching branches of a citrus tree bursting with scented
flowers.  After circling the fountain, the pathway wanders north and off

Comfortable Garden~
Swaying willow trees shade this yard, while a tiny fountain gurgles
gently in one corner.  A curving pathway leads indirectly to the plain
front door of the brick building.  Soft, green grass carpets the ground,
except beneath the willows, where a bed of baby's breath seems to fare
better in the shade.  High stone walls encircle the yard, overgrown with
ivy and flowering vines of various sorts.  Set into the stone wall is a
heavy iron gate, ornately wrought and emblazoned with a crest.

Garden Before a Brick House~
Lush trees and well-kept bushes line the stone pathway that leads to the
ornate front door of the brick building to the west.  Shuttered windows
flank the door, and also look down from above on the second floor.  A
small iron bench sits under one of the trees, providing a place to relax
and enjoy the garden.  A gate leads east and out of the garden.

Lavish Entryway~
Heavy tapestries and gilded mirrors hang along the walls of this cramped
but stylish entry.  A dark-stained cherry wood stairway climbs up towards
the second floor, curving gently as it rises.  The floor is white-veined
black marble tile, and thick rugs cover much of it.  A small coatrack
sits quietly to the side of the door.  Two open doorways lead out of the
room, one to the south, they other to the west.  You can go out the front
door to the east.

Small Tunnel - Behind the Ivy~
You are in a tiny cave, with barely enough room to move inside.  A steep
tunnel dives down, looking like it might be a tight squeeze.  The curved
walls have been scratched out of the hard stone.  Dust and pebbles litter
the floor, making footing dangerous.  To the west a thick blanket of ivy
hangs down, covering the tiny mouth of the cave.

Tunnel Spiraling Downwards~
The tunnel spins downward into the darkness below you.  Rough stone and
many small ledges provide plenty of hand and footholds for you in
climbing up or down.  The tunnel twists and turns several time as it
leads up and down.  At several points it looks like the squeeze will be a
tight one.  From below you hear the sound of dripping water echoing

from a picture rail that also rims the room.  A fine staircase carved
from oak climb up towards a barely visible trapdoor.

Dead End on Beryl Road~
The hard packed dirt road ends here in a deep pile of rubble and stone. 
Huge blocks of stone and piles of rubble litter the road, as it appears
nobody has even tried to clean up the mess here.  Ivy has begun to grow
over the stones, and hangs off them in a thick and tangled mass of vines. 
The cracked and splintered cave wall looms above you to the north,
running alongside the northern edge of the road as it makes its way
eastward.

Common House - Second Floor~
The old wooden floor is quite scuffed and worn.  Several galvanized tubs
sit around the room, filled with steaming and murky water.  Next to each
is a small table built into the wall.  Windows built high on the walls
look out to the west, while skylights let in more light during the day. 
A wooden staircase leads down.

Small Pier on the Lake~
This carefully crafted wooden dock sits far out into the middle of the
pond.  High rails prevent you from falling off, while still allowing you
a view out onto the calm, blue waters.  Out here it is calm, the willows
that rim the pond almost encircle you, and you are isolated from the
bustle of the town.  A small sign is posted on the rail here.  You can
head south, back along the pier towards the marketplace.

Entry Room in the Brick House~
The entry to the brick house is a large and open room.  Along the north
wall a stairway climbs up towards the second floor, a decorative carpet
cushioning the stairs.  Resting against the wall next to the door is a
small side-table make of oak.  A large painting dominates the south wall,
sticking out like a sore thumb against the striped wallpaper.  A solid
oak door is set into the east wall.  An open doorway leads west into
another room of the house.

The Sitting Room in the Brick House~
This cozy room is furnished with all sorts of cushiony and fanciful
furniture.  Every inch of the walls is taken up with paintings,
memoribilia(sp?) and decorative wallpaper.  There is so much furniture
and junk in here that it is difficult to find a place to walk.  Two large
windows face east, towards the wall of the cavern and a garden below.  An
ornate set of stairs leads down.  To the west is a dark oak door.

Kitchen in the Brick House~
Cabinets line the north wall, while a heavy iron stove is set next to a
long marble countertop.  The wall near the stove is covered in decorative
tiles depicting various farm animals.  Inside the cabinets are dishes and
glasses arranged in neat little rows.  A small window along the west wall
is ajar, letting in a cooling breeze.  An open doorway leads east into
another room of the house.

Bedroom in the Brick House~
This bedroom is a cluttered mess.  Clothes have been thrown haphazardly
about the room, and piles of old bed sheets are thrown in the corner. 
Several paintings hang at odd angles on the dirty walls, and dust covers
the surface of most everything.  A shuttered window looks westward.  To
the east is a oaken door.

Kitchen~
A large brick fireplace dominates the kitchen, a large black pot hanging
over the ashes of the fire.  The worn old floor shows the scars of years
of use, and the counters are cluttered with the remains of half eaten
meals.  A small oval window looks out towards the back of another
building to the west.  An open doorway leads northward.

Smokey Den~
The scent of pipe-smoke hangs heavily in the air of this dark room. 
Thick cushioned couches and over-stuffed high back chairs sit in a
semi-circle, while little side-tables have been positioned almost
randomly about the room.  The floor is heavily carpeted, with several
intricately patterned rugs competing for attention.  A glowing gem hangs
in the midst of a crystal chandelier, its feeble light struggling against
the thickly decorated chamber.  Several ashtrays are heaped with ashes,
and several pipe cleaners sit in twisted heaps near each.  The windows
are covered with slatted wooden shutters.  An open doorway leads out to
the east.

Bedroom~
This room is a specimen of cleanliness, everything seems to be in its
place.  The bed is freshly made, and the white sheets are tucked in
tightly.  Fluffed pillows sit comfortably at the head of the bed, while a
folded woolen blanket sits at the foot.  Lace curtains hang in the open
windows, gently blowing in the breeze.  A soft carpet graces the floor,
cushioning your feet.  An oak door leads east and out of the room.

In the Lake~
The cold and deep blue water of the pond stretches out before you.  Just
to the south is a wooden pier, that you could probably climb onto.  To
the east and west steep banks and tangled willow trees prevent exit from
the lake.  To the north, the bank is sloped enough that you could easily
climb out of the pond and between the willows to that side.

Before a Grand Estate~
A massive and expensively decorated brick building rises high above you
to the west.  Wooden shutters grace the sides of the windows, while a
black-laquered set of double doors provides an entrance to the building. 
The building appears to be only two-stories high, but spreads out in a
gentle curve far to the north and south.  Well-trimmed hedges flank the
sides of the building, and between the windows taller junipers grow high
into the air.  A gravel path loops around a small fountain in front of
the building, eventually heading east down a tree-lined lane.

Inside the Entrance Hall~
The floor is a polished white marble veined with gold, and the walls
above the dark oak wainscot are covered in plush velvet.  A massive
chandelier of light-blue crystal hangs down from above, Huge gilded
mirrors hang from both sides of the hall, reflecting the light and
generally disorienting you.  A carved granite stairway curves gracefully
upwards, disappearing into the blinding light of the chandelier.  To the
west the entrance hall continues, and to the east a set of black double
doors exits the building.

Landing Above the Entrance Hall~
A thick red carpet covers much of the floor of the landing.  The walls
are sheathed in a layer of white marble topped with a running rail of
black granite.  Several carved busts sit on pedastals at the back of the
landing, staring with open eyes at all who ascend the stairs.  Portraits
dominate the wall facing the staircase, making the general feeling one of
being watched.  You can head down the massive staircase or head west
towards several doors in a hallway.

Upstairs Hallway - In Front of the Mirror~
Mounted on the west wall, and taking up almost the entire wall is a
massive gilded mirror.  The edges are beveled, and the frame is thick
wood inlayed with gold and carved into fanciful decoration.  The position
of the mirror seems to elongate the hall, as well as allowing you to see
yourself as you walk down the hallway.  To the north and south are two
dark oaken doors.  You can head towards the stairway to the east.

North Bedroom~
The stark white walls of the room stand out from beneath the heavy
tapestries that hang from the ceiling.  In the middle of the room is a
large canopy bed, covered by a dark shroud of thick black cloth.  Against
the east wall sits a wooden armoire, carved with intricate scenes of
pastoral bliss.  On each side of the bed are small windows that look
outside.  A heavy oak door leads south.
