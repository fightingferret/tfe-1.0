Narrow Ravine~
As you walk along this part of the ravine, you notice the walls have
become less steep, and covered with sparse brush.  This part of the
ravine acts as a funnel for the winds, making an eerie moaning noise. 
the ravine continues east and west, and a small path cuts north.

Path through Ravine~
Stumbling over a small dip in the path, you notice the sounds of falling
pebbles.  Looking up along the ravine you notice a faint path climbing up
the ravine wall to the south.  The wall to the north also seems
accessible.  As the air swirls about you in fits, a faint moaning can be
heard.

Path through Ravine~
The ravine is getting lower here and further east you can see it breaks
into an area of dense bushes and rocks.  To the south, a steep, rocky
slope rises above you, while the north wall is also very steep, and you
doubt you could make your way up it.  A very tall tree towers over you to
the southeast.

Ravine Wall~
You climb to this spot on the ravine wall, looking down on the ravine
itself.  The wind whips your clothing, stinging your eyes and drying
out your throat.  Pebbles, dislodged by your feet, bounce down into the
ravine.  The only way to go is east along the ravine wall, or south
back to the ravine.

Narrow Ravine outside Chiiron~
From this location you are presented with an excellent view of the
mountainous terrain of this region.  The village of Chiiron, directly to
the west, is set on the inside face of a mountain range surrounding a
large sea.  A heavy mist rolls in waves over the surface of the black
water, occasionally making visible a barge or merchantman crossing from
shore to shore.  Far to the southeast, majestic mountains pierce the dark
clouds encircling them, a path here cuts between two sheer rock faces,
sloping sharply down the hill to the east.  
~
This room is flagged no_mob for a purpose...to keep wandering mobs out of
Chiiron.

Path through Ravine~
You are in an area of large rocks and a few bushes.  To the west there is
a path which winds its way between two hills which rise up before you. 
The break which the path follows is worn through time but looks like it
was caused by some giant upheaval of the earth.  The path continues its
way south avoiding a large boulder.

Path Around a Large Boulder~
You are on a well travelled path between Chiiron and Medienne.  Right now
the path is curving around a large boulder which was carelessly placed
here eons ago.  The boulder is large but with a bit of skill you might
be able to clamber on top of it.  To the east you can see the sea far off
in the distance and the path slowly winding its way towards it.  The
other end of the path heads north.

Mountain Path~
As the wind crosses the path, it carries a strong scent of wild sage with
it.  Heavy pollen fills the air, and swirls about you like a thin blanket
on an autumn evening.  Signs of life are everywhere, with a variety of
animal tracks littering the path.  More of this can be seen to the north
and west.

You stand on top of a very large boulder.  The rock underfoot is almost

around, you can see for miles in all directions.  On all sides, hills
rise up toward the horizon, and in the distance to the west you spy the
walls of Chiiron.

Mountain Path~
A soft breeze can be heard overhead as the wind crosses the high boulders
lining the path.  Dirt from the trail swirls in tiny eddies with every
gust, each time further obscuring the tracks of various sorts along this
path.  Travel is possible up the hill to the west and downward to the
east.

animal track into the brush, and to the west the path continues up the
hill.

Brush, North Ridge~
From this vantage point you can see north to the mountains and below you
a valley of brush and scrub.  The track continues to the north down into
the valley and south back to the main trail.  The track is quite steep
and narrow.  The ridge-side is covered in brush, and thorns, you would
not want to fall in this area.

Break in the Path~

south, showing tracks from many of the local fauna.  The main path
continues to the east, where the faint sound of waves on a shore can be
heard.

Filling each horizon are the mountains which define this region.  While
considerably lower to the south, they are by no means small.  To the
east, down the hill, it is possible to glimpse the the black waters of
the Northern Sea, although it is not close enough to witness any detail. 
Continuing to the west leads further up the mountainside.

An Animal Track~
A tight path cuts through the brush here in what is unmistakably an
animal track.  The irregularity of the trail surface shows the heavy
scars of hoofprints, at points cutting into the thick network of roots
beneath the topsoil.  A broader path is visible to the north, while the
track continues into the brush to the south.

Beneath the Swami's Platform~
The animal trail you have been following peters out here with no where
else to go.  To the south is a cliff, while north of here the ground
rises up a rocky slope.  A thick wall of brambles to the west renders
progress in that direction difficult.

A small platform is balanced upon a tall wooden pole here.

Brush~
Here the track has dropped away from the ridge which still runs
north-south over away to the east.  The brush has opened up a little and
here and there is the odd balsa tree or bush of sage.  The ground is
still quite rocky and many small rocks litter the ground all around.  One
rock catches your eye though because sticking out from underneath it is
the top of a small leather pouch.  A stream crosses the path to the
north, possibly deep enough to cause problems for armor clad adventurers.

The track drops below the ridge edge on the west side of the ridge and
continues down to the north.  Here and there, there are the odd set of
tracks now that the ground has more soil.  Against the east side of the
track at one point there are some bushes that seem to have a quite dark
patch of rock behind them.

Small Clearing~
The trail opens into a small clearing here of approximately 20 meters in

throughout the rest of the brush, and is laced with the pungent odor of
excrement.  A thick swelling of dark green foliage is in the southwest
section of this clearing.  To the south, a huge boulder looms over the
area, part of a rocky ridge which seems to run roughly east to west.
A small rickety shack stands off to the west, dug into the side of a hill.

The track meanders along northwards until it meets a stream which runs

stream and occasional splash of a fish.

Top of the Large Balsa Tree~
You are at the top of the balsa tree.  You can see for miles in every
direction.  Chiiron lies to the west and far to the east you can make out
the ocean.

Inside the Balsa Tree~
You are inside the balsa tree.  Something or someone has carefully
scraped out the inside of the tree to make a very comfortable room.  The
only problem with it is the very strong animal stench which makes being
in here rather unpleasant.  In one corner is a pile of odds and ends
which the owner of this cave seems to have collected.

Narrow Ravine~
Steep rocky walls rise above you to the east and west, while dense
underbrush crowds the area underfoot.  To the north, the ground rises up
a rocky slope.  To the east, you spy an open area with bushes, with a
great tree towering over the entire area.

Rocky Slope~
The ground here is steep and uneven, as it slopes steeply downward to the
south and back toward the brush.  At the foot of a steep drop to the
north, you spy a narrow trail leading east and west.  A huge tree towers
over you to the east, and above a rock wall to the west dense bushes and
undergrowth prevents passage.

Rickety Shack~
The interior of this shack is in shambles.  The wooden boards which
comprise its walls lean this way and that, threatening at any moment to
come tumbling down upon your head.  A simple pile of straw sits off in
one corner, while a few wooden benches and ratty blankets make up the
remainder of the room's furnishings.

Brambles~
Thick brambles and brush cover this hillside.  Wherever the brush does not
grow, it seems that a large boulder or steep slope is - making movement
here slow and difficult.  To the east, you think you see an open area
through some brambles, and to the west a small opening offers passage
near the bottom of a hill.

Dry Rocky Hills~
A few clumps of thick brown bushes grow here, but you are able to move
freely through the grassy areas between them.  The surrounding terrain is
hilly, with rocky rises to the north and south of you.

Dry Rocky Hills~
You stand on a steep, dry hilly slope.  To the north and south, the
ground rises steeply, the unforgiving inclines covered with scores of
rocks, large and small.  You can see the walls of Chiiron off in the
distance to the west.

Brush~
The brush here is thick, with many bushes growing along the rocky slopes. 
To the north, a rough outcropping towers above you, in the direction of
the road, while west of here you spy an animal track.  To the south, the
ground rises towards a small hilltop.
