Cave Entrance~
A thin, rocky ledge stretches north to south through this yawning cave. 
Most of the cave's surfaces are too slippery or precarious to walk on. 
Judging from the amount of detritus littered around the cave, it use to
be heavily occupied once.  But now, you see little evidence of current
dwellers.  To the south, at the cave's mouth, you can see a large,
cascading waterfall.  The cave widens to the north, where the floor
becomes less slippery.

Cave Tunnel~
A long, steep tunnel descends north, further under the mountain.  The
temperature of the cavern is much cooler than you are accustomed to.  To
the south, you can see a faint illumination outlining the edges of an
opening.  Beads of moisture run down the side walls of the limestone
cavern.

Passageway~
You can almost feel the weight of the mountain above pressing down upon
you with its immensity.  The passageway runs from east to west over a
level limestone floor.  Stalagmites formed from dripping sediment rise
from the ground like the teeth of a cavern fish.  A small accumulation of
luminescent fungus clings to the northern wall of the passageway, casting
the shadows of the stalagmites onto the south wall.

Cave Tunnel~
The cavern here is much wider than the passageway that lies to the south. 
Thick, heavy stalagmites rise from the ground, creeping around the edges
of a small, milky pool of liquid.  Flecks of shiny minerals can be seen
embedded in the floor and the eastern wall appears to have several
mineral deposits in it.  To the far south, you can see a miniscule amount
of light streaming through a cave opening.  The passageway continues to
head north at a steep angle while to the west it branches along a more
even path.

Picture Room~
The walls of this particular cavern are lined with murals depicting
various forms of community life within the caves.  Drab hues of brown and
gray adorn the granite wall surfaces, with an occasional patch of white
made visible by the flickering light you provide.  The cave passages form
an intersection here, continuing from east to west and upward to the
south.  A single torch burning a foul-smelling substance illuminates the
immediate area.

Natural Spring~
A strange number of non-thallophytic plants grow along the edges of the
dirt-covered cavern floor.  Among them are numberous pothos vines as well
as dark creepers.  The flora within the limestone cavern grows along the
edges of a small, crystal-clear spring.  The cavern continues to the
north and east.

Nature's Cavern~
This limestone cavern is very large and spacious.  The walls are lined
with numerous paintings drawn in chalk and depict things such as animals
and plants.  Piles of wood, long since petrified, lie stacked on the
floor within ancient fire pits.  Bat guano litters the floor in large
heaps.  Clearly, bats have been living within the cavern for quite some
time.  The cavern extends to the west, south, and east.

Nature's Cavern~
Simple etchings on the north wall show pictographic representations of
various local fauna, including the cave bat and some form of rodentia. 
Dark brown marks, quite possibly blood, stain the areas within and
immediately surrounding the etchings, perhaps there as talismen to ward
or warn of these creatures.  To both the east and west of this cavern are
small passageways that you might be able to enter.

Cave Dweller's Living Area~
The warmth of kindred family spirits seems to surround you as you enter
what is obviously the living area of the cave dwellers.  Oil stains line
the walls from torches dipped in animal fat and rocks litter the floor
partitioning the sleeping areas.  Still there is the pervading feeling of
fear and mystery as you wonder what lies ahead in the passages and
rooms.

Nature's Cavern~
As you step into this room, you cannot help to shiver and a prickly
feeling to go up and down your spine.  The walls of the cavern undulate
in such a way as to create many shadows which jump and dance startlingly
when you move.

The natural coolness of the cave has a new bone chilling feeling here. 
Scattered about the room are the bones of animals who have come here
to die.  There is only uneasiness in this room, the feeling of spirits
not at rest.  The only escape from this room of bones is back the way
you came.

The Medicine Man's Room~
Unlike the rough, natural cavern to the east, this cavern looks to be
more of a modified chamber.  Its walls have been smoothed somewhat and
are graced by numerous paintings.  There is an air of respect however
around the chamber that is hard to place.  A stone slab lies in the
center of the room and looks very much like a funeral bier.  To the
north, beyond this structured chamber, lies yet more cavern.

Nature's Cavern~
Crude indentations have been dug into the walls on both the west and east

the still forms of decaying corpses veiled thinly by cobwebs and dust. 
To either side of each funerary niche there are places to jam torches
into the walls, to illuminate the alcoves.  The limestone cavern
continues north to south along a level floor.

Ancient Burial Grounds~
This limestone chamber appears to be a burial ground of sorts.  Numerous
funerary niches line the walls.  Along with the niches, several stone
biers fill the chamber along with a large number of graves.  Many of the
older graves have been dug up and the bones within scattered about the
room.  Painted along the walls and biers are faded pictures depicting
warriors, animals, and battle.

The walls of the cavern about you seem to radiate a sort of natural
light.  Large stalactites hang from the ceiling, and likewise,
stalagmites protrude from the floor.  To the south you can see the floor
is severely scraped.  It is quite obvious that the south wall swings out
somehow.  You expect from the marks on it that it just requires a good
push.

Glowing Passageway~
Fallen rocks adorn the ground here, perhaps victims of gravity. 
A phosphorescent lichen emits a faint green glow from the walls, but not
nearly enough to illuminate the room or its contents.  The passage

north.

This chamber is at the base of a very long, vertical passageway.  While
it is difficult from this vantage point to determine the exact height of
this tunnel, it is apparent that the most adroit of spelunkers would
attempt such a journey.  Heavy cast iron rungs are set into the wall of
the passageway providing some assistance in traversing the otherwise
sheer face of the bedrock.  The caverns continue at a significantly more
reasonable angle to the south and east of here.

Large Cavern~
You have just entered a large cavern hewn out of solid stone.  Large
stalactites hang from the ceiling with water dripping off them.  The drops
of water land on the equally large stalagmites.  There must be some
volcanic activity nearby, as the floor of the room is quite hot, with
steam rising from the shallow pools of water.
