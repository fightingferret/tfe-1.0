Forest of Medienne~
The way seems almost clear here, allowing you to freely go east and south. 
To the west the forest juts up against steep rock walls, with no handhold
or footholds to speak of.  The trees have thinned down to almost nothing
here as the forest canopy dissolves into choppy bits of sky.  To the north
the forest appears to thin out just a bit.

Forest of Medienne~
You stumble a little as you walk along this pathless ground; thick
undergrowth at your feet compounds the problem.  The forest continues in
all directions from here, although it seems the undergrowth thickens
drastically to the west.  Undergrowth too thick to penetrate lies to the
south.  A thick layer of leaves covers the ground, causing a loud stir
with every step.

Forest Trail~
Walking further into the forest, the trees crowd closer and grow higher;
the sky cannot be seen clearly from beneath the tree canopy.  Brambles
have pulled away from the east and west.  The sounds of the forest seem
muted here.  You stand on a trail that continues to the east and west,
while the undergrowth is thick to the north and south.

Moaning Woods~
The trees here appear dead, bark molting away from the white wood like
diseased skin.  The wind here has intensified, swirling around you, 
blowing in from the west and flowing south.  The ground here looks dry
and crumbly, you kick up clods of it at every step.  The moaning has
increased with the wind, almost too loud now.  The forest continues
west and south.

Shrieking Woods~
You have reached a closed in area of of the forest.  All around you the 
dead trees rear up, reaching out with their skeletal branches, aching
to seize you, or so it seems.  The moaning has escalated to a shrieking
that threatens to tear out your ears.  The moaning sound definitely
comes from this area, centering on a small hole in the crumbly ground.
The only exit is to the north.

The normal sounds of the forest seem to have been cut off, as if by

Bone Clearing~
The forest has opened up into a small clearing, hung with the bones of
hundreds of small animals.  The trees appear to be made of bones too,
standing tall and gaunt.  In the center of the clearing is an altar,
built of large animal bones.  A feeling of great evil oozes from the 
altar.  The blood of hundreds of animals has soaked into the forest
floor, crusting it in red.  Old bones poke from the dirt at almost
regular intervals.

Forest of Medienne~
Large oak and elm trees surround the area, dense enough to prevent any
extensive undergrowth.  Many acorns lie on the ground here, partially
eaten by the chipmunks and squirrels.  A thick, soft bed of leaves lies
under the trees, looking quite inviting.

The oaks and maples reach high into the air, blocking off your view of
the sky.  A wide, slowly moving river flows by a bit south of here,
carrying dead leaves and other assorted debris along in its current.  The
riverbank here is not very steep, and this seems to be a very highly
travelled area for the animals.  The muddy ground is covered in animal
tracks, and several trees have been chewed down by beavers.  The forest
grows much more densely to the east and north, blocking progress in those

Forest of Medienne~
The trees here are splintered and covered in burn marks by some fire that
swept through the forest not too long ago.  Small vines wrap around the
charred trees and work their way up their skeletal branches.  Bits and
pieces of stone debris litter the forest floor beneath you from a
structure which once possibly stood here.  Knee-high grass covers this
portion of the forest, slowly wavering as a breeze passes through the
woods.  There is evidence of more fire damage to the south, east, and
west; in fact, the undergrowth has grown back so thick that it blocks
progress to the west.

The forest here seems to have been even more badly damaged than the
charred section of forest to the north.  Dense vines and other
undergrowth have sprung up quickly in the absence of any light-blocking
trees; the brush clogs the ground at your feet here.  Further fire damage
is evident to the west and south, although the brush has grown back too
thick in those directions to allow movement.  Small amounts of stone
debris are visible here, and in larger amounts to the north.  A trail is
visible winding its way through the trees off to the east.

Tall, healthy maples cover the area, leaning out over the wide-flowing
river to the south.  A medium-sized maple has fallen into the river to
the south, branches protruding above the smooth surface of the water. 
Soft, dark green clumps of grass grow along the riverbank here.  The

be seen where the grass grows sparsely.  A very large, dead maple tree
has fallen just north of here, blocking any progress in that direction.

Despite the fact that the forest is less dense here than in all other
directions, the underbrush is still surprisingly thin.  A thick carpet of
dry, dead leaves covers the ground here, crunching underfoot as you walk. 
Off to the west and south, a trail can be seen winding through the trees,
while the forest continues in all other directions.  To the north, an

This part of the forest seems to open out, allowing you a better look at

The maples that dominate this area tower over the slow-moving river which
flows just south of where you stand.  It appears that the beavers that
live somewhere nearby have selected this as their foraging ground, for
several trees have been gnawed through, leaving only pointed stumps. 
Although the trees grow almost up to the riverbank here, a few hardy
weeds have grown up along the sloping mud.  The riverbanks are steep and
sloping here, although it would be easy to slide down them into the river
below.

Forest of Medienne - Base of a Large Elm~
Above you looms a very large elm tree; low branches appear to provide
solid hand and foot-holds for a safe climb.  The grass near the base of
the tree is almost dead, doubtless because of the shade made by the leafy
boughs of the tree.  Mountains rise in the distance to the north,
although the trees grow too thick to travel in that direction.

Forest of Medienne - Grassy Clearing~
The trees have grown back to the south, leaving this area covered in
yellow, waist-high grass.  Patches of waist-high clumps of purplish
blossoms grow, mixing in with the grass.  The grass grows much shorter to
the east and west, while to the north a huge elm tree towers.  The forest
continues to the south.

Majestic oaks tower above you here, blocking out most of the light from

leaves, as if this area sees a lot of traffic.  Hundreds of acorn shells
lie strewn about; it appears most of the acorns have been eaten already. 
Off to the south, the ground slopes downward and becomes thick with mud,

Forest of Medienne~
This area of the forest is higher, more hard-packed ground than the boggy
area to the east; a small depression to the north also contains pools of
standing water, preventing movement in that direction.  The trees in this
area are far more healthy than the dying trees visible to the west, while
the forest becomes even thicker to the south.  The underbrush in this
area is very thin, as apparently the hard-packed earth makes it difficult
for the brush to survive.

Forest of Medienne - Before a Large Oak Tree~
Obviously a center of life for this area, an ancient oak tree sways
gently with the wind.  Huge, gnarled limbs stretch well over fifty feet
into the sky high above.  A hole the size of a man's head is visible in
the trunk of the tree, about five feet off the ground.  Dead leaves and
acorns litter the ground at your feet; a distinct lack of underbrush in
the area makes them easy to see.  A patch of oddly-leaved plants with
small, sharp nettles lies just to the south, while the forest continues
in all other directions.

The trees here grow more sparsely and look to be younger than the larger,
denser oaks and maples found north and east of here.  The fallen leaves
here are eaten through in places, and after a moment it is easy to
realize why: swarms of small, flying bugs hover overhead and can be seen
crawling through the dead leaves at your feet.  A trail can be seen
winding through the trees from north to east, while to the west and south
the forest continues.

Forest Trail~
The forest in this region seems less healthy than in all directions,
although the reason for this is not quite clear.  The faint trail heads
almost straight east to west here, covered with weeds and a covering of
leaves from the dying trees above.  An area of dense underbrush is
visible off to the south, where the forest appears much more healthy.

Forest of Medienne - Dense Undergrowth~
It is almost impossible to navigate through this area; in fact, you are
forced to crawl through brambles and over vines to find your way through
here at all.  The trees grow close together here, and the few glimpses
you can get of them reveal that they appear to be healthy oaks and maples. 
It is impossible to make out the ground below the dense green undergrowth
at your feet.  Any view of what may lie in any direction from here is
blocked out by the dense vegetation.

The trees, mostly great oaks and elms, grow tall in this area, blocking

darker than even the dense forest to the north, while in all other

Forest Trail Split~
Here the trail splits; more well-travelled sections of the trail lie to
the east and west, while to the south the trail seems much fainter.  The
forest here is wide and open, allowing light from far above down to the
forest floor.  This section of the forest, obviously more travelled than
most, is covered with wagon tracks, boot prints, and other marks too
scuffed to be identified.

A rickety, rotting wooden @Rsign@n has been posted here.

Forest Trail~
The forest closes in much closer to the trail than to the north and
south; trees push you in from the west and east.  Primarily
healthy-looking oaks make up this section of the forest, with a few
birches visible on the east side of the trail.  The trail here appears to
be an area of infrequent traffic, and is overgrown in places with weeds
and covered in dead leaves.  It continues to wind through the trees off
to the north and south, where the forest becomes a bit more open.

Forest of Medienne - Boggy Ground~
A few depressions filled with muddy, murky water are visible around the
area.  Large bear tracks can be seen here, covering the muddy,
leaf-covered ground.  The trees are less dense than to the north and
west, but it is still difficult to see the sky high above through the
dense canopy.  The healthy oaks and maples of the area continue off to
the north and west through the boggy ground, while to the south and east
the forest thins.

Forest of Medienne~
This dark, dense section of the forest is dominated by primarily huge,
towering oaks and elms.  The thick canopy far above blocks out most of
the light; tall, dark green weeds grow all around this area.  Far through
the thinning forest to the east, an occasional glint of water can be seen. 
The forest thins off to the south and north; off to the north the ground
slopes down and becomes boggy.

Forest of Medienne - Birch Grove~
This area is slightly lower than the ground in all other directions, and
dominated by many tall, aged birch trees.  Dead leaves cover the ground
thickly here, crunching underfoot with every step.  Strewn about over the
leaves are sheets of peeling birch bark, obviously having come from the
number of birches in this region.  The birch grove continues off to the
south, while the darker trunks of oaks and elms can be seen far to the
north.

The forest stretches in all directions from here; with no landmarks in
any direction it would be quite easy to get lost in this expanse of
forest.  Thin underbrush in this area allows you to see the thick carpet
of dead leaves underfoot.  A faint glimmer of water can be seen through
the trees far to the east.

Forest of Medienne~
A wide, clear river flows by just to the south of where you stand.  The
large, leafy maples in this area grow very close to the edge of the river. 
The ground is littered with dead leaves and covered in sticky mud,
revealing that the river washes over the low banks frequently.  A few
reed-like, stalked plants struggle in the mud here.

Forest of Medienne~
You stand at a transition point in the forest: to the west the forest is
mostly oaks and elms, while to the east lies a fast-moving river, and
across that, you see the tops of fir and pine trees.  The ground at your
feet has few leaves, allowing you to see the rocky ground and hard-packed
dirt below.  To the north, the cliffs of the Dragonspires begin, while to
the south and west the forest continues.

The trees are sparse at this part of the forest; light shines through the

The river to the east is visible a few feet below you, racing through a
stretch of rapids.  The riverbank is very steep here, covered in slick
mud and small, rounded stones.  Few trees grow right up to the riverbank,
but a few pointed stumps at the riverbank indicate that a beaver has been
at work in this area.  A peaceful-looking clearing is visible off to the
south, while the forest becomes much more dense off to the west.

Forest of Medienne - Small Clearing~
Lush, six-inch grass grows a deep green across this peaceful forest
clearing.  The trees seem to surround this area protectively, sheltering
it from the wind and weather.  On the south side of the clearing is a
small well, lined with a circle of small, rounded stones.  Another pile
of stones has been arranged on the north side of the clearing; small
flowers and other offerings at its base give the impression that it is an
altar of some sort.  The river rages by just east of this area, while the
forest thickens off to the west.  The riverbank continues both north and

Forest Trail~
You have come upon a rushing river, cutting off movement to the east. 
The trees here do not grow up to the water, giving you a look at the sky
where the canopy of the forest ends.  The sound of the river is a
rolling, rushing purr here.  To the north, the forest continues, and the
trail curves south and west here.

The trail here parallels the river, winding and twisting like the rushing

You are walking along a slightly muddy trail that parallels a river to

in the canopy above.  The river makes a rushing, rambling, gasping sound,
pleasant to listen to.  The trail continues both north and south, and the
forest meanders to the west.  Along the trail to the south you can see a
shiny new bridge.

trail ground~
The trail here follows the river, with all of its twists and turns, and
it is fairly muddy, making for a slippery time.  The trail goes both
north and south.
~
E
tree trees forest~
The forest here has pulled back from the river.  The trees that you do
see are all healthy and vigorous.  Very little undergrowth grows here,
probably because the trail is close to the water and between the river
and the forest.
~
E
river water 1 east~
The river here appears to be flowing by at a good clip, making you
slightly dizzy to look at it.  Large rocks sit just under the surface,
ready and waiting for unsuspecting boatists to meet them in a 
splintering, crashing way.
~
E

Here the forest canopy stops short of the river, causing a gap of about
50 feet.  Some of the smaller animals of the forest (those that live in
the tree-tops) seem to be confused by this cessation of the foliage.

Forest Trail~
The trail you have been following twists here, heading north and towards
a shiny new bridge to the east.  The forest has crept closer to the path
on the southern and western sides, preventing you from going in those
directions.  The trees themselves appear to be remarkably healthy,
probably because of all of the nearby water.

The trail here goes right up to the bridge, almost invitingly.  The way
is slightly muddy, caused by the river, no doubt.  The forest grows 
right up to the edge of the trail here.

The forest has crept up on the trail, leaning over protectively.  The
trees to the south and west have gathered together so close as to keep
you from going in those directions.  The trees here all appear to be
in the best of health, their bright green leaves and crinkled bark all
proclaiming the forest to be in the prime of its life.

The bridge to the east appears to be a recent addition, the freshly
quarried rock gleams under the open sky.  The trail goes up onto the
bridge, and seems to continue onto the other side.  The bridge is made
of stone, joined together with very little mortar.  Pilings are sunk
into the earth on either side of the trail, anchoring the bridge to 
the shore.

Forest of Medienne - Old Trail~
The faint path curves from west to south here, almost lost among the
weeds and dead leaves that cover the ground in this area.  A rock
riverbank overlooks the rushing river visible just east of here, and
could probably be slid down into the river quite easily.  The tall
birches and maples of this area seem especially healthy, perhaps due to
the abundance of water.  An especially dense clump of trees grows just to
the north, while a large clutter of debris can be seen off to the south.

The forest thins here as it approaches the river to the east. The
ground is elevated slightly here, offering a better view of the
surrounding forest.  To the east lies a pile of rotting timbers and

To the west you see a rushing river, whirling and tumbling around over
the rocks.  The forest here grows right up to the water, shading the
water with their boughs.  The trees to the north grow very close
together, so close that you cannot see a way through.  You can travel
through the trees to the east and south.

You have come upon the bank of a fast flowing river.  To the west you see
the brown waters rushing by very fast.  The trees grow right up to the
banks of the river, some even leaning out over the waters.  The sound of
the water is very soothing.  The forest blocks you in to the east, you
can travel parallel to the river by walking north or south.

Forest Trail~
You have reached the eastern shore of a river.  A shiny new bridge
crosses it to the west.  A trail coming off of the bridge continues
east and west, and the forest goes off to the north.  The trees on this
side of the river appear to be in very good shape, healthy and green.
The trees here grow close to the river, allowing little sky to show
through.

Forest of Medienne - Collapsed Bridge~
To the west you see a rushing river, rolling and tumbling over the rocks
in its way.  What looks like a washed out bridge goes partway across but,
just stops, torn planks and ropes showing where the power of the river
destroyed the rest.  The forest was cut back here from the river, leaving
a wide open spot.  The forest goes to the north and east here, the river
is to the west, and to the south you can see closly packed trees.

You have reached what would be the east bank of a fast-flowing river,
except for the fact that the trees have grown right up in the water
here.  The path has become muddy, it seems the river has recently
flooded, jumping its banks and drowning the trees and part of the path.
The path has become very faint here, but it seems to follow around the

Forest Trail~
The trail has taken you deep into the forest, and trees bend over the
path.  The undergrowth has taken on an odd cast, seemingly more and more
dense.  The forest goes to the north and south, while the trail heads off
to the east and west.  To the west you can hear the sound of a rushing
river.

Forest of Medienne~
As you inhale the smell of this forest, you get a sense of quiet and
peace, at least until the forest canopy bursts into furious noise.  The
trees to the east and west have gathered in and will not allow you to
move in those directions.  To the north you see a trail, and to the 
south the forest continues.  To the west you can hear the sounds of

You walk along the border between the end of the forest and the shear
wall that marks the beginnings of the mountains.  To the north the trees
are a solid wall of foliage, while to the south you can see just a rock
wall.  This hidden part of the forest continues to the east and west.

Forest Trail~
Here the trail has begun to curve, like a spastic snake.  It dodges all
around the trees, under branches, between trunks, and among the small
bushes.  The forest undergrowth appears to be growing well here, with
many small plants and bushes scattered around.  The trail winds its way
north and south.

The forest here has become warped and twisted, limbs bent and off-center
hang off all of the trees.  The smell is almost too much, making you
gag and choke just from standing here.  The trees and animals all have
almost identical open sores and visible wounds.  This grotesque forest

A Rushing River~
You are swimming in the middle of a rushing river.  Great rocks surround
you at this part of the river, apparently long ago having made the long
journey from the towering cliffs to the north.  The water moves quickly
here and the river is narrow, still containing much of the energy from
its long fall from the mountains.  Clear and free of debris, the cold
mountain water flows onward to the south.  Far in the north rise the high
peaks of the Dragonspires, while to the west and east the forest
continues.

Slowly-Moving River - Beaver Dam~
You are swimming in an extremely wide section of the river.  The reason
for this wide section of slower-moving river is easy to see: a huge
beaver dam, constructed of logs, twigs, and mud has been constructed at a
bend in the river here.  Over the dam to the south, the river continues,
but the slickness of the dam and thick overhanging tree growth makes it
impossible to follow the river any further in that direction.  A steep,
slick riverbank rises west of here.

protrude through the smooth surface of the river.

A large tree, its trunk almost four feet thick, has fallen into the river

A Wide River~
The river twists a bit here as it snakes on to the west, current moving
slowly along as it flows on its downstream course.  Muddy and shallow in
places, the river seems to have some sort of activity under its surface,
but it is too murky to make out.  The low, sloped riverbanks would make
it easy to leave the river at this point.

This stretch of the river is very wide; gently sloping riverbanks slick

narrow.  The current is slow here, as the river bends from south to west. 
Below your feet, the bottom has slipped away from sight, either because
the water is too murky to peer through or because it is simply too deep.

Moaning Forest~
As you walk to this part of the forest, you begin to notice a wind,
coming from the north.  The sound has increased dramatically and seems
to undulate with the wind.  The trees have become taller still, and more
skeletal.  The forest continues north and south from here.

You stumble slightly on a raised part of the forest floor.  Looking

sound has increased, sending chills down your spine.  The trees 
themselves appear to have grown up twisted and bare, almost bonelike.
The forest continues to the north and south.

of evil emanating from this part of the tree.  You may exit to the south.

clamps have been driven straight into the stone.  From these clamps,
large chains restrict the movement of large dogs, growling and snarling
in your general direction.  There are exits in the rock to the east and
south, and a small hole to the east.

Dark Cave~
You stand in a small natural cavern.  Looking about, you notice that it
has apparently been used for many years by passing animals and beasts,
many blood stains and claw marks which scar the walls and floor.  To the

Dark Cave~
This dark, damp tunnel is hewn out of the living rock surrounding this
place.  The rough carved walls seem to have been cut with primitive
mining equipment.  The floor of the tunnel has been angled down to form a
gutter of sorts to channel the flowing sewage.

Large Cavern~
In this large cavern dwells the majority of the various clan.  This is
where they rest, divide up loot and play with slaves.  In the center of
the room is a large bonfire pit, the flames from the fire reach nearly to
the ceiling.  To the west is another cave leading into the darkness. 
Hanging about this cavern are large war banners for the various bands
that are represented in this raiding party.  Hanging in the center of the
southern wall is a huge tapestry.

By the looks of this small alcove, it appears to be some sort of command
center.  Many chests have been stacked precariously near the northern
wall, they look as though they could fall at any time.  A pile of straw
in the corner serves as a sleeping mat for the leader of this rag-tag
band of raiders.  The ground is littered with chunks of bone and decaying
meat.  One particular part of the floor seems to be clear of all debris
however.

Shaman's Lair~
Peering about this caved-in tunnel you see many idols of demons and
demi-gods perched in every nook and cranny, while the northern cave-in
part supplies a perfect place for an altar.  Carved into a smooth part of
the rocky floor is a large circle of glowing pigments.  Placed in the
center of the circle lies a corpse.

Carved into the living rock of the cave floor is a circle of power.  It's
