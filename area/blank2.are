Fork in the Trail~
You have reached a fork in the trail.  To the north, the path begins to
climb and off in the distance you can see a small watch tower.  To the
east the path drops sharply winding its way down a small cliff to what
looks like a beach below.  To the west the path is fairly level and leads
off into the hillside.

Western Sea Trail~
The marked trail continues on to the north and south.  To the south you
see what appears to be a fork in the trail.  Wind blows in from the sea
to the east covering your face with drops of salty water.

Western Sea Trail~
The trail here is muddy and you can see tracks heading north and south. 
Your footwear soon becomes splattered with mud as you continue on along
the trail.  To the east you can hear the cries of sea gulls and other
birds of the sea.

Ahead the trail curves right while to the south you see what appears to

crashing against the shore below.  From what you can see this trail is
not too far from the beach off to the east.

Bushes along the side of the path rustle as wind blows in from the
south.  Thoughts of an ambush from cut-throats and brigands trouble you
as you walk along the trail.  The trail takes a turn to the north further
ahead.

You can see tracks in the ground made by wheelbarrows and many feet.  It

Occasionally you can see an albatross circling lazily in the sky.  The
trail leads to the north and south.

Beneath a Square Stone Tower~
You stand at the foot of a stone tower.  Its thick walls covered with ivy
and moss, the structure is apparently quite old and, judging from the
pock marks gouged into the tower's base, seen many a battle.  To the
east, a small dirt path leads back toward the main trail, while a short
distance away from the cleared area near the tower's base, a low curtain
of brush creeps out toward you.

On a Large Sand Dune Overlooking the Beach~
Under your feet is a mass of soft sand which shifts as you readjust your
feet.  The pale yellow sand is fine, and has bits of grass and twigs
interspersed.  As you look east you can see sand below you leading to to
the sea.  To your north you can see a large rock and firm land; south
lies more of this large dune.

Western Sea Trail~
The thunderous crash of waves to the east echos loudly up the side of the
near vertical cliff.  The various trails converging here make a form of a
T intersection with paths leading north, south and west.  Trees lining
the paths stretch peacefully into the sky as well as provide some shade
for the lonely traveler.

On a Large Sand Dune Overlooking the Beach~
You find yourself on a huge sand dune which stretches north and south as
far as your eyes can see.  To your west you can see trails leading
towards Chiiron, but the sand is too soft to tread upon.  To your east
you can see the beach, but the sand is so fine, you cannot safely walk
upon it.

Before a Large Sandy Cliff Face~
Just above you stands a tall sandstone cliff, its pale face marked with
easy handholds.  To the north extends a large sand dune which looks just
solid enough to hold your weight.  Rising up to the south is a sheer
cliff wall composed of hardened sandstone.  Eastwards extends a narrow,
sandy path which leads to the beach.

Northern Sea trail - Cliff Overlooking the Sea of Stars~
The trail climbs up a steep cliff here, allowing you an amazing view of
the vast Sea of Stars to the south.  The clear blue water of the sea laps
gently against the shore below and as the light strikes different
portions of it you can see a light twinkling effect, hence why it is
called the Sea of Stars.  The trail descends down the cliff a few feet to
the west from here while to the east it continues to climb the steep
cliff.

Northern Sea Trail~
The well-worn mountain trail leads to the west and south.  Off in the
distance to the south you hear the rhythmic sound of waves crashing, and
above you fly many different varieties of sea birds.  This small road is
not one of the safest places apparently as there are frequent reports of
highway men and rogues.  Even the semi-frequent patrols of guards can't
keep it safe.  To the north, a small road disappears from view behind a
screen of bushes.

A small sign is posted here.

Small Winding Path~
This narrow trail is really just a bit of sand covering sparse grass.  It
must be used only by pedestrians, it is too narrow for large animals or
wagons.  It is very worn with use; the actual trail is a foot below the
normal ground level.

The well-worn mountain road leads to the east and north here.  About 150

its large waves.  It appears that the whole sea is covered in a fine
mist, and the water is so dark that no light penetrates it.

Northern Sea Trail~
The mountain road continues to the east and west here.  To the north
there are densely wooded mountains, and to the south you hear the waves
of the Northern Sea.  This road is known for the often poor visibility,
that is caused by the fog that rolls in up the valley.  You notice as you
walk that everyone you pass is all bundled up and looking away from you.

ship's horn, or get a glimpse of a ship through the dark mist.  To the

distance to the south you can hear the rhythmic tumbling of waves
crashing on a beach.  Off in the distance to the west you see a guard
tower, with a large bell mounted at the top.  The bell is used for
warning the guards of Chiiron and Medienne in case of attack from the

Northern Sea Trail~
Here the path bends to the north around a small inlet and the path here
looks well-worn with signs of heavy commercial use.  Below a cliff drops
away toward the Northern Sea, and just from this vantage point, you can
see the top of a tower down there.  A faint trail winds its way down to
the west.

You are a well-worn path that heads east and west.  This is the path that

overhead, while to the south the terrain drops until a cliff plunges the
rest of the way into the Great Northern Sea.

mountains rise up out of the foothills.  You notice that everyone who
passes by is totally bundled up and are looking down with their faces
covered.  Even the guards that frequent the area can't keep the road too
safe.

prints in the mud.  A small trail branches off to the east and heads into
a dense forest.

Trail Around Medienne~
The dirt path heads west and north, turning and following a bump-out in

from the scarred stone walls.  Many footprints and wheel-marks show that
this dusty trail is well travelled.

with it the scent of the salt water below.  To the east the trail becomes
rocky as it continues to make its climb up the cliff and around the edges
of the sea.  To the west it begins to descend a bit as it heads down

Large smooth boulders lie scattered about the trail here, nearly blocking

border the trail break through the hard ground here as time has eroded
most of the soil away.  Looking over the edge you notice that several
trees lie at the rocky shore below as the cliff has slowly been eaten
away by erosion.  The trail continues its course around the edge of the
sea to the east and west from here.

edge of the trail lean at a steep angle over the cliff, as if at any
moment their roots could break and send them tumbling to the water below. 
A few miles to the southeast you can see the city of Medienne sitting
just on the outskirts of the forest.  Far off the southwest the city of
Chiiron appears as a mere speck as the landscape.

the edge of the cliff.  Just barely visible at least fifty miles to the

The sound of the massive waves of the Sea of Stars crashing against the

with ease.  Sitting against the northern edge of the trail are two small
wagons filled with road working equipment ranging from shovels to hefty
pick-axes.  Along the southern edge of the trail a small, makeshift stone
wall has been built.  The trail continues seemingly for miles to the east
and west from here.

Suspension Bridge~
The bridge starts swaying to and fro as heavy winds howl below.  Ahead
you see a few planks missing leaving a gap of about 10 feet.  Looks like
you need to jump for it if you wish to travel further east.  At the
bottom of the chasm you see what looks like a smashed up cart.  Looking
north, you see the road climb with the edge of the chasm to circle around
the long way.  
~
[Seltha] This gap is just way to impossible :)  For starters, it's got eagle eye cafe in the middle of it, and secondly, it must be about a kilometer wide, going by the looks of the cliff face now :)
[Seltha] My suggestion, if you're interested, is to make the bridge longer, and go down one or two spaces, (emulating the sag), and it goes underneath the cafe...

dropping steeply away to meet the glittering inland sea to the far

here, toward a faint trail that traces its way across the top of a ridge,
follows it down the other side and then rises up to meet the tower's base.

Crag Tower Base~
The tower is a dark finger of stone, the same rock as the crag, from
which it looks like it grows.  The narrow trail leads right up to a small
doorstep.  Bushes and rocks line the base, so there is no way to walk
around the tower.  The door is of thick-looking, iron-bound, weathered
oak.  The steep cliff face looks as though it would provide many hand
holds, if an adventurous soul wanted to reach the fortress above.
~
[Seltha] This is where the skap stronghold used to be (back door) and the rdesc is the same saying that you can climb to the fortress above...

Main Room~
You stand in the main room of the slim tower.  It seems the rooms take up
whole levels, with a narrow stair along the wall, winding up to the next
level.  The floor is covered in expensive rugs, and the walls are covered
with tapestries, giving it a warm feel.  There is the usual furniture
for relaxing, studying, and socializing.  Cressets and a stone hearth
light and warm the room.

magical tools, and objects of other unknown use.  The walls are covered

continuing up and one window.

Some stuff looks alchemical, some looks mage-like.  Most of the tables

grove of stunted pines.  The trees grow closely together, in this spot
sheltered on three sides by steep hills, and in a few spots a few great
rocky rises reach up, covered with vegetation and towering far above your
head.

Great Cellar~
You stand in what was once a large, regular chamber.  From the grooves in
the stone floor, you realize that many booted feet have passed this way
before.  A great deal of general rubble and refuse litters the floor
here, signalling that few come this way any more.  You spy chambers
leading off in all four cardinal directions, and a stairway leading up
back towards the surface.

Bits of fresh meat lie scattered about the floor here.

A sign is planted here.

This road should go southeast..  generally toward trees/remaining forest
from around Medienne, then turn to plains and scrub near the inner sea
cliffs for most of the way, and finally get marshy/swampy (what IS the
difference??) and end in the K'ssk Swamp.  It'll have TONS of room to add
areas and other roads on to.

Eastern Sea Trail~
Less traveled upon than the rutted road just to the north, the Eastern sea
trail leads southwards from here.  Rich grass nourished by the sea
breezes threatens to overwhelm this unused track.  However, the woods on
either side of the path have been cut back a good distance to provide
protection for the casual wayfarer.

Emerging from the sheltered portions of the woods, the Eastern Sea Trail

shore breezes, the trees become smaller, warped and shriveled in
response to the salt-filled breezes and stormy winter gales.

Leaning precariously, boulders of various shapes and sizes jut up through

The sea beats firmly on the shore, as if this exact spot is the symbolic
example of the power and might of the sea.  The wind also whips through
this area, as if trying to blow you away from the sea.  It would take a
brave soul indeed to attempt to swim into those waves.

A strange and violent sea~
While waves crash and strong winds blow all around, this small patch of
water seems protected from the elements.  A light breeze brings the fresh
smell of the sea to your nose, and the sounds of the sea around you fill
your ears.

Rutted Road~
This travel worn road is generally the last voyage for many goods before
they are sold in the town of Medienne.  The loose packed dirt of the road
forms nasty mud holes during the winter months of this northern clime. 
On either side of the road, you see groves of wood and uninteresting
underbrush.

Below the Medienne Town Wall~
You stand in an open field, the grass underfoot kept short by the animals
grazed in this area.  The thick walls of Medienne tower over you to the
east, their fortifications weathered and scarred from scores of sieges
and fierce battles fought on them.  To the west and south, the open
spaces continue, while a road processes by to the north of here.

The grass here grows a bit thicker as you move further away from the
security offered by the walls of Medienne.  In the distance to the
northeast, you can see the West Gate of Medienne, while up a slight
incline to the south you spy the Medienne Town Graveyard, surrounded by
an old stone wall.

south here, moving away from the scarred walls of Medienne in the

above the brush, and as you pause for a moment you smell the sea in the
air, somewhere far off to the west.

Grassy Field~
The grass here is higher, due to less frequent use for grazing animals,
and the earth here soft underfoot, traveled by few other than the
occasional intrepid traveler and the wild creatures who find comfort in
the windswept fields and forgotten places of the realms.  Off to the
north, a rutted road passes obliviously by, following a downward slope
from east to west toward the source of an everpresent breeze which smells
of oceans and distant lands.

Windswept Brush~
The ground rises here, even as the brambles and snaggly branches grow
more and more cloying, harrying your progress until it becomes almost
negligible.  Standing on the small promontory, you can see a shimmering
arc of refracted light slung low below the horizon to the west - the sea. 
To the northeast, a small copse of wizened and bent trees clings to an
odd rise.  A small path leads down a steep slope to the west.

Brush~
Twisted bushes choke the meadow grasses here, until the open spaces begin
to close in on you as you pick your way between dark, thorned brush and a
few low-growing trees.  Beneath a drop to the north, a deeply rutted road
ambles its way down to the west, and up a slope east and back toward
Medienne.  West of here, a small but dense copse of trees clings to a
windy hilltop.

Windswept Copse~
You stand inside a small copse which lies on a slight rise.  To the east,
scrub bushes grow in the lee side of the hill as the ground falls away
toward the meadowy open spaces directly west of Medienne.  To the west,
the ground plunges downward toward the shore of the sea, and in the
distance you spy a road snake its way down to the waterline, where
several piers jut out into the choppy waters.

Weatherworn limbs intertwine like gnarled and ageless wooden fingers
overhead in the shadowy dimness created by the dense cluster of trees. 
The air strangely calm within this small grove, with incessant gusts of
wind whistling by unable to penetrate the screen of thick branches and
brush.  You stand at the highest point in the area, with a rutted dirt
road passing by to the north, at the foot of a steep, grassy slope.  To
the west, the ground falls away toward the distant shoreline, while to
the east it leads back through the brush a fields toward Medienne at a
more reasonable, gentle angle.  The copse continues off to the south.

siege of Medienne.  A number of rocks, fragments of the walls presumably,
lie scattered about the ground nearby.  The wall leads north and east
from here, while to the west you spy some open lands where the residents
of Medienne graze their animals in peaceful times.  To the south, a
gentle slope leads up toward a small hilltop.

up toward the horizon.  Close at hand, and far below you to the northeast
are the rough, choppy waters of the Inner Sea.  Finally, to the northwest
you spy densely forested mountains.

A large bronze bell is suspended from a wooden stand near the center of
the tower's roof, an alarm for the sentry to use should danger approach.

Pools of water compete with brown grasses and stunted bushes for space. 
To the north and east, steep hills rise up about the marsh, presumably

Considering this, you are suddenly thankful for the swift sea wind which
rushes in time and again from the east, to clear the swamp air from your
lungs, providing a well-needed momentary respite.

Windswept Marsh~
Though the water is deep in parts, one might pick his way though the
terrain, with sufficient care.  A few odd bushes grow on islands in this
sea of mud and water, signaling to you that this is not a place to remain
for long.

Windswept Marsh ~
A strong wind periodically rushes through the area, buffeting the stands
of tall, brownish grass which eke out an existence in this inhospitable
area.  To the northeast, a steep ridge climbs up towards the horizon,
toward more dry terrain.  To the west, the incessant crash of water on
stone signals the presence of the ocean.

Edge of a Marsh~
The ground sucks at anyone attempting movement here, its pungent mud and
pools of dark water slowing your progress.  Here and there, small islands
of grass and brush rise above the wetter, boggy areas, while all the
while a steady sea wind blows in from the west.  To the north and east,
you spy a road while to the east a steep ridge rises over you.

Windswept Brush - South of a Ridge~
To the north lies a tall rocky ridge, its scattered stones projecting
from the ground like the backbone of some immense, partially buried
dragon.  A dull landscape of tussocky grass and brush thickets grows amid
small, fetid ponds and patches of deep, pungent mud.

The moor and hillocks are bare, windswept.  Occasionally reedy grasses
bravely poke above the land.  Where the ground dips lower black water
accumulates, topped by a greenish scum.  A large ridge topped by jutting
stones lies to the east.

Windswept Moor - Brush~
The terrain is rough here, with odd mounts of stone and thick clusters of
brush rising out of swampy, murky areas and patches of open, grassy
meadow.  To the south, a wide slope rises, curving around the generous
smooth shoulder of a tall hill.

A new, but flimsy, sign is here.
~
[Cynthia] I think the orogs have been moved for long enuff that the flimsy sign is no longer needed and has been reduced to rubble by the elements :)    Also, at time of writing this, Orogs need a area description, and perhaps a better name? :)

Windswept Brush and Meadow~
Dull grasses lie in windswept fields, beneath the steep slopes to the
north.  An occasional hummock breaks the monotony.  Large animals have
left their marks in the grass like standing waves in the ocean.  A large
ridge, broken and tumbled, lies to the northeast and curves southward.

Windswept Brush - Near a Shallow Depression~
The land broadens into a shallow depression, filled along its center with
a stinking marsh set around with blackened reeds.  Beyond the edges of
the marsh grasses spread over the ground, brown and unhealthy.  To the
south, a copse of dead and dying trees surrounds an enormous grey
building.

The air here smells of ocean, even as a dull odor rises up from the muddy

steep to the north to even attempt to scale.  To the south, the brush
continues, with small hints of overgrown paths darting here and there
through a swampy area of brush and open meadow.

Tiny shrubs and trees grow along the edge of the chasm, hanging on with

carved over the ages by a tiny river that pours down from the mountains. 
Far to the south, the river empties into the Northern Sea.

The trail winds east and west here, across a sloped hillside.  To the

small, nameless river has cut a deep chasm, spanned by a sturdy bridge. 
On the other side of the chasm, the path seems to continue, wandering
along under under the shadow of the Cairn Mountains to the north.  A
large building sits to the south of the trail.

The smell of coffee and smoke, the clanking of dishes, and the murmur of

along the west wall, and several employees run back and forth attending
to the needs of running the establishment.  Chairs and a long bench are
scattered about the room, inviting you to rest your weary feet.  Two open
doorways almost fill the south and eastern walls, leading out to a
balcony that overlooks the Sea.  To the north, a pair of green swinging
doors hang on heavy iron hinges.

Eagle Eye Cafe - Southern End of the Balcony~
The balcony overlooks a steep cliff that leads far down to the Northern
Sea.  As far as you can see, the cool waters of the Sea stretch, silently
waving in the distance.  Thick wooden railings and sturdy planks make up
the balcony, preventing you from falling over the side, and only slightly
worn by time.  The wooden porch roof provides some shelter from the
elements, while leaving the view open to the south and east.

The magical symbols are ancient, perhaps they have something to do with

Northern sea~
The grand expanse of the Northern Sea spreads out to the southeast.  From
here you cannot hear the movement of the water, but you can smell it and
its brackish waters.

Eagle Eye Cafe - Eastern Side of the Balcony~
The balcony overlooks the Great Divide, and the tiny river that flows at
its bottom.  Just to the north, the famous Eagle Eye Bridge spans the
gap, bridging the human lands to the east and west.  To the east, on the
other side of the Divide, the forest spreads out and up the Cairn
Mountains.  The floor is comprised of thick and sturdy wooden planks, and
the balcony is covered by a porch-roof.  Thick beams support the roof,
and also the heavy railing along the eastern edge.  An open doorway leads
into the cafe itself.

The Great Divide leads down hundreds of feet.  At its bottom winds a

eagle eye bridge~
This grand bridge spans the width of the Great Divide.  Built of stone
and massive wooden timbers, it finally allowed travel from the human
lands to the east to the human lands to the west.  It is a wonderful
achievement of engineering, and is covered its distance by a wooden roof
that allows travelers to look out over the edge.

The thick wooden planks of the balcony are ancient and sturdy.  The tops
are rounded slightly from wear, and stained by countless spilled drinks.

Eagle Eye Cafe - Balcony Corner~
The view from here is spectacular; you can see an arc from the Eagle Eye
Bridge all the way to the western shore of the Northern Sea.  Far to the
southeast, the outline of a large keep set along the eastern shore of the
Sea can be seen.  And just south of that, the wooden docks of Medienne. 
From here, the water is silent, and the only sounds are those of the wind
whistling through the trees and the conversation from the cafe itself. 
Wooden planks make up the floor, and thick beams support the ceiling and
the guardrail.
