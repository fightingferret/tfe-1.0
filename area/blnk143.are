Shadowy Forest - Fog-Covered Trail~
Dozens of dark trees overhang this small trail here; their massive
branches nearly blocking the way.  Dry leaves are scattered about the
dark earth causing a cracking sound to echo throughout the woods
everytime you step.  A dense fog rolls across the path, swirling and
spiraling up everytime a small breeze blows through the trees.  Despite
the thick fog the trail to the north is free from it, giving you a clear
view out of the forest.  To the south the trail continues through the
winding trees, heading into darkness.

Shadowy Forest - Fog-Covered Trail~
The fog here is unnaturally thick making it difficult to see your
surroundings.  Large, dark trees line the path here and while most of
them stand erect, a few have become weak and started leaning over the
path, causing you to duck beneath them to continue on.  Peering through
the fog you can occasionally see a small, dark shape moving through it,
but it quickly vanishes before you can identify it.  To the north and
south the trail continues through the neverending darkness of the forest.

Shadowy Forest - Fog-Covered Trail~
Dozens of broken twigs and branches litter the trail before you, each
snapped in half as if many feet had crossed over them.  The dark soil is
covered with footprints but none are recognizable due to time taking its
toll on the trail.  Against the edge of the trail to the south a rusted
iron pike, covered in spots of dried blood, leans against one of the
massive dark trees.  The trail continues to swerve through the dense
forest to the north and west from here.

Scattered about the forest trail are hundreds of tiny bleached-white
bones, no larger than the size of your index finger.  Pieces of torn
leather and cloth hang from the branches of the overhanging trees, each
slowly wavering in the gentle breeze.  From somewhere deep inside the
forest you can hear the sound of rustling leaves, as if someone were
moving through the trees.  To the east and west the trail continues
through the fog-filled forest.

The dark soil of the path gives way to small patches of grass and moss. 
Tiny white flowers dot the edges of the trail, giving the dull, dark
scenery of the forest some color.  Swaying in the breeze from the
branches of the trees are small, ornate wood carvings, each different
from the other.  To the north the trail is barred by several tree trunks
which have fallen over but to the south it remains clear.

These minature ornaments have been carved into the shape of dancing

One carving stands out from the others; it has been carved in the shape
of a tiny faerie hovering over the body of a sea sprite.

tree trunks~
Set down across the path as if intentional and not by pure accident, the

them off the path but seems unlikely you could due to their weight.

Shadowy Forest - Fog-Covered Trail~
The fog on this portion of the trail has become extremely thick, dropping
visibility down to a few inches in front of you.  Peering through the fog
you can just barely make out the skeletal form of trees which line the
trail and act as your only landmark to keep you from straying off it. 
The ground is covered in mounds of damp leaves which quietly rustle as
you tread across them.  The trail looks as though it continues to the
north and west from here, but the fog makes it difficult to be sure.

The air is thick and musty here, as if you were in a deep underground
cavern.  The thick clouds of fog continually roll in from the depths of
the forest, obscuring everything except for the faint outlines of the
trees lining the trail.  Lying diagonally across the path is a splintered
tree trunk which is covered in a thick green slime.  A slight breeze
blows through the area, causing the leaves of the treetops above you to
rain droplets of dew down upon your head.  The trail continues through
the seemingly never-ending fog to the east and west.

you spot several small thatched huts on the edge of the trail.  Towering
up from what appears to be the center of the clearing is a massive black
tree.  The trail to the north is covered in a dense fog which limits

Bits of moldy straw line the edge of the path, covered in an odorous

disturbance to the relatively peaceful domain.  Off to the southeast and
southwest, many small thatched huts, which look weather-worn due to the

has been cleared southward to reach the huts.  The path also continues to

A gigantic fallen log lies horizontally to the west, sealing off normal
passage in that direction.  Blanketing the decaying bark of the log are
many rows of mushrooms and large patches of moss.  They seem to be
thriving, evinced by the abundance and astoundingly large size of the
mushrooms and dark-green moss.  In addition, many colonies of tiny
insects can be seen crawling their away below and along the ridges of the
log's bark.  The trail continues to wind its way to the east and south
around the log.

Shadowy Forest - Muddy Trail~
You have to be rather careful in maneuvering your way around this trail,
as several shallow pools of dirty, foul-smelling water have randomly
formed.  Many twigs and leaves gently float upon the surfaces of the
pools, having fallen from the surrounding trees to the east and west.  So
many of the twigs and leaves have accumulated that they nearly conceal
the pools' surfaces.  Peering through the towering trees and plants to
the east, you can spot some small thatched huts.

A massive wall of vegetation grows to the west.  It consists of long,
light-green strands of ivy which wind their way closely within a
profusion of large ferns and thick bushes, impeding progress in that
direction.  The trail forks off in three different directions.  To the
east, the trail appears to be drier, but also narrower; while travel
north and south looks messy due to increased moisture on the ground.

You notice the lack of light able to pass through the towering trees of
the forest.  Many plants, like the ones in the dense foliage to the west,
have still managed to flourish here.  Perhaps the soil is rich with
nutrients, or perhaps the plants have somehow adapted well to their dark
environs.  To the east, past a short, ivy-covered wooden fence and a few
trees, lies a small thatched hut that looks weather-beaten and worn.  The
trail continues to the north and south, weaving its way through the
forest.

overtake the bushes.  Beyond the bushes are tall trees with trunks as
wide as two ogres.  The dark branches of the trees form a complex canopy. 
Combined with the overgrowing bushes, the branches form a web-like
pattern cloaking anything that may exist beyond them.

A thin layer of red-brown leaves is slightly more visible along this
portion of the trail.  Some of the leaves have become deeply immersed
within the mud, while the rest have risen above the muddy surface to form
small soggy piles.  The piles look like miniature knolls and give off a
wretched odor.  Passage to the north and south seems improbable due to
the abundant overgrowth of plants in those directions.  The trail is
relatively clear to the east and west, however.

An occasional calm breeze from the forest to the south feels like someone
whispering gently in your face.  Towering dark trees grow closely there,
their branches intermingling with one another to form an impassable
barrier.  On the ground, you can detect the outlines of many leaves which
have been submerged within the mud.  Several of the leaves still clutter
the surface of the trail, indicating that those had recently fallen from
the trees all around you.  A small footpath has been cleared to the
north; while the trail continues through the forest to the east and west.

they prevent normal access through them.  Extensive strands of
olive-green ivy hang tightly from the long dark branches of the trees and
block out part of the trail.  Moss also grows along the barks of several
of the trees, covering about a quarter of their trunks.  The muddy trail

Small white flowers grow along the edge of the trail adding a touch of

close together.  Between two of the pine trees to the south a dense wall

A gust of wind passes once in a while through the trail, disrupting the
apparent serenity of the forest.  The resulting rustling of the leaves of
the near-by trees and ferns provides the only noticeable sounds within
this dark forest.  Focusing your gaze upward, you marvel at the
tremendous heights the trees have reached.  Their branches and leaves
criss-cross to prevent you from accurately determining how high the trees
have grown.  Red, mud-covered leaves lie randomly along the trail as it

Shadowy Forest - Muddy Trail~
The strong smell of decaying flesh fills the air along the trail here. 
Splintered tree trunks lie scattered about the trail, covered in a thick
layer of mud.  Partially buried beneath the mud are several shortswords;
each broken in half and covered in rust.  Clinging to the branches of the
surrounding trees are several pieces of tattered blood-stained cloth.  A
small break in the trees to the east allows you a view across the Sea of
Stars.  The trail curves to the north and west here, proceeding along the
forest clearing.

Piled up in the center of the trail here are the corpses of several
gnomes; each still retaining bits of their leather armor upon their
bodies.  Lying scattered about the pile of bodies are several
blood-stained pikes and halberds which still have bits of decaying flesh
attached to their blades.  A small mound of damp leaves lying just off
the eastern side of the path poorly covers the decaying remains of what
looks like a faerie.  The trail wanders off to the north and south from

A massive puddle spans the width of the trail here, making travel around

Shadowy Forest - Muddy Trail~
Tiny mounds of white sand dot the surface of the trail here, standing out
against the blood-red mud.  The stiff breeze which blows through the
trees carries with it the scent of salt water and seaweed.  As the trees
sway back and forth along the eastern edge of the trail you can
occasionally catch a glimpse of waves crashing against the shoreline of a
beach.  Directly to the west, partially obscured by thick vines hanging
down from the trees, is a small thatched hut.  The trail continues to

mud like jagged sword edges.  Between a pair of immensely large trees on
the eastern edge of the trail, you notice a small tunnel heading out of
the forest although it is far too small for anyone larger than a faerie
to enter.  The trail continues to the west and south from here, heading

The leaves of the tree are a sickly black color and ooze a thick, black
sap which drops to the ground where it has collected in large puddles. 
Around the base of the tree a thick brown moss has begun to grow although
none of it has grown over the tree's bark.  Small footpaths span out in

Shadowy Forest - Small Footpath Between Huts~
Cluttered along the soft soil of the footpath are various debris.  Broken
remnants of the picket fences to the east and west of you have been blown
or tossed onto the path, as well as the decaying remains of some small,
possibly humanoid creature.  The smell is overwhelming, and even more so
when a breeze from the southern part of the forest carries it to your
face.  You can travel around the debris and head south or north along the
footpath.

Shadowy Forest - Intersection of Footpaths~
The ground here is littered with small piles of shattered bone fragments;
each partially covered with a thick orange moss.  Lying off the edge of
each corner of the intersection are the remains of small wooden fences
which are now nothing more than weathered and warped planks of wood.  A
stiff breeze constantly blows through the treetops, causing the branches
to sway and crack as if they could break free at any moment.  Off to the
west you can just make out a large black tree jutting up from the center
of the clearing.  Footpaths span out in all directions from here,
continuing through the massive clearing.

Several barrels have been stacked upon along the edges of the footpath
here; each broken open revealing a clear liquid within them.  An
overwhelming scent of pure alcohol emanates from within the barrels
causing your eyes to tear-up and burn.  Tucked in between a few of the
barrels are moth-eaten burlap sacks within which you can see small strips
of rotted meat.  Imprinted into the dark soil are several humanoid-
looking footprints, no larger than two inches long.  The trail continues
its course through the forest to the north and south from here.

The stench of decaying meat engulfs this room, like a dark cloud which
doesn't want to dissipate.  Looking at the ground, you notice small
mounds, each about a foot high.  Partially buried within one of the
mounds are tiny bits of stale meat and miniature bones that are
unrecognizable.  Directly to the north and south of you are
decrepit-looking thatched huts.  Not enough straw covers the roof of the
huts, leaving noticeable gaps and little protection from the elements.

Cracked, gray wooden fences form discontinuous lines along the eastern

Tall, thick grass and long, snake-like vines cover this narrow dirt trail. 
The branches of the dark trees rest low to the ground here, causing you
to continually duck your head to avoid bumping into one.  The ground,
although appearing to be dry, has a moist, swamp-like feeling to it and
every step you take causes a squishing sound to echo throughout the
silent woods.  To the east a dense wall of vegetation hangs down from the
branches of the trees, making travel in that direction nearly impossible.

fallen tree trunks and dense vegetation.  The soft dark soil beneath your
feet is covered in two inch deep footprints made by something carrying a

Shadowy Forest - Before a Crude Stone Altar~
Resting in the center of this small clearing is a black stone altar
surrounded by blood-red colored stones.  At the foot of the altar are
several dozen humanoid skulls which have been stripped of their lower jaw
bone and covered with a thick red substance.  Thick walls of thorns,
within which are several entangled humanoid remains, lie along the
outskirts of the clearing.  Above you the tree tops utterly block out all
light which dares try to enter this forsaken forest.

black stone altar blood-red colored stones~
This altar stands several feet high with round red stones circling its
base.  It's constructed of a solid back stone which shows few signs of
wear and tear.  At the middle of the altar is a nest-like counter filled
with charred branches that are now too flimsy to be of any use.
~
E
foot humanoid skulls bone red substance~
The skulls are jawless, and some are cracked.  You notice cuts and holes
demonstrating that some of their poor owners had been bludgeoned badly. 
Gooey red ooze has drenched itself on top of and within the skulls.  The
skulls are humanoid, but smaller than a normal human's and a little
thicker.

E
1 east 1 west walls thorns~
Huge, multi-layered walls filled with sharp thorns surround you.  The
tips of some of the thorns are covered in blood, a testament to the
dangers of attempting to pass through them.  An even more auspicious
example of the dangers are the trapped bones of a few unfortunate
travellers.
~
E
entangled humanoid remains~
The bones and decayed flesh of some unsuspecting explorers lie trapped
within the wall of thorns.  The remains dangle off the thorns and
occasionally shake with the breeze which passes by.

On a Crude Wooden Platform Within the Black Tree~
This large, makeshift platform has been crudely slapped together with
rickety boards.  Every time a small breeze blows through the trees, the
platform shakes and rattles as if at any moment it could give way and
send you tumbling to the forest floor below.  Nailed against the thick
trunk in the center of the platform is a small set of wooden steps which
lead up towards the top of the tree.  To the east, west and south large,
thick branches spread out over the clearing.

Along a Thick Dark Branch~
The branch shows serious signs of mistreatment; someone has attempted to
saw through half the branch making it very weak and unstable.  Several
rickety wooden boards hang off the edge of the branch, possibly the
remains of a catwalk which used to be here.  Small gaps in the leaves
allow a clear view to the forest floor below and the thatched huts which
dot the landscape.  To the north the branch thins out a bit as it
stretches over the forest.  A wooden platform has been erected around
the trunk to the west.

Most of this section of the branch is covered in a thick grey moss which

might shine through.  Above you, high up in the tree top, are several
small tree houses which are just barely visible through the dense foilage. 
A small wooden platform has been erected at the edge of the branch to the

The branch continues to the west, proceeding back to the trunk.

The remains of a small wooden platform rest along this section of the
branch; its rickety boards on the verge of breaking in two.  Small wooden
wind chimes have been hung from the surrounding branches which gently tap
together as a breeze blows through the tree; creating an eerie music
which echoes through the tree.  The dense foliage all around you blocks
out all light whatsoever that tries to enter the forest and only a few
small gaps allow a glimpse down to the forest floor below.  The branch
begins to thin out to the north as it advances to its edge.  To the east
a rickety wooden platform has been erected around the trunk.

This large tree house has been elegantly decorated with fine silk
tapestries and and finely carved furniture.  Resting against the southern
wall is a small wooden table a mere five inches tall covered in stacks of
paper.  A small, gold-plated throne with red rubies embedded into the
backboard and arm rests in the center of the room.  Hanging from the
eastern wall is an enormous silk tapestry depicting black-skinned faeries
battling tiny sea-green colored sprites on a vast beach.  A thick wall of

reading them you see that they contain an outline for an attack on the

Chiiron with the statement "They'll never see us coming from here!"

Within a Broken-Down Tree House~
Broken and splintered wooden boards litter the floor of this small tree
house.  The walls, ceiling and parts of the floor have broken away
leaving wide gaps which you could easily fall through if not careful. 
Still hanging from the western wall are two sets of shelves upon which
rest rusty cups and small candle holders.  The doorframe to the south
leans at an awkward angle and appears very unstable, as if it could
collapse at any moment, sending the tree house crashing to the ground
below.

Several cracks have formed along the tan-colored branch here.  The bark

The branch forks off to the east and west from here, thinning out
considerably as it spreads over the forest.  Bits of the bark from the
branch have broken free, revealing tan wood riddled with termite
holes.  Hanging from a few of the upper branches of the tree are the
remains of small wooden platforms; now nothing more than rickety planks
of wood.  Clearly visible off to the north a bit is a small wooden
platform which has been built around the trunk of the tree.

Along a Weak and Decaying Branch~
The branch beneath your feet constantly bends and quivers violently with
every minute movement you make.  An army of termites scurry across the
decaying bark of the branch, gnawing away at what little wood remains. 
Throughout the leaves of the surrounding branches you notice that several
spiders have made their home here; their delicate silken webs glistening
when light breaks through the tree top and strikes them.  To the south
the branch thins out considerably, becoming but a mere twig.  To the east
the branch widens a bit as it reaches a fork in itself.

The branch here is fairly thin; averaging no more than seven inches
across.  With every gust of wind that blows through the tree the branch
sways and bends uneasily, as if at any moment it could snap beneath the
weight of your body.  The foliage is quite thin along the surrounding
branches, giving you a clear glimpse to the surrounding forest.  Through
a gap in the leaves you spy a large waterfall pouring off a cliff to the
southeast.  The branch extends to the north from here, heading back
towards the trunk.

Along a Weak and Decaying Branch~
The branch thins out as it extends further south.  It seems to have a
difficult time trying to support any weight as it sways gently when
buffetted by a gust of wind.  Several scratches on the side of its bark
appear to have come from below.  Judging by the location and small size
of the scratches, they were probably caused by arrows hitting the branch
from below.  The scratches along the branch reveal a light yellow-colored
interior.  Broad leaves grow all along the branch, and many more blanket
the area above you.  Some of the leaves are a yellow-green color and
appear less than healthy.  The branch also looks passable westward.

You are on the thin tip of a dark gray branch of the great tree.  The
branch doesn't appear able to support much weight on it and looks ready
to break from any quick, sudden movements.  Many yellow-green leaves grow
at its southern edge, drooping lazily to the ground below.  The ground
looks pretty far from here, and you think it would be wise to maintain
your balance as best you can to prevent any disastrous fall.  The branch
thickens if you carefully move north.

Shattered fragments of book shelves and chairs lie in disorganized heaps
all around this hut.  Their wooden parts have been mostly cracked and
chewed away by termites.  Along the floor beside the fragile-looking
walls of the room are layers of dried leaves and small twigs.  Blood

Within a Small Thatched Hut~
Broken furniture, ranging from chairs to tables, litters the earth floor
of this small hut.  The walls and ceiling of the hut are in a serious
state of disrepair as several areas of the thatch give way to gaping
holes.  Hanging from the western wall is a torn silk tapestry; its fine
silk now threadbare and covered in grime.  Resting in the southeast
corner of the room, propped up between the walls is a dwarf-sized
skeleton covered in a grey moss.  A small door set into the northern wall
leads out of the hut.

The thatch walls look flimsy, almost unable to support the weight they

Bits of straw hang loosely from the ceiling above.  Wide gaps can be seen
all across the roof, probably accounting for some of the moisture on the
floor.
~
E
torn silk tapestry~
This once fine tapestry depicting some sort of tranquil landscape has now
become a barely recognizable piece of fabric.  Splotches of a sickly
green substance dot the thin silk, and parts of its edges have been
chewed away.  The cut pieces of the tapestry droop downward, revealing
holes and the thatch wall behind them.
~
E
southeast dwarf-sized skeleton grey moss~
The skeleton sits hunched over in the corner of the hut.  It appears to
be of a short humanoid.  On the back of its round skull, which droops to
the side, are several holes the size of a small blade of grass.  Some
clumps of a grey moss grow along the arm and leg bones, indicating that
the skeleton's owner probably died a long time ago.

Within a Small Thatched Hut~
This small hut seems relatively undisturbed; all of the furniture is
intact and neatly set about the room.  Resting in the northeast corner of
the room is a small bed barely large enough to fit a dwarf-sized man.  A
large walnut bookcase stands against the western wall, covered in bits of
moldy hay and some green slime.  Lying in the northwest corner of the
room are the decomposing remains of a small gnome; his greyish-colored
skin covered in old bruises and blood stains.  A small thatch door,
riddled with gaps in its straw, has been set into the southern wall.

a small duck feather pillow which is covered in dried blood stains.

This beautiful carved bookcase is made from the finest walnut you have

Bits of moldy hay rest along the top of the bookcase, emanating a foul
stench.  An unidentifiable green slime has also collected atop the
bookcase which slowly drops down its sides.

This small gnome seems to have met a horrible death as his
greyish-colored skin is scarred with many black and blue bruises.  Large

crushed by some tremendous force.

Broken pieces of furniture that would fit someone of gnome-sized stature
lie scattered on the dirt floor.  Numerous leaves have collected on the
furniture, most likely having fallen through the large gaps in the straw
roof of the hut.  At one end of the hut is a pile of cracked skulls with
spear marks around them.  The skulls reveal that their small humanoid
owners had been brutally bludgeoned, stabbed, and charred.  A small door,
dotted with small holes, lies to the north and leads to the outside.

Shadowy Forest - Before a Dense Wall of Thorns~
Rising up before you to the south is a massive wall of sharp thorns, each
dripping a gooey black substance which sizzles as it hits the ground. 
Lying at the base of the thorn wall are several small piles of bone
fragments, no more than an inch long.  Small sets of what appear to be
animal tracks have been imprinted into the dark, damp soil beneath your
feet, heading off to the north.  On either side of you, the trees of the
forest have grown so close together as to block travel in those
directions.  To the north a dense wall of vegetation dangles from the
tree branches above.

Growing in a rectangular configuration to the south is a wall of thorny
branches.  The gray and brown branches extend over ten feet from the
ground.  They resemble long, bony fingers with sharp fingernails.  Thorns
as round as a spool and as sharp as a needle jut out from the branches. 
Dripping slowly, but continuously, from them is a thick, black substance. 
The substance is viscous and opaque, although you can see a few air
bubbles in it.

Shadowy Forest - Silent Path~
This small dirt trail is covered with several thousand multi-colored
leaves.  The trees lining the edge of the path are a mixture between the
black trees which dominate the forest and some healthy-looking oak trees
whose bark is a rich brown color.  A gentle breeze blows through the path
here causing the trees to bend and sway gracefully yet no sound issues
forth from them as they tap each other.  To the north, a dense wall of
gleaming black thorns has formed, while to the south, the path continues
unhindered.

Shadowy Forest - Silent Path~
Almost hidden amongst the overgrowth around you, you notice several large
statues carved in the form of gnomish warriors dressed for battle.  Time
and weather have taken their toll on the statues; many of them are
missing arms, and several slabs of stone have been chipped away.  Thick
ivy vines have grown over just about everything along the path here
including the trees, allowing no light to reach this part of the trail. 
To the east a massive waterfall can be clearly seen pouring off a cliff,
yet no sounds issue forth from the raging water.

Cascading down off a rocky cliff face to the east is a magnificent
waterfall of crystal clear water.  At the base of the cliff is a large
clear pool of water surrounded by pearly-white stones where the waterfall
deposits its liquid.  The trees surrounding the trail have spaced out
quite a bit, allowing small rays of sunlight to shine in, reflecting off
the mist of the waterfall and creating a beautiful rainbow.  Next to the
pool of water are several small white marble benches, allowing travellers
a place to rest a moment.  To the west the trail continues back into the

Behind a Shimmering Waterfall~
The loud roaring of the waterfall to the west echoes around the smooth
stone walls of this dark cavern.  Lying partially entombed beneath the
stone floor are several humanoid skeletons; each covered in ages of dust. 
Erected in the center of the room is a large stone altar composed of
slabs of white marble.  Scattered about the surface of the altar are
several handfuls of dried white flower petals which emanate a strong
scent of honey.  Hammered into the walls with steel spikes are several
white sconces; each containing a torch covered in several layers of
cobwebs.  Mounds of large stones have been piled of against the eastern
side of the cave, apparently from a cave-in which occurred some time ago.

Within a Brightly Lit Cavern~
Several dozen blazing torches have been set into golden sconces all along
the walls of this small cavern.  A small campfire rests in the center of
the room, heating the room and lighting it brightly.  Scattered all about
the cavern are small bedrolls and cooking utensils.  Painted across the
walls are several large murals depicting an army of dark faeries in
fierce combat with tiny sea sprites atop a sandy cliff.  Cut into the
cavern's ceiling is a small vent hole from which a small amount of light
enters.  A large mound of stone rubble lies against the western wall of
the cavern.

[Terek] Rainbow Faeries are allies to the sea sprites, she came here
[Terek] Looking for her sea-sprite friend who vanished and got attacked
[Terek] And therefore its quest time.

torches sconces~
The semi-circular sconces are shiny gold and show little tarnish.  They
are firmly set against the wall by steel rivets.  The torches burn
brightly within the sconces.  Combined with the reflective material of
the sconces, the torches seem to provide even more light to the room.

E
walls murals~
Bright colors have been used to depict various battles between small,
winged faeries and sprites with webbed feet.  Most show the faeries
victorious, smugly standing on top of the corpses of the defeated sprites.

E
bedrolls cooking utensils~
The bedrolls are made of a thin, blue fabric.  They look to be only able
to fit someone shorter than a foot.  Beside the bedrolls are tiny spoons,
forks, and bowls that still contain bits of food in them.  All of the
utensils could fit in the palm of your hand.

E
ceiling vent hole~
The round hole in the ceiling looks to be the size of a halfling's finger. 
It seems to be the main source of fresh air for this room.

1 west mound stone rubble~
To the west are brownish bits of rubble which rest on top of one another
in a cone-like, tight formation.

@WUpon entering the cave you immediatly notice a wounded rainbow faerie
lying in a pool of her own blood upon the floor.  Her tiny body quakes
and shivers as if afflicted with some type of poison.
