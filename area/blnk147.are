A Crumbling Hole~
The loose rock around you crumbles at every breath, but the underlying
foundation of rock and sun-baked sand seems solid enough.  A dark hole
descends into the loose earth at your feet, yet the air seeping up from
the depths below is warm and smells of brimstone, not the cool air one
expects from a cave.  The rock wall to the east seems brittle.

A Dark Hole~
Nearly vertical, this dark hole descends into the putrid bowels of the
earth.  Natural footholds at irregular yet steady intervals make the
descent a relatively easy one.  Above you, deteriorating rock forms a
strange crumbling hole leading toward the surface.  From below rises the
acrid smell of brimstone.

A Dark Cavern Smelling of Brimstone~
While there is no true light source in this dark cavern, something to the
north glows a dull red-orange.  The air is decidedly hot and stale,
smelling strongly of brimstone.  A small, dark hole leads up, toward
cooler desert air.  The floor at your feet is smooth, flawless obsidian. 
There has definitely been some volcanic activity in this region.  A black
corridor leads north toward the red glow.

Dull Red Cavern~
A massive cavern vaults above you, easily a hundred feet overhead and a
hundred more wide.  More impressive still is the fact that the majority
of the cavern's width north to south is a sixty-foot wide river of
@Rmolten lava@n.  The hundred million or so tons of lava send simmering
waves of heat and a low wavelength of red light across the cavern,
outlining openings in the cavern walls at various points.  Obsidian
ledges follow the lava flow to the east and west, while a dark corridor
leads south away from the river.  There is no discernable way across the
lava.

The flow itself is over fifty feet in width and widens further as it

This smooth ledge of glassy obsidian slowly climbs upwards from west to

the river of lava to your north with some apprehension.  The ledge seems
to bend northward to your near east, and it begins to bridge the river of
lava below as it hugs the eastern walls of the cavern.  To your north you
can make out the far ledge on the other side of the river.  It seems to

Obsidian Ledge~
This ledge of black obsidian climbs ever upwards from west to east.  The
ledge widens and narrows, making travel more difficult at points.  A hot
lava flow runs westward far below you and volcanic gases rise up from the
lava to choke you from your vantage point.  A similar ledge parallels
this one across the molten river but it is a few feet lower.  It nearly
intersects this ledge, which bends northward to the east as it almost
bridges the gap of the lava flow.

The ledge bends here where it meets with the southeastern wall of the

different places along the ridge.  Northward, the ledge has flattened out
and hugs the eastern wall where it slowly bridges the flow of lava.  To
the northwest, a steady flow of lava travels westward, bounded by ledges
to the north and south.

Obsidian Ledge - Split in the Natural Bridge~
This narrow ledge on the eastern cavern wall bridges the gap over the
river of lava below you.  The bridge here has split, making travel
southward difficult.  A thin crevice of four inches separates the two
bridges.  There is also an eight to ten foot difference in height between
the two separated ledges, but the ledge above looks climbable as several
half-bubble shaped footholds are riddled into the ridge.

Obsidian Ledge - Overhang~
This obsidian ledge bends here, walled in to the north and east by the
black rock.  It shines and undulates as it reflects the fiery lava flow
below you to the southwest.  To the west, the ledge parallels the river
of lava flowing in the same direction.  To the south, the ledge extends
to lean precariously over the flow of lava, but you notice that the
bridge has broken in two a little ways away.

Obsidian Ledge - Cave Entrance~
This obsidian ledge leans over a molten river of lava to your south.  The
lava is the source for light in the cavern but the black obsidian absorbs
most of it, and the cavern is extremely dark despite the hot, red flow. 
The ledge slowly descends as it travels from the east to the west,
finally descending to the level of the lava which lies sixty feet below
you.  Despite the distance, the air here is unusually hot and humid.  To
your north, a large hole has been made in the black obsidian, about ten
feet in diameter.  Long ago, a flow of lava must have melted through the
thick rock and left this opening in the cavern.

Obsidian Tunnel - Branching North~
What seems to be a larger tunnel, about twelve feet in diameter, leads
east and west, while a slightly smaller branch leads north toward a dull
red glow.  You can see another intersection of sorts to the west, while
the tunnel either comes to a dead end or makes a sharp turn to the east.

Obsidian Tunnel - Sharp Bend~
Although at first this appears to be a dead end, you can now clearly
see that the tunnel bends sharply, a smaller passage leading roughly
southwest and into the obsidian rock.  From the south, you can see a dull
red glow.  To the west, the larger tunnel continues.

Obsidian Tunnel - Nearing a Red Room~
From the south, a fierce dark red glow sends waves of heat and light
rippling across the walls of the tunnel.  This tunnel is small, only
about eight feet across, but to the north the tunnel widens as it makes a
hairpin loop to the west.  To the south, as the tunnel becomes more and
more saturated in the eerie crimson light, there appears to be an
chamber of sorts.

Obsidian Chamber~
A large, bowl-shaped chamber has been melted out of the solid obsidian
rock, lit a fierce red by the simmering pool of lava in the center of the
room.  A narrow catwalk, about six feet wide, circumvents the pool,
roughly circular in shape.  A tunnel leads through the rock to the north
and away from the intense heat.

Skirting the edge of the molten pool, a narrow ledge of smoothest
obsidian offers little in the way of footing.  Precariously, it slants
toward the bubbling magma.
~
E
pool lava~
This pool of lava has naturally melted the rock here into the smooth bowl
it resides in.  Thick spurts of rock randomly shower the air with a red
rain, while colder, nearly solid rock floats on top, churning around
actively.  The pool's deep red glow provides a fair amount of light to
this chamber.
~
E
obsidian rock~
The black, glass-like obsidian of this chamber is very smooth and
circularly surrounds the room.  Most likely the chamber was caused by
some great bubble of air trapped within the lava.  It shines the pool's
light off its dark surface and reflects its red glow about the room.

Bend in the Obsidian Tunnel~
To the east, you can make out a bright glow of red, probably from a lava
stream or pool that has emerged from the ground.  The black rock flickers
along the sides of the east tunnel like a dark fire.  South of you, the
black rock leads into darkness, but you can feel a tiny breeze of air
which brings with it the rotten smell of sulfur.

Obsidian Chamber - Lava Pool~
A large pool of molten lava casts its dark red glow onto the black

A small tunnel leads into the rock to the west, away from the heat.

Along an Obsidian Tunnel~
This tunnel winds its way north and south, although it twists and turns
in some places.  A red glow comes from the north, flickering off of the
mirror-like obsidian walls.  You can feel a rumbling sound from below
your feet, perhaps a flow of lava.

The ground rumbles beneath your feet, like the murmuring of angry titans,

settling over the polished obsidian as though the walls themselves were
molten hot, with only the occasional shadow to remind the eye of the
depthless black that lies beneath.

mirrors ablaze with its touch.  To the south, the glow lingers and fades

Before a Great Lava Pool~
A massive pool of bright red lava lights this room up, reflecting off the
black obsidian.  The pool itself is alive, churning small spots of nearly
solid black rock about in its wake.  A sulfurous smell emanates from
small bubbles that pop out of the lava, and the air here is hot and
thick, clouded over in some areas by dark volcanic gases.  The red light
glints @Rcrimson@n off of a small rock embedded in the north wall.

The dark tunnel bends from south to west, heading toward the source of a
dull red-orange glow in the latter direction.  To the south, there seems
to be some sort of intersection in the darkness.  The walls are
featureless, flawless, the obsidian rock a solid face devoid of
imperfections.
