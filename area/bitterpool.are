Before the Bitter Pools~
From this vantage you can see for quite some distance to the northeast. 
Stagnant pools of black water and murky, lifeless land, seem to stretch
out to envelop you.  The only passage in the direction of the desolate
wasteland, to the north is across a narrow ledge between two hissing,
acrid pools.  Another pool, smelling of sulfur, lies to the south, beyond
which is a small road.

Between the Bitter Pools~
You are standing on a narrow, precarious ledge between two foul, black
pools.  To the south a ledge rises over a cliff towards the wall of what
appears to be a city, while to the north the ledge crosses the pools and
enters a vast wasteland.  A strange oily black weed seems to grow inside
the pools, somehow drawing life from the lifeless waters.

The Southern Edge of a Dead Land~
Sinkholes and spongy marsh lie before you, crisscrossed with a network of
jagged stone ledges rising above the soft ground.  The spidery walkways
which seem most reliable head to the north, east, and west, and to the
south a wider rock ledge leads toward a foul-smelling pool.

of the ledge here crumbles and decays as the very life of the rock is
drained by its lifeless surroundings.

A Narrow Ledge Above a Sinkhole~
This crumbling rock ledge zigzags its way from east to west, surrounded
to the north and south by a murky grey marsh.  A thin, dank fog lurks in
the air, stifling any wind that might find its way this far through the
stagnant air of the Barrens.

A Narrow Ledge Beside a Walled City~
The ledge comes to an abrupt end here in sight of the walls of a large
city.  A tall tower rises from the high crest of the wall, ending in a
desolate, crumbling roof in great disrepair.  To the north and south the
deep, foul marshes stretch, an impassable barrier.  The only exit is
along the rock ledge to the west.

can barely be seen through the dank fog.  The ledge rises to the west.

This ledge appears stable and in better condition than the crumbling ones
