Before a Black Obsidian Temple~
Carved into the northern cavern wall is a massive temple made of black
obsidian stone.  A dark grey stone staircase climbs up towards a set of
massive black iron double doors.  Gigantic blood-red colored stone
pillars have been set above the staircase.  Between each of the pillars
are grotesque statues, carved in the likeness of humans, but bent over in
pain and horribly mutilated.  Etched into the ceiling, just above the
pillars is a large blood-red triangle with an eye in the center of it. 
To the south a cobweb-filled tunnel heads off into darkness.

staircase~
The staircase is made from a dark grey stone which has streaks of black
running through it.  The aged stone steps are scarred with various cracks
and a few stones are missing.  Looking closely you notice that a reddish
liquid flows down the stairs, coming from toward the direction of the
black iron doors.
~
E
pillars blood-red~
The pillars have been crafted from a blood-red colored stone which gives
of the appearence of fresh blood.  Each of the pillars have had strange
sigils and glyphs carved into them; their meaning completely foreign to
you.  Several of the massive cylinders of stone have large cracks running
through them and look unstable and may collapse at any moment.
~
E
grotesque statues humans~
The statues have been made from an ash-grey colored granite and carved in
the likeness of humans, but bent over with a look of agony on their face
and few horribly mutilated and disfigured.  A few of the statues depict
ghastly positions as you notice the maker of the statues made every
detail present in his work; wounds down to the bone can be plainly seen
and flesh stripped off some of the bones.  Examining each statue
carefully you notice that small rivers of blood flow from their eyes and
low, agonizing moans of pain emanate from within them.
~
E
ceiling triangle symbol mark~
Carved into the ceiling arch, just above the rows of pillars is a massive
triangle with a giant open eye within it.  The eye is composed of several
black and red gems which twinkle in the light and make it appear as if it
were winking.  Around the interior of the triangle several red
bloodstones have been placed, making the eye appear bloodshot.  Beneath
the triangle are several blocks of discolored stone bearing what appears
to be writing but it is too far away to see exactly what it says.

Black Temple - Entrance Foyer~
Enormous silk tapestries hang from the walls of this entrance chamber,
The grey and black tiled stone walls have been finely worked, showing no
signs of blemishes or impurities.  Upon the floor is a grotesque mural of
black-skinned demons feasting upon the remains of humans and elves. 
Hanging from the ceiling is a large chandelier composed of humanoid
bones, on which several black tallow candles have been lit, supplying the
room with just barely enough light to see ones hand in front of their
face.  To the east, north, and west dark corridors make their way to the
interior of the temple.  To the south, massive iron double doors mark the
exit out.

silk tapestries~
The tapestries each depict several black-robed clerics of Morkith during
acts of sacrifice.  One tapestry shows a elf strapped to a black stone
altar while a cloaked priest raises a wavy-bladed dagger high above his
head, preparing to impale the elf.  Another tapestry shows several
clerics standing in a circle watching as a human is devoured by a shadowy
beast.  One extremely large tapestry catches your eye as it portrays a
horde of demons slaughtering an elven village with great detail;
decapitated bodies lie scattered between the small huts and elves impaled
in pikes rise above the horizon.
~
E
grotesque mural floor~
The mural has been painted by a skilled hand and depicts a very grotesque
scene of a feast of flesh.  Several horned demons sit at a large stone
table tearing the limbs from the corpses of several elves, humans and
dwarves.  Chalices filled with blood from the dead are passed around the
table as are plates with heaps of flesh upon them.  Behind the table a
river of blood flows by rapidly, littered with the floating corpses of
gnomes and halflings.  One extremely large demon with black, scaled skin
sits at the head of the table with the head of a high elf held
triumphitly above him.  Examining it more closely you notice in the far
corner of the mural, behind the table of demons sits a shadowy figure
draped in flowing black robes surveying the feast.
~
E
chandelier bones candles tallow~
The chandelier is composed of several humanoid leg and arm bones with
their skulls used as candle holders.  Atop the skulls rest long black
tallow candles which flicker with purplish flame, shedding a small amount
of light on the chamber and surrounding hallways.  Bits of flesh still
hang from a few of the skulls as does droplets of blood.  The chandalier
is held in place by a thick metal chain which heads up towards the
ceiling but quickly vanishes from sight as it reaches a blanket of
darkness which the candles do not seem to penetrate.

Black Temple - Bloody Hallway~
The smooth black obsidian walls of the hallway here are covered in a
thick layer of blood.  Large cracks running along the length of the
ceiling drip with fresh blood which slowly trickles down the walls and
onto the floor where a large puddle has collected.  Partially entombed in
the eastern wall are the skeletal remains of a large humanoid.  To the
south a large, faintly lit chamber opens up while to the north the
hallway continues into darkness.

smooth black obsidian walls~
The smooth black obsidian walls of the hallway are covered in a thick
layer of blood which slowly runs down and collects into a puddle upon the
floor.  Every crevice and seam within the wall is covered with the
crimson liquid and the light emanating from the south hallway bounces off
of it and causes the chamber to glow with a red aura.
~
E
cracks ceiling~
Various cracks run down the length of the ceiling from within which
droplets of blood drip down and slowly trickle down the walls and collect
into a puddle which spans the width of the floor.  The cracks are no more
than four inches wide and within a few of them you can see the faint
glint of something metallic everytime the light hits them.
~
E
puddle~
The puddle of blood spans the width of the hallway here, covering every
inch of the floor and rising to a height of three inches.  Tiny bubbles
rise to the surface of the puddle occasionally and swirls can be seen
flowing upon its surface, as if something were breathing beneath it.
~
E
eastern skeletal remains humanoid~
The skeleton entombed within the eastern wall is covered in blood which
stands out against its blackened bones.  A pair of decaying eyes rest
within its eye sockets and pieces of flesh still cling from its skull. 
The skeleton's left arm is completely buried beneath the black obsidian
stone but his right arm, which slowly swings back and forth, hangs freely
from his shoulder.  Looking at the skull carefully you notice that a few
of its teeth are made of gold and silver.

Black Temple - Bloody Hallway~
A steady sheet of blood flows down the walls, rippling as it runs over
the cracks between each stone.  The air is filled with the overwhelming
stench of decaying flesh and its source appears to be a large mound of
decomposing flesh lying in the center of the hallway.  Almost hidden
beneath the waterfalls of blood you notice two reddish-colored iron
doors, covered with large metal seals, set into the east and west walls. 
The hallway continues to the north and south where you can hear the sound
of rushing water.

Large strips of decaying flesh litter the center of the hallway here,
stacked chaotically into a large mound.  Puddles of fresh blood still
cover the bits of flesh as does strands of black and gray hair.  From
beneath the mound of flesh you can see the hand of a skeleton with a
crimson and black ring attached to its finger, peeking out.  An
overwhelming stench of decay wafts up from the mound, mingling in the air
with the scent of fresh blood.
~
E
reddish-colored iron doors east west~
The doors are fairly small, barely high enough to allow a gnome-sized man
to pass through without ducking.  Various dents and scratches scar the
surface of the doors, each filled with a heavy layer of rust.  The doors
are void of handles or keyholes, making them impossible to open.  Upon
each door is a large @Wwhite seal@n which shimmers with a faint white
aura.
~
E
white seals~
The seal has been formed in the shape of a large tower shield and bears
the image of a phoenix with its wings outstretched upon it.  Several
small, clear crystals have been embedded along the edges of the seal and
glow with a pale blue light.  An aura of magic pulses around the border
of the seal but it does so very faintly as the magic has become weakened.

Black Temple - Beneath a Waterfall of Blood~
From a large crack running along the length of the ceiling a waterfall of
blood pours down upon the room, causing it to splatter against the walls
and yourself.  The puddle of blood on the bowl-shaped floor has
accumulated over time and nearly reaches your knees.  Painted onto the
westeren wall is a mural depicting worshippers of Morkith sacrificing
chalices of blood to their dark god.  A cube-shaped stone niche has been
carved into the western wall just beneath the mural; the hint of
something metallic shining from within it.

The niche has been carved into a cube shape measuring four inches by four
inches and its interior is coated with a slippery crimson ooze.  Within
the niche the glint of something metallic can be faintly seen every few
moments as light reaches it.
~
E
western wall mural~
The mural painted across the western wall depicts several black-robed
priests of Morkith impaling humans strapped to stone altars and draining
their blood into black iron chalices.  Some of the priests kneel before a
statue of Morkith behind the altar with their chalices raised toward it
while others drink the crimson fluid from them.  A river of blood flows
from the base of the altar and down beneath the priest's feet where it
collects into a large basin carved into the floor.  Within the basin you
notice the heads of a few elves floating along the surface.
~
E

The crack runs along the width of the ceiling and from within it a
waterfall of blood flows forth.  The crack is a mere three inches wide,
but the blood gushes out from it in great spurts.
~
E
waterfall blood~
The blood flowing from the crack falls like a waterfall, sending gushes
of it slapping against the floor and splattering everywhere.  An enormous
puddle has collected upon the floor, nearly reaching your knees from
where the waterfall drains out.  Tiny bits of flesh occasionally can be
seen falling along with the blood within the waterfall as it pours down.
~
E
puddle~
The puddle of blood is fairly deep due to the bowl-shaped depression
within the floor.  Bits of flesh float along its surface and tiny bubbles
occasionally rise to its surface, as if something beneath it were
breathing.

Black Temple - Hallway Intersection~
Unlit torches hang from the walls of the intersection here, each covered
in ages of dust and cobwebs.  Upon the ceiling an enormous mural has been
painted, depicting the dark god Morkith calling forth an army of
skeletons to raze a small elven village.  To the north lies a small,
brightly lit chamber in which you can see a large stone slab raised above
the floor.  To the east, west and south dark corridors make their way
through the ground floor of the temple.

ceiling mural painted~
Painted by expert hands, the mural depicts very realistically the dark
god Morkith summoning thousands of skeleton warriors towards a small
elven village.  Poised in front of the small thatch huts are several slim
elven archers and footmen.  High elven lords, mounted atop pegasi stand
in front of their troops with their war bows in hand, ready to repel the
invaders.  The small forest surrounding the village is abundant with
several sets of glowing red eyes which glare towards the elves.  Leading
the skeleton regiment is an imposing looking death knight clad in
midnight black armor and wielding a massive blood-stained pike.  The sky
above is filled with dark clouds which can be vaguely seen due to the
lack of moonlight but the ghostly image of Morkith appears hovering over
them, watching....waiting.

Black Temple - A Dark Corridor~
The dark obsidian walls of the corridor seem to absorb every bit of
light, making it impossible to see more than an arms-length in front of
you.  Unlit torches hang from the northern wall, covered in ages of
cobwebs and dust.  The remains of an intricate carving can be seen upon
the floor, although slabs of stone are missing making it hard to
recognize what it once depicted.  Set into the southern wall is a heavy
black iron door, covered in a large white seal.  To the east and west the
corridor continues to make its way around the temple.

~
E

The finely crafted tiled stone floor shows signs of ancient carvings that
once resided upon it, but time has taken its toll and many slabs of stone
have chipped away, making identification of the mural impossible. 
Examining it carefully you can barely recognize small figures which look
like armor-clad knights.

Black Temple - Dark Corridor~
The corridor is extremely dark and every bit of light is only able to
illuminate the chamber no more than a foot in front of you.  A single
stone pillar has been set against the northern wall, carved in the
likeness of a skeleton lunging out in attack.  Intricate black obsidian
arches covered in strange markings have been erected to the east and
south.  Dark hallways stretch out to the east, west and south from here,
continuing through the vast temple.

composed of black diamonds which glint in the light and appear as if the
statue were blinking.  The sword in the skeleton's hand is a finely
crafted broadsword and the creator left no detail out; the sword has been
replicated right down to the grooves on the pommel.  A cold wind blows
about the area of the pillar, chilling you to the bone.
~
E
intricate black obsidian arches~
The arches have been carved from highly-polished blocks of obsidian which
show no signs of blemishes whatsoever.  Strange markings have been etched
along each of the arches, although their meaning is foreign to you.  Only
one of the markings looks similar to something you've seen before and
that is the mark of Morkith, the ever-present open eye within a triangle.

Black Temple - Between a Pair of Entombed Skeletons~
The hallway here is filled waist-high with skulls and rib bones that
resemble those of humanoid beings.  Entombed in the eastern and western
walls are a pair of skeletons, each still wearing a suit of field
platemail which peeks out from within the rock.  Within the skeletons'
hands are long, razor-sharp scimitars which cross each other a few feet
above your head.  To the south and north the hallway continues into a
blanket of darkness.

Skulls and rib bones fill the hallway here, reaching up to your waist. 
The bones look like those from a humanoid species but their shape has
been warped, making true identification impossible.  Tiny teeth marks,

rotting flesh can been seen just beneath the surface of the mounds,
wafting an overwhelming stench of decay into the air.
~
E

Entombed within the east and west walls are a pair of skeletons still
wearing a suit of field platemail and holding scimitars up towards the
ceilings.  Only a quarter of the skeletons have been entombed within the
stone and their bones have been blackened as if burned by fire.  Within
the eyesockets of the skeletons are small red rubies which have been
firmly set into place.  The swords each skeleton wields cross each other
just above your head, forming an arch.  Within the rib cage of the
eastern skeleton you notice a portion of the stone is covered in cobwebs
but you can see something beneath them.
~
E
cage cobwebs stone~
Peering into the rib cage of the skeleton you notice a small outline of a

coats the skulls set into the walls of the corridor.  The skulls here
look fairly new, some still retaining their decaying eyes and others
still retaining all of their flesh and hair.  Sticking out of the western
and eastern walls are partially entombed shields and a few swords with
their blades pointed outwards.  Peering closely at the wall you notice a
few eyes within the skulls blink occasionally.  The corridor continues to
the north and south, along the wall of skulls.

east west walls skulls~
The skulls entombed in this section of hallway look as though they were
placed here recently as many of them still retain flesh and hair and eyes
still lie in the sockets of a few of them.  Each of the skull's mouths
have been locked open and look as if they were screaming.
~
E
shields swords~
The shields entombed within the walls have each been dyed a fiery orange
color and their edges lined with golden rivets.  The majority of the face
of the shields are hidden beneath the rock but you notice a design on its
surface which is nothing more than a few weaving lines.  The swords are
fairly new, covered in only a light layer of rust.  Their blades still
look extremely sharp and able to cut through bone and flesh easily.  The
swords in the east and west walls nearly touch each other due to the way
they were entombed, leaving anyone passing through the hallway to have to
weave and squeeze past them.

Black Temple - Along a Wall of Skulls~
The eastern and walls walls of this corridor are composed entirely of
humanoid skulls entombed in dark stone.  Bits of flesh still hang from a
few of the skulls, as if they were recently placed in the wall.  A puddle
of blood has collected just below the eastern wall, pouring out from the
eyesockets of a blackened skull.  A continuous, low moan, barely louder
than a whisper, rises up from within the walls.  To the north and south
the corridor continues through the temple.

walls eastern western~
The walls of this corridor are made up entirely of humanoid skulls which
have been entombed in the black obsidian stone.  Most of the skulls have
been stripped of some of their flesh, leaving only bleach-white bone, a
few strands of grey hair and small pieces of flesh.  Looking closely you
notice the eyes in a few of the skulls have rotted away, leaving only a
small lump of grey matter.  Within the eastern wall a blackened skull of
what looks to be a minotaur stands out from the rest as blood pours out
from its eyesockets.
~
E
puddle~
The puddle of blood spans the entire width of the hallway and slowly
edges its way southwards.  Following the stream of blood you see it spews
forth from the eyesockets of a blackened skull which resembles that of a
minotaur.
~
E
blackened skull minotaur~
The skull is amazingly larger than the others entombed in the wall and it
has been shaded a deep black.  Two sharp horns protrude from atop it and
gleam with a glint of fresh blood.  Its eyesockets are empty and within
them you can only see the stone in which the skull is entombed.  A steady
stream of blood flows from the mouth of the skull yet when you peer
inside it you cannot find anything that it could originate from.

Black Temple - A Dark Corridor~
Several unlit torches, each covered in a black mold, hang from the
southern wall of the corridor.  Carved into the center of the floor is
the image of a robed priest pointing toward the ceiling.  The
overwhelming stench of decaying flesh fills this section of the corridor. 
Thick cobwebs hang down from the ceiling, obscuring the passageways to
the east and north.  Hallways stretch out to the east, west and north
from here, continuing through the darkness of the temple.

torches~
Several unlit torches hang from the southern wall, each covered in a
block mold.  The thin strips of wood which compose the shaft of the
torches are splintered badly and warped, having been placed here quite
some time ago.  Tinder still rests within each of the torches but is
quite damp, making them quite useless.
~
E
black mold~
The black mold covers each of the torches and appears to have a corrosive
compound as it sizzles and slowly eats away at the wood.  Examining it
carefully you notice ripples run across its short, hair-like crust, as if
it were moving.
~
E
floor robed priest~
The carving upon the floor depicts a robe-priest with greenish-colored
diamonds for eyes pointing towards the ceiling.  Examining the carving
carefully you notice great care has been taken to recreate the person it
was modeled after; the wrinkles in his skin are clearly visible and even
a scar across his right eye has been made part of it.  Upon the left
cheek of the priest is a tattoo of a triangle with an eye in the center
of it.

Black Temple - A Dark Corridor~
Darkness envelops this section of the corridor, yet no amount of light
shed on the chamber illuminates it more than a few inches in front of you. 
The dark obsidian stones of the walls show no signs of blemishes, showing
the temple was built by very skilled hands.  The curved ceiling above you
has had a mural painted across its surface depicting a horde of skeletons
rushing a city resembling Medienne.  In the center of the southern wall a
single stone has been colored an ash-grey.  Set into the northern wall is
a heavy iron door, covered in a white seal.  To the east and west
corridors stretch out into different sections of the temple.

The mural depicts a legion of skeletal warriors rushing through a
grass-filled meadow and scaling over the walls of a city which resembles
that of Medienne far to the south.  Skeletons man heavy siege catapaults
as they bombard the helpless town and undead pikemen impale the guards of
the city as they charge blindly into the fray.  Amidst the haze of the
battle you see two figures standing atop the walls of the city, a tall
human wielding a large morningstar and a shadowy figure which resembles
nothing more than the outline of a human.
~
E
southern wall~
The sheer black obsidian stone of the southern wall has been crafted
perfectly, showing no signs of blemishes of imperfections except for a
discolored ash-grey stone which lies just a few feet above the base of
the wall.  The stone looks different from the others in both color and
shape.
~
E
discolored stone ash-grey~
The stone is significantly smaller then the other stones which make up
the wall, leaving a two inch gap between itself and the others.  It has
been shaded an ash-grey color and looking closely you notice in the
center of it the outline of a triangle has been etched into its surface.
~
E
heavy iron door~
The door is made from thick iron which is scarred with several dents. 
Examining it closely you notice the dents do not come from the outside
but rather from the inside.  Strapped across the door is a large
@b@Wwhite seal@n which shimmers faintly.
~
E
white seal~
The seal has been formed in the shape of a large tower shield and bears
the image of a phoenix with its wings outstretched upon it.  Several
small, clear crystals have been embedded along the edges of the seal and
glow with a pale blue light.  An aura of magic pulses around the border
of the seal but it does so very faintly as the magic has become weakened.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
Torches line the walls of this narrow hallway, their flames flickering
with a greenish flame.  Shadows dance across the walls and some seem to
have their own shape and move about at their own free will.  Ancient
runes and arcane glyphs have been carved into the floor and walls, each
pulsing with a purple light.  Set into the southern wall is a heavy steel
door, covered in splatters of fresh blood.  The hallway continues to the
east and west from here.

Each of the runes on the walls and floor are completely foreign to you,
their meaning lost centuries ago as the priests of the temple vanished. 
All of the runes are exactly the same as the others, a triangle bordered
by small black diamonds.  The symbols pulse with a fiery purple aura
which dims and brightens at its own free will.  Examining all of the
runes you notice one of them stands out from all the others.  It is
shaped like a phoenix with its wings outstretched and pulses with a
orange aura and a ray of light shines from within it and strikes the door
across the hall.
~
E
heavy steel door~
The door is fairly bulky and plated in many steel bands and steel rivets. 
Splatters of fresh blood cover the surface of the door and slowly trickle

Dark shapes move swiftly across the walls of the hallway, some taking on
the forms of clawed beasts.  Only silence fills the air of the temple and
not even the sound of sputtering torches can be heard.  Several intricate

with a crimson-colored liquid.  To the east and west the hallway
continues to remain lit by torches while to the south it is pitch black.

is composed of four oval-shaped runes which resemble an open eye.  The

depression, and three wiggly lines moving horizontally.

Black Temple - Slime Covered Corridor~
A large puddle of black slime, about three feet deep, fills this section
of the corridor.  Bubbles burst along the surface of the slime sending
white clouds of smoke into the air.  Ripples roll across the puddle, as
if something were underneath it, moving swiftly.  Lodged in the gaping
crack in the western wall of the corridor is a humanoid skull, covered in
black slime and a thick reddish liquid.  To the north the corridor
becomes brightly lit by a greenish glow, while to the south it remains
pitch black.

A wide crack runs along the length of the black obsidian ceiling; large
globs of black slime drop down from within it.  The black slime which
covers every bit of the corridor here sizzles loudly as it slowly eats at
the stone, as if it were acid.  Carved into the eastern wall, nearly
hidden beneath the ooze, is the outline of a small triangle.  Partially
buried in the stone wall on the western side of the corridor are several
small, shiny gems, each twinkling in the light.  To the north and south

Black Temple - Slime Covered Corridor~
The corridor is very narrow here, barely wide enough to allow a single
human-sized man to pass through.  Written down the eastern wall is a line
of ancient glyphs and writing, covered in ages of dust and grime.  The
slime in this section of the corridor is fairly deep, reaching nearly up
to your waist due to the bowl-shaped depression within the floor.  Above
you a large series of cobwebs, each filled with dead flies and maggots,
obscures the ceiling.  The corridor continues to the north and south
where a faint slurping noise can be heard.

The glyphs and writing upon the eastern wall are covered in ages of dust

completely foreign to you and you recognize none of the shapes or series
of lines which it is made up of.  Each of the glyphs glow with a very
faint yellow aura which can be barely seen from beneath the grime.  A
heavy presence of magic covers the writings and glyphs, which has allowed
them to withstand the test of time.

The cobwebs are thick and littered with the remains of dead flies and

cobwebs completely obscure the ceiling except for a small section of
black obsidian stone, curved and tiled by skilled hands.

the air.  The slime slowly drips off the walls and falls to the floor
where a large puddle has collected.
~
E
puddle~
The puddle spans the entire width of the hallway and proceeds down the
northern stretch of it.  Ripples run across its surface and tiny bubbles
rise to the top and burst, releasing a noxious gas.  Small, shiny objects
can be seen floating atop it, gleaming as the light hits the metallic
objects.  Fragments of bone lie along the edge of the pool but are
horribly disfigured and warped, making identification of the creature
they came from impossible.
~
E
fragments bone~
The fragments of bone are no more than two inches long and are horribly
warped, making identification of who they belong to impossible.  Each of
the bones has been eaten away by the ooze which it lies next to and small
holes scar its surface, making it resemble a sponge.  Sifting through the
pile you notice a few of the bones have teeth marks upon them that
resemble those made by a rat.

Black Temple - Between a Row of Pillars~
Massive obsidian pillars rise up along the edge of the corridor here,
supporting the curved stone ceiling.  Each of the pillars has been carved
in the likeness of a dark and sinister-looking cleric with his arms
raised skyward.  Tucked in between two pillars to the north is a small
iron door, covered in a large white seal.  To the west the hallway
proceeds into blackness while to the east it heads towards a faintly-lit
chamber.

These massive black obsidian pillars which support the curved ceiling
have been finely crafted leaving no signs of stone-working tools or
blemishes.  Each of the statues has been carved in the likeness of a
cleric garbed in long, flowing robes.  The eyes of statues are made from
red amethysts which twinkle in the light.  Every minute bit of detail was
given when the statues were created; each varies to reflect a different
priest varying between height and build.  Carved above the heads of the
statues are small triangles with a large eye, dyed blood-red and outlined
by small diamonds.

This small iron door is barely large enough to allow a dwarf-sized

Black Temple - Before a Sacrifical Altar~
Unlit dark steel braziers encrusted with several hundred red and green
bloodstones fill this circular room.  Within the center of the ring of
braziers stands a large black obsidian altar on which the decaying corpse
of a human lies, a wavy-bladed dagger impaled in his chest.  The western
wall has been painted with a magnificent mural of hordes of black and red
demons rushing through a swirling portal and assaulting a legion of
gnomes, elves, humans and dwarves.  Etched into the northern wall is a
large triangle with a blood-red colored eye in the center of it.  A small
stone shelf rests on the eastern wall on which several black iron
chalices rest.  To the south a hallway extends into the vast reaches of
the temple.

dark steel braziers~
These magnificent braziers have been molded from dark steel and has had
several red and green bloodstones embedded within it.  Each of the
bloodstones changes hues every few moments as the light from the flames
reflect off the smooth black obsidian walls and strike them.
~
E
black obsidian altar~
This large altar has been carved from two large slabs of black obsidian,
one forming its base while other having been laid across the top to form
the sacrifical table.  Ancient glyphs and runes have been etched around
the base of the altar although their meaning is unknown to you.  Attached
to each corner of the altar are sets of heavy steel shackles which are
stained with blood.  Lying sprawled out and locked in the shackles are
the decaying remains of human.
~
E
decaying remains human~
Emanating an overwhelming stench of decay and still oozing blood, the
decaying remains of this badly mutilated human is almost too ghastly to
look at it.  His legs and arms have been broken in several places and his
bleached-white bones stick out from beneath the slabs of greyish, rotting
skin.  His eyes have been cut from their sockets and placed next to his
head.  A wavy-bladed dagger has been implanted into his chest and looking
carefully you notice that his heart was torn from its cavity.
~
E
wavy-bladed dagger~
This black stone dagger has had its blade fashioned to resemble rippling
flames.  The hilt is composed of white ivory and has been molded into the
shape of a hunched-over demon.  A thick layer of dried blood coats every
inch of the dagger and bits of decaying flesh still cling to it.
~
E
western wall mural~
The mural depicts in graphic detail several red and black dragons flying
through a swirling purple and silver portal and assaulting several
regiments of gnomish infantry, elven archers, human pikemen and dwarven
berserkers.  The gnomish regiments battle hand-to-hand with the red
dragons and before them lie several dead dragons alongside at least a
hundred dead gnomes.  The archers stand at the edge of a heavily-wooded
forest unloading barrage after barrage of flaming arrows which strike the
black dragons.  The humans and dwarves battle alongside each other trying
vainly to repel a massive black dragon which is much larger than all the
others.  Scattered about the battlefield are thousands of the slain
defenders and only five dragons.
~
E
northern wall triangle blood-red eye morkith~
Covering the entire northern wall is a carving of a large blood-red eye
in the center of a triangle.  The eye itself is composed of red rubies
while the pupil is one giant black diamond.  The triangle has been
bordered with red bloodstones which have been cracked and a few shattered
into small fragments and now lie upon the floor.
~
E
shelf eastern wall~
This crude stone shelf has been made from a slab of grey stone which is
covered in droplets of dried blood.  Several black iron chalices, filled
to their rims with blood, rest along the shelf.  A larger, gem-encrusted
chalice sits in the middle of the smaller ones and within it rests a
human heart which still beats slowly.

This dark, secluded alcove houses a small dark stone staircase which
spirals up to an opening in the ceiling and then out of sight.  Etched
into the walls are small carvings that resemble sword-wielding knights
rushing a legion of demons.  Upon the northern wall hangs a tattered silk
tapestry depicting a grotesque scene of demons impaling knights on their
own spears.  A small puddle of blood has collected on the floor where it
slowly drains into a small hole, no bigger than your fist, on the western
side of the room.  To the south the wall is scarred by several cracks and
niches.

edges of the walls are several humanoid leg and arm bones, some intact
while others have been shattered into small fragments.  In the center of
the room a dark stone staircase spirals down and out of view, heading to
the lower levels of the temple.  A large, elegantly carved adamantite
arch, adorned with various carvings and ancient writings lies directly to
the south, leading into utter darkness.

Black Temple - Entombed Within Walls of Stone~
This cubical chamber is quite small, measuring only about four by four
feet and retains an unnatural silence.  Smooth black stone walls rise up
in all directions around you, leaving no visible exits in sight.  Stone
niches have been carved into each of the walls, each containing a small,
metallic object.  Runes of protection, each shedding no light or magical
aura, have been etched into the south, east and west walls.  In the
center of each wall a block of stone has been discolored, giving way to
an ash-grey color rather than the midnight black stone which surrounds
them.

Black scorch marks scar the grey stone walls of the hallway, testament to
a massive fire that swept through the temple.  The charred remains of
several humanoids lie scattered about the floor; their flesh completely
burned away leaving only pitch-black bones.  Suits of partially melted
scale armor lie along the side of the hallway, surrounded by a pool of
hardened iron.  The remains of torches hang from the eastern and southern
walls; reduced to nothing more than mere charred sticks.  To the west the
hallway continues toward a large mound of ash while to the north it leads
into darkness.

Standing against the western wall are the soot-covered remains of a

bordering the hallway has several small diamonds embedded within it which
twinkile in the light.  To the east and south the hallway continues,

footprints can be clearly seen upon the floor, some resembling those of a
humanoid while others are completely foreign to you.  To the east a small
ray of white light breaks through the darkness of the hallway while to
the south it remains black.

This small chamber of the hallway is in perfect condition, almost as if
the fire never touched this section.  The walls are barren of any
fixtures or decorations except for small gems which have been embedded in
the stone.  Lying sprawled out in the center of the floor are the remains
of a knight clad in ivory-white armor; his hand still grasping a
shimmering white broadsword which illuminates the hallway.  A pool of
fresh blood surrounds the knight and looking carefully a message has been
written across the floor next to it.  A strange aura of magic fills the
air and creates a sense of peace and tranquility.  Despite the light
emanating from the broadsword the hallway to the north and east remains
pitch black.

Set into the smooth stone floor of the chamber are several iron pikes on
which hang the remains of several slain knights.  Bits of decaying flesh
lie scattered beneath each of the knights and blood slowly trickles off
of their gaping wounds and onto the floor where a massive puddle has
collected spanning from wall to wall.  A few of the knights appear as if
they died quite recently as none of their flesh has decayed and their
faces still retain color instead of the pale complextion of death.  To
the west another chamber opens up from which rays of bright white light
can be seen while to the north it becomes more dimly light.

Black Temple - Worshipping Chamber~
The walls of this section of the chamber have several white glowing runes
etched into them.  The body of a lone, black-robed priest bearing the
mark of Morkith lies before the runes with his hand outstretched toward
the runes.  Off to the east a bright light breaks through the darkness.

Black Temple - Worshipping Chamber~
The black obsidian walls are scarred by several deep niches and cuts made
by what you think could be swords, axes and other edged weapons.  Bits
and pieces of white armor lie upon the floor looking as if its user
abandoned it in a hurry.  A lone holy symbol lies upon the floor, giving
off a faint white glow.

Black Temple - Before the Shrine of Morkith~
Lieing along the southern wall is a huge shrine made entirely from bones
of long dead humanoids.  Black tallow candles cover the surface
flickering with an almost black-colored flame.  Several goblets and
chalices sit along a crude ledge on the shrine as drops of blood trickle
slowly into them seemingly from nowhere.  Just above the shrine a statue
of the black god Morkith looms over the room casting a black shadow.  A
crude stone altar runs along the base of the shrine covered with blood
from past sacrifices.

The black chalices and goblets are made from the purest obsidian you have

The eastern wall bears no exciting features or decorations except for a
lone tapestry depicting a robed figure with his arms raised toward the
sky.  Upon the floor a a pile of bread and a few chalices of water lie
untouched, possibly a test to the worshippers faith in Morkith providing
for them.

A shelf has been carved into the eastern wall and is covered in several

eye has been carved in the wall just above the shelf and as the light

There is nothing special about this section of the chamber except for a

statue dark god Morkith~
The statue depicts the black god morkith with a menacing look on his face. 
The eyes of the statue glow with unnatural red fire as they gaze down
upon you.  The tips of his horns atop his head glisten with what looks to
be fresh blood.
~
E
altar~
The altar is made entirely of black obsidian which glistens in the light. 
Large splatters of blood cover its surface suggesting a recent sacrifice
has taken place.  Deep scores made by what could be a bladed weapon scar
the edges of the altar.  Leg and arm shackles lay on each corner, slick
with fresh blood.
~
E
corpse human~
The corpse is of a recently dead human who seems to have the unfortunate
luck of finding his way into the clutches of Morkith's minions.  A deep
cut runs down from the top of his chest to his bottom of his stomach and
looking closely you notice that his heart is missing and nowhere to be
found.

Knee-high brown grass fills this section of the hallway, rising up
through the seams between each of the stones in the floor.  Thick,
tangled vines drape down from cracks in the ceiling, obscuring your field
of vision to the north.  Leaning across the hallway just before the start
of its run to the north is a massive stone pillar, scarred by large
cracks and covered in black moss.  The hallway continues to the north
where it is completely overgrown while to the west it remains clear.

knee-high grass brown~
The grass reaches your knees and although it is brown and withering it
still clings to life.  Each of the thin strands breaks its way through
the seams of the stones in the floor.  The patches of grass sway gently
back and forth, as if a gently breeze were blowing.
~
E
tangled vines~
This thick mass of tangled vines is nothing more than a nuisance as it
constantly block your field of vision down the hallway and bars your
passage.  A few of the vines remain alive blooming with white flowers,
while others bear the brown and withered appearence of death.
~
E
stone pillar~
The pillar is nothing more than a huge block of grey stone save for the
fact that it bears small glyphs upon its surface which glow with a faint
red glow.  Some of the glyphs across the pillar do not shed a glow as
they have been broken in two by the large cracks with cover the stone
surface.  Patches of black moss with short, dog-like hairs, cling to the
pillar; a crackling sound emanates from within it.
~
E
black moss~
Althought the moss appears as any other common moss one would see on a
tree or ancient dwelling, this species stands out with its pitch-black
color and short hairs.  A crackling sound emanates from the patches of
moss and looking closely you see the source; the moss has begun to slowly
eat away at the stone it clings to.
~
E
glyphs~
These intricately carved glyphs have withstood the test of time and
managed to survive the destruction brought onto the hallway.  Each glyph
pulses with a faint red aura which dims and brightens at its own free
will.  Looking carefully at each of them you notice a few have been
broken and black scorch marks can be clearly seen around them.

Black Temple - Overgrown Hallway~
Mass tangles of withered vines cover every inch of the floor, walls and
ceiling of this section of hallway.  Stone pillars which once supported
the elegant curved stone ceiling have collapsed and shattered in small
pieces and now litter the floor.  Gigantic roots, like those of a Shuvana
wood tree, snake their way up through large holes in the floor and nearly
block off the hallway completely with their mass.  To the north you can
faintly see a mound of stone debris littering the hallway while to the
south it looks to be overgrown heavily with vegetation.

tangles vines withered~
The vines are thick and tangled around each other, creating a near
inpenetrable wall.  Each of the vines is brown and withered but blotches
of green can still be seen upon their surface.  Looking closely you
notice small, reddish-colored buds upon each of the vines.
~
E
pillars~
Once these mighty stone beams were used to support the massive curved
stone ceiling of the time, but time and the constant weight of the
ceiling have brought them down.  Only small blocks of the stone remain;
the intricate carvings which cover the fragments are too destroyed to
tell what they once depicted.
~
E
shuvana gigantic roots~
These massive roots look identical to those of a Shuvana wood tree.  Each
root is partially entombed in the stone floor, leaving only about four
feet of it showing.  Patches of its thick, dark grey bark are missing
revealing the cream-colored wood beneath it.  Upon the face of the root
are several gashes, like those made by a extremely sharp axe.

Black Temple - Along a Collapsed Hallway~
Portions of the eastern and western walls of the hallway have collapsed
here, leaving mounds of crumbled stone six feet high lying in the center
of the passage.  Thick patches of black moss cover the mounds of stones
and portions of the walls that still stand.  A hole in the western wall
gives way to a small bead of light which dims and brightens of its own
free will.  The ceiling is scarred by large, wide cracks and large
sections of its stone have crumbled away.

mounds crumbled stone~
The mound of stone debris fills the entire width of the hallway and rises
up about six feet, leaving only a foot gap between itself and the ceiling. 
The large blocks of stone are scarred with cracks and chipped severely. 
Examining the mound carefully you notice the arm bone of some creature
sticking out from beneath it.  Nearly obscured from the veil of darkness
covering the corridor, you spot a small gap on the western edge of the
mound, allowing barely enough room for a human-sized man to pass through
sideways.
~
E
patches black moss~
The moss is quite thick and has a pitch-black color to it.  Ripples run
across its short hair-like tendrils like a soft breeze were blowing. 
Small tendrils of smoke waft up from beneath the moss and a faint
sizzling sound can be faintly heard.
~
E
hole western wall gap~
The hole is no more than the size of an ogre's fist and it is utterly
pitch-black within it except for a small pin-point of white light which
glows softly.  The sound of rushing water can be heard from within the
bowels of the hole.
~
E
bead light ball~
Straining your eyes you peer into the hole to see a small bead of soft
glowing white light, no large than the size of a pebble, floating quietly
in mid-air.  Its form ripples with magic and distorts its actual shape. 
Occasionally the ball brightens and then dims itself, as if of its own
free will.

Black Temple - Overgrown Hallway~
Mounds of crumbled stone blocks, leaning pillars covered in tangled
vines, and large roots fill this narrow section of hallway.  Large
sections of stone in the eastern wall have crumbled away, revealing
large, dark holes from within which glints of something metallic can
occasionally be seen.  A large crack runs down the length of the ceiling
from which large, thick vines drape down to the floor.  To the north and
south the hallway continues through the corridors of the temple.

mounds crumble stone blocks~
These large blocks of stone are the remnants of sections of the eastern
which have broken free over time.  Most of the stone has shattered into
small chunks while only a few still remain whole.  Upon the surface of a
few of the blocks are small, circular indentations which have been filled
with a fine golden powder.  Looking closely you notice that the
indentations are about the size of a small pearl and seemingly serve no
purpose.
~
E
pillars~
These once magnificent pillars are now nothing more than mere slabs of
deteriorated stone.  Large cracks scar their surface and thick, twisting
vines have wrapped themselves around the stone in a strangling grasp. 
Other than the cracks, the pillars are void of any markings, carvings or
decorations.
~
E
eastern wall~
Most of the eastern wall has crumbled away, leaving only large, gaping
holes in its place.  From within the depths of the holes you can
occasionally see a glint of something metallic shining deep within it. 
From deep down within the bowels of the hole you can hear the faint sound
of dripping water.
~
E
crack ceiling vines~
The crack spans the width of the ceiling and from within it several thick
vines have worked their through it and drape down, nearly touching the
floor.  The vines are brown and brittle to the touch although some of
them have small, green buds growing along their surface.

Black Temple - Overgrown Hallway~
Large, twisted vines, snaking their way out from within cracks in the
ceiling, floor, and walls, cover every inch of the hallway here. 
Decaying roots, like that of a tree, bulge up from the hallway floor,
nearly blocking the path to the south.  Upon the eastern wall, nearly
obscured by a thick layer of vines, is a carving of a triangle.  To the
south the hallway continues through the jungle of overgrowth while to the
west it is clear.

eastern wall carving~
Upon the eastern wall, nearly obscured by several layers of draping
vines, is the faint outline of a triangle-shaped carving.  Outlining the
carving are several small, coin-sized red rubies which glint in the light. 
Around the edges of the rubies small writing has been scratched into the
stone, but has been eroded quite badly and is barely readable.
~
E
writing~
The writing is so small it is incredible hard to read and you have to
strain your eyes to decipher the few bits which still remain which read:
@W"D.  .ot ..pen the cham....  for w.at li.s w.i..in w.ll destr..

~
E
decaying roots floor~
The roots are incredibly large, nearly the size of hill giant's waist. 
Bits and pieces of their outer bark have been sliced away revealing the
cream-colored, moist wood.  The bulges increase more to the south where
they nearly block off passage down that section of hallway.
~
E
twisted vines cracks~
Withered, brown and quite brittle, the vines still seem to serve as a
nuisance as they continually get in your way.  The tips of the vines
touching the floor have tangled with each other.  A few of the vines have
become petrified and are solid as stone and fragments of their bark have
been sheered off making nasty, razor-like obstructions.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
The hallway turns sharply at a ninety degree angle here, yet the shadows
that continually dance across the wall do not bend as they approach the
turn.  Lying in the center of the floor are the skeletal remains of three
heavily-armored knights; each of their skulls has been shattered into
small fragments.  Carved into the western wall is a small cubical niche,
in which a rusty iron goblet rests.  To the east and south south a line
of torches can be seen hanging from the walls of the hallway, flickering
with green flames.

skeletal remains heavily-armored knights~
Sprawled out before you are the remains of three knights clad in suits of
heavy platemail.  Each of the knight's skulls have been crushed leaving
only a few fragments of bone.  Their bones have been completely stripped
of all flesh and only a few scattered cobwebs now cover them.  Looking at
their armor you notice it bears the image of a phoenix upon its crest.
~
E
west wall niche cubical~
The niche is fairly large, measuring twelve inches high by twelve inches
wide.  Its interior is quite smooth and highly polished, causing the
light to reflect off it intensely.  Within the niche rests a large, rusty
iron goblet which has several rubies embedded around its lip.
~
E
rusty iron goblet~
The goblet is the same as those used in church services save for the fact
that this one is made of black iron and its lip is bordered by red blood
rubies.  Small runes have been etched across its surface which are
outlined by a light gold powder.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
The greenish-glow emitted by the torches hanging from the walls causes
the hallway to darken as it strikes the black obsidian walls.  From
within various cracks in the walls you can hear the faint sound of water
dripping as it echoes off in the distance.  The entire surface of the
floor is covered in a thin layer of a reddish-colored sticky goo which
constantly tries to hold you to the floor every time you attempt to move. 
To the north and south the long hallway continues.

torches~
Each of the torches look like any other you have seen save for the fact
that these burn with a green flame which causes the hallway to become
bathed in a soft green glow.  Looking closely you notice the torches bear
small runes on their shafts but their meaning is unknown to you.
~
E
cracks walls~
Various cracks run along the surface of the walls, some paper thin while
others are large enough to slip ones hand through.  The sound of dripping
water can be heard deep within the bowels of the cracks and listening
carefully you hear a faint roaring sound, like that of a rushing river.
~
E
floor reddish-colored goo~
Examining the floor closely you notice it is covered with a very thick
layer of blood which is quite sticky, causing your feet to stick to the
stone everytime you attempt to move.  Ripples run across the surface of
the blood and bubbles occasionally rise to its surface, like something
were breathing beneath it.  Looking around you cannot find any source for
the blood and despite the hallway's gentle sloping downwards to the
south, it does not trickle in that direction.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
The ever-present shadows dancing across the length of the hallway take on
on humanoid forms while others take on the shapes of chimeras and
multi-headed four-legged beasts.  Peeking out from within the stonework
of the eastern and western walls are skeletal hands covered in fresh
blood.  Lying along the side of the hallway are several sets of black
robes, each clearly bearing the mark of Morkith upon them.  The hallway
continues to the north and south, through the vast corridors of the
temple.

The skeletal hands have been entombed within the black obsidian stone and
only half the finger bones peek out.  A thick layer of flesh blood covers
the bones and slowly drips onto the floor.  Upon one of the hands is a
black diamond ring cut into a smooth oval and a single rune has been
etched into its face.

Made from thick, black velvet, these robes are the traditional garment of
Morkith's minions.  Embroidered with silver thread upon the right breast
is the mark of Morkith; a triangle with a blood-red eye in its center. 
Each of the robes has a thick crust of dry blood over it along with spots
of mildew and grime.
~
E
diamond ring~
The ring is made from blue electrum topped with a oval-cut black diamond. 
Etched into the center of the diamond is a small rune shaped like a 'S'
with a line down the center.  The rune glows very faintly with a white
aura which pulses in and out every few moments.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
An intricate obsidian arch, covered in shimmering runes and finely
detailed carvings, crosses over this part of the hallway.  Carved into
the smooth stone floor is a mural depicting an extremely large horned
demon surrounded by thousands of skeletal warriors in plate armor.  Small
hand-sized niches have been carved into the eastern wall which continue
traight up the curved ceiling, ending at a part of stone that has been
discolored.  The hallway continues to make its way throughout the temple
to the north and south from here.

intricate obsidian arch~
The massive arch has been crafted of black obsidian which has streaks of
grey running through it.  Several flowing runes, each pulsing with a
different color of light, have been etched across the surface of the arch. 
Small carvings, depicting many fiendish monsters from wights to
three-headed demons, cover the surface of the arch.  Emebedded directly
in the center of the arch, at its very peak, rests a large blood-red
diamond which glints in the light.
~
E
floor mural~
The mural has painted in great detail; every minute detail possible has
been added.  Thousands of skeletal warriors march in ranks away from a
razed village.  The orange columns of flame blazing illuminate the
landscape around the village which looks to be a dense forest.  In the
center of the army of skeletons is a large horned demon with red and
black scales.  The demon carries a large stake, topped with the head of
an elf, in one hand and large broadsword in the other.  West of the
skeleton horde are several dozen groups of elven archers, pikemen and
calvary rushing towards the burning village.  Looking closely at the
mural you notice in the lower left hand corner of it a small man, dressed
in white armor looms over the corpses of five red demons.  The knight's
features are obscured by the blackness of the night.  Painted upon his
armor is the tiny emblem of a phoenix.
~
E
eastern wall niches~
The small niches are just large enough to fit your hand in and are slick
with deposits of water.  The niches climb straight up the wall and
towards a block of discolored stone in the ceiling and come to abrupt
stop just before it.
~
E
ceiling stone discolored~
A small block of stone within the ceiling is discolored to a dull grey
color.  The edges of the stone are chipped severely as if someone
attempted to pry the stone free.  The mortar which was used to hold it in
place is completely gone, leaving only a half inch gap between it and the
rest of the stones but remarkably, it has not break free from its own
weight.

Black Temple - Flickering Hallway~
Two torches hang from the southern wall of the hallway here, one blazing
with a greenish flame while the other remains unlit.  Carved just beneath
the unlit torch are several ancient writings which have partially eroded
over time, making them barely readable.  A few of the stones within the
western wall have been colored an ash-grey, standing out from the black
obsidian which surround them.  Directly to the east the passage is pitch
black and you can hear a squishing sound from that direction.  To the
north the lit section of the hallway continues.

Embedded in the wall between the torches is a giant blue sapphire which

The sapphire is extremely larger then any other you have ever seen before
and has been cut into the shape of a triangle.  The left side of the
sapphire is a light sky-blue color while the right is a deep, midnight

Black Temple - Chamber of Horrors~
The walls of this circular stone chamber are covered in a thick layer of
blood which slowly oozes out from within cracks between the stones. 
Mounds of decomposing corpses litter the floor, each giving off an
overwhelming stench of decay.  In the center of the room a silvery powder
has been sprinkled into the form of a small circle and lying within it is
the corpse of a robed humanoid; his face frozen with a look of horror. 
Set into the southern wall is a small iron door covered in splatters of
dried blood.

The walls of this circular chamber are made of a smooth grey stone.  The

them ooze with fresh blood.  The blood has collected along the base of
the wall where it slowly drains down through cracks in the floor.
~
E
mounds decomposing corpses~
An overwhelming stench of decay wafts up from the mounds of corpses which
litter the floor.  Looking closely you notice the mounds contain the
corpses of elves, gnomes, humans and a few lizardmen.  Each of the
corpses has been horribly battered and mutilated almost beyond
recognizition.  Blood still oozes from the wounds of a few of the corpses
while others have barely any flesh left on their bones.
~
E
silvery powder circle~
The circle surrounding the powder has been formed with a silvery-white
powder which twinkles in the light.  Along the interior of the circle is
a thick crimson ooze which forms a smaller, inner circle.  Bordering the
edges of the silver powder is an ash-grey powder in which you can see
bits of bone lying just beneath its surface.  A strong magical aura
emanates from the circle and seems to push you away from it.
~
E
robed humanoid~
Sprawled out in the center of the circle is the decaying corpse of a
robed human.  The flesh upon his face has decayed except for a few bits
which still cling to the bleach-white bone.  A look of horror is frozen
upon his face, as if he had seen something so terrible that would make a
man die from fright.  His arms and legs have been broken and several
places and the sharp edges of them break through his robe and the flesh
which still remains on his bones.  Looking closely you notice that his
robe, although moth-eaten and tattered, still bears the mark of Morkith
upon it.

This small iron door is scarred with several dents which were made from

This small, cubical stone chamber is made from a darkish-colored granite. 
Several glyphs and runes of binding cover the walls, a few pulsing with

is the skeleton of a disfigured humanoid, draped in dark robes.  Within
the skeleton's hand is a large mithril mace which he still grasps tightly.

dark and void of their magical properties used to bind a being to a

Looking at each of them carefully you notice that someone has tried to

runes.

The skeleton is draped in long, flowing dark robes covered in tiny
diamonds.  Most of its bones have been crushed or snapped in two leaving
only a leg, arm and three rib bones intact.  The skull of the being is
completely shattered and only a few small plates still remain.  Examining
it carefully you notice the bones that are still intact are warped and
disfigured horribly.  Still clutched in the skeleton's hand is a large
mithril mace studded with red rubies.
~
E

The mace has been finely crafted into the shape of a wailing demon.  Two

Black Temple - Chamber of Pain~
Dozens of iron and steel shackles have been hammered into the walls of
this triangular-shaped stone chamber.  Dangling from within the shackles
are several human corpses, each scarred by bone-deep cuts and shattered
bones.  In the center of the room is a large wooden rack, on which lies
the decaying remains of a robed humanoid.  In each corner of the chamber
are rusty iron maidens; each slightly open revealing a mutilated corpse
still entomed within them.  Set into the eastern wall is a small door
covered in centuries of dust and cobwebs.

once locked into them.  Red-brown droplets of dried blood can be clearly
seen on each set of shackles and bits of dried and decomposing flesh
still cling to a few of them.  The skeletal remains of several humans
still hang from the shackles; their bones scarred by deep sword-cuts and
even more have been shattered.

The skeletons still dangling from the shackles have been severely
mutilated; their arm and leg bones are scarred with deep cuts made by a

This large, wooden torture device is covered in dried blood stones and

and stretch the victim is covered in rust and looks like it could fall
apart at any moment.
~
E
robed humanoid~
The remains of a dark priest lie chained to the wooden rack in the center
of the chamber.  His flesh is almost completely gone, leaving only
bleached-white bone in its place.  His eyes are nothing more than a small
lump of greyish-goo which maggots crawl across.  Bits of his black velvet
robe, riddled with holes and tattered badly, still cling to his rib bones. 
Upon his hand is a large steel ring shaped to resemble a screaming skull.

These massive iron coffins are covered in several centuries of dust and

which are covered in dried blood.  Within each of the iron maidens the
horribly mutilated remains of armored mountain elves; each riddled with
holes which ooze fresh blood.  The flesh of each elf has slowly
decomposed over many years but instead of falling off it has turned a
pale grey color and sunken down towards the bones; as if it were embalmed

skulls which have been entombed within the stone.  The skulls represent

and screams of agony and pain fill the chamber yet you see no place from

with a dagger implanted into his chest.  To the west a small iron door,

The skulls entombed within the walls of the chamber are from various
races ranging from gnomes to those of lizardmen.  Each of the skulls has
been molded into the stone of the wall and their jaws left wide open, as
if they were screaming.  Looking closely you notice some of them still
retain decaying eyes within their eyesockets while in others there is
nothing but a mere pile of ash.
~
E
crude stone altar~
Composed of a single slab of black quartz and shaped in a crude manner,
the altar is bare of any decorations or shrines devoting it to a god. 
Dark red blood stains cover the flat surface of the altar, some fairly
new while others take on the red-brown appearance from ages of being
exposed to air.  Lying sprawled out atop the altar are the decomposing
remains of a robed priest who has a wavy-bladed dagger impaled in his
chest.
~
E
robed human priest decomposing remains~
Scarred by gaping wounds which sink down toward his bleached white bones,
this priest of Morkith suffered a gruesome death.  Several of his bones
have been snapped and his eyes have been cut out.  The flesh which still
remains on his bones is covered in deep black and blue bruises; his neck
has been severed by a long slice running from ear to ear.  His black
velvet robe is mottled and riddled with holes from which sharp shards of
bone peak out above.  A dagger has been impaled in his chest, piercing
his heart where bits of it can still be seen.

Black Temple - Chamber of Death~
Enormous dark silk tapestries, each depicting gruesome rituals of
sacrifice and battles between dark robed clerics and elven archers, adorn
the black stone walls of this large chamber.  Scattered about the floor
are several maces, swords, pikes and axes, covered in blood and rust. 
Painted onto the southern wall is a ghastly mural displaying a horned
demon feasting on the remains of several slain elves.  Hovering just
below the ceiling is a small silvery rune which pulses with a red-green
light.  Directly to the north stands a heavy black iron door.

enormous dark silk tapestries~
The tapestries are composed of sheets of dark silk embroidered with
multi-colored thread which stands out against the background.  Each
tapestry depicts a horrific scene of death: battles between elves and
robed priests and acts of human sacrifice.  The tapestry of the battle of
elves and priests hangs serenly from the @Wwestern wall@n while the mural
of sacrificial rituals hangs from the @Weastern wall@n.
~
E
eastern wall~
This tapestry depicts black-robed priests of Morkith sacrificing captured
knights to their dark god.  Six stone altars form a circle around a pool
of blood and strapped to the altars are two elves, three humans and a
dwarf.  The priests hold sacrifical daggers high above their heads, ready
to strike them down into the chests of their victims.  The basin of blood
in the center of the ring of altars swirls and churns as if something
beneath the surface were moving and looking closely you can see humanoid
skulls floating in it.  Looking closely you notice a tall, dark-skinned
female vyan kneeling near the basin, drinking the blood which swirls
within it.
~
E
western wall~
Battalions of elven archers and black-robed clerics clash in a dark
forest depicted in this mural.  The horribly mutilated bodies of elven
warriors litter the ground and pools of blood can be clearly seen between
each corpse.  Vultures rest atop the chests of the slain evils, pecking
away at their decaying flesh.  The hordes of elven archers kneel upon
their ground in front of a row of pikemen and swordsman as the masses of
dark clerics come charging into the fray.  In the top left hand corner of
the tapestry a smaller battle is shown between elven pikemen and fearsome
looking demons.  A few of the elves have managed to impale the demons
upon their pikes but in the process several demons have torn gaping holes
in the chests of the elves.  In the midst of the raging battles the hazy,
transparent image of a sinister-looking horned demon hovers above the
treeline, looking down at the mass destruction.
~
E
maces swords pikes axes~
Lying scattered about the floor of the chamber are several dozen maces,
swords, pikes and axes, each made from a different type of metal and
covered in dried blood and rust.  Most of the weapons have broken in two
or rusted beyond any repair but some still gleam like the day they were
first made.
~
E
southern mural flesh feast~
Painted in black and crimson pigments, the mural upon the southern wall
depicts a grotesque scene of a large black-skinned demon kneeling in the
center of a forest grove, devouring the corpses of slain elves.  All
about the clearing, corpses of elven archers and swordsman lie in heaps,
each oozing blood from deep wounds across their bodies.  The demon has
his claws stuck deep into the stomach of one of the elves; whose face is
frozen with a look of unimaginable agony.  Bits of flesh hang from the
demons mouth and blood trickles down his polished black scales.  Almost
hidden among the bodies, you can see several more demons tearing the
fallen elven heroes limb from limb, and devouring their flesh in large
quantities.
~
E
small silvery rune~
The rune is the shape of an oval with tiny stars scattered across its
surface.  Its silvery color gleams in the light and reflects the
red-green aura which pulses around it about the room.  A beam of light
from the rune shines down and hits the door set into the northern wall
where an aura of magic emanates.

Black Temple - Chamber of Nightmares~
Black iron candle racks, filled with black tallow candles that flicker
with a dim yellow light, sit along the eastern and western walls of this
large stone chamber.  Shadows dance across the walls of the chamber, some
moving at their own free will and taking on shapes of clawed beasts and
multi-headed giants.  In the center of the room stands a small wooden
pedestal on which a massive book, bound with the flesh of a human sits. 
Set into the southern wall is a small crypt on which writing can be seen
beneath several years of dust.  To the north a heavy steel door, covered
with a large white and crimson seal, marks the exit out of the chamber.

Black Temple - Entrance to the Hall of Demons~
Sheer black obsidian walls rise up to the north and south of the corridor
here, completely void of any blemishes or inperfections.  Twin arches,
made of polished dark grey adamantite and covered with ancient glyphs and
runes, lie directly to the east and west.  The sound of sputtering can be
heard off to the west where the hallway is illuminated faintly and
abundant with dancing shadows.  To the east the hallway proceeds into
darkness and not even your own light seems to break through it.

have been stacked into a neat pile and a single crimson candle rests atop

Two enormous statues dominate the eastern and western walls of the
hallway here, each resembling a cross between a dragon and a human. 
Beside each of the statues are small niches in which several tied up
scrolls and dust-covered tomes rest.  Carved into the floor of the
hallway is the image of a giant eye placed in the center of a triangle. 
Upon the ceiling a mural made with red and black dye has been painted,
depicting a legion of demons marching towards a city that strikingly
resembles Vaasa.  To the north and south the hallway stretches through
the temple along the hordes of statues.

Several dozen small statues line the walls of the passage here, each

Pools of blood rest before each of the statues which constantly churns
violently, like it were concious and aware of its surroundings.  Upon the
eastern wall, etched just above the heads of the statues, is a large
carving of a man draped in robes which only reveal his skeletal hands. 
To the north the hallways continues through the rows of statues while to
the south it bends out of view.

The hallway bends sharply here, heading off through a triangle-shaped
opening in the wall to the west.  Only a lone statue, carved to look like
like a medusa, has been erected in this section of the passage, which
stands directly before the opening to the west.  Upon the southern wall
are several patches of discolored stone on which partial remains of
ancient writing remains.  The eastern wall is completely bare save for a
tiny hand-sized niche which has been placed dead center in the wall.  The

statues of demons.  A massive silk tapestry depicting a lone knight clad
in pitch-black armor surveying a battle between demons and dwarves from
high atop a hill.  To the east a triangle-shaped opening has been carved
through the wall and on the other side you can see the faint outline of a
huge statue dominating the center of the hallway.  To the north and east

Massive spider webs drape across the walls of the corridor here,
completely obscuring your field of vision to the east.  Beneath the many
layers of silken thread upon the walls you can see the faint outlines of
large stone carvings but are too obscured to identify what they represent. 
Within a section of webbing on the southern wall are several entombed
sword spiders, partially eaten and decayed.  To the south lies a dented
steel has been nearly obscured by the webs.  A grey-white marble arch,
covered in glowing runes and glyphs lies to the west while to the east
the corridor continues through the sheets of cobwebs.

The massive silken threads of the cobwebs in this section of the hallway

webs have become strengthened by each other and feel as if they were made
of stone.  Upon the northern wall, stuck beneath several layers of
webbing, are the skeletal remains of a humanoid clad in white armor. 
Small rats and large spiders can be seen stuck within the crossections of
the webs; their flesh nearly gone and white bone visible.  A rickety
wooden door, covered in rusty steel bands, lies directly to the south. 
The hallway continues to the east and west from here.

rubble lie in the corners of the room having broken free from the ceiling
and walls.  The southern wall shows evidence that the chamber was once
occupied as you can see the faint outline of what could have been a
picture frame.  Although barren of any furnishing, one hint of former
inhabitance still remains; the decaying corpse of a black robed figure
sits slumped over in the southwest corner of the room.  Set into the

An overwhelming stench of burnt and decaying flesh fills the air here,
mingling with the strong smell of soot.  Strewn about the floor in heaps
are the remains of several dozen horribly burned humanoids, some still
wearing their armor they doned in battle.  A large, crudely formed block
of steel lies in the southwest corner of the room; the blade-end of a
steel longsword partially melted into it.  Set against the southern wall
is a small stone altar on which the blackened bones of a human lie
strapped to it.  Lying beside the altar is a bulky suit of field plate
armor, covered in blood and rittled with holes.  To the north the hallway
continues through the vast corridors of the temple.

where the ceiling has been raised to accomidate its size.  Within the
statue's hands are a massive broadsword made of a crimson metal and a
shield make of humanoid skulls.  Hanging from the eastern and western
walls are tattered tapestries which have been destroyed by time, making
identification of their original pictures impossible.  To the south the

composed of humanoid skulls which have been coated with a thin,
translucent green slime.  Etched into the eastern wall are at least half
a dozen small carvings, each portraying a different type of demon. 
Beneath the carvings in the wall to the east are several rows of ancient
writing, faded and barely readable from ages of erosion.  To the south
the wall is completely bare save for a triangle-shaped depression.

adamantite door, large enough to allow a storm giant to pass through
without ducking.  To the south the passage continues through a veil of

four-polled bed of fine shuvana wood, draped in a black veil, has been
set against the western wall.  A dark maple wardrobe, its doors open and
interior empty, stands on the northern side of the room.  Set into the

Black Temple - Abandoned Clergy's Quarters~
This small room is filled with broken tables, wardrobes, chairs and
bookcases.  Black silk tapestries hang from the southern wall, shredded
beyond recognition and covered in dried blood.  The remains of stone
statues stand in each of the corners of the room; reduced to nothing more
than a mere pile of crumbled stone.  Set into a niche in the western wall
is a small shrine adorned with human skulls topped with black tallow
candles.  Lying sprawled out in the center of the room are the remains of
two humans; one covered in red and white plate armor and the other in a
mere set of black robes.  To the north a dented steel door leads out of
the room and back into the corridor.

Black Temple - Cobweb-Filled Corridor~
Battered pieces of rusty plate armor lie scattered about the floor of the
corridor; thick strands of ivory-white web wrapped tightly around them. 
Etched into the northern wall are several odd-looking symbols, each
outlined by a series of sparkling blood-red gems.  Examining the webs
that span across the hallway and almost completely block off the southern
passage you notice they are extremely thicker than what a common spider
could weave even over several years.  The corridor continues to the west
into a veil of darkness while to the south the passage becomes slightly
illuminated by a soft green glow.

Black Temple - Cobweb-Filled Corridor~
An extremely large and thick cobweb crosses over this section of the
corridor here and entangled within it are the skeletal remains of several
humanoids.  Two torches hang from the eastern and western walls of the
passage, each of them flickering with a dull orange flame which barely
illuminates the passage and do no harm to the strands of web which
delicately hang inches above their flames.  Further to the south along
the corridor the soft green glow which illuminates the hallway becomes
brighter.  The corridor continues to stretch to the north and south from
here, through the mass of tangled cobwebs.

Black Temple - Cobweb-Filled Corridor~
The cobwebs in the corridor here are extremely thick and you constantly
have to wipe them away and untangle yourself from them.  The corpses of
several armored humanoids have been entombed in a cacoon of cobwebs and
propped up against the southern wall.  Rusty swords, shields and battle
maces can be clearly seen lying behind a thick sheet of webbing in a
niche carved into the eastern wall.  A soft green glow illuminates the
corridor, causing the cobwebs to take on a shiny forest-green color.  To
the north and west the corridor continues, constantly kept illuminated by
the glow.

Black Temple - Cobweb-Filled Corridor~
Portions of the walls in this section of the corridor have crumbled,
leaving large gaping holes from within which you can hear the faint sound
of dripping water.  The floor and ceiling have had murals of shadowy
figures lurking in a heavily forested area stalking a group of centaurs
painted across their surface.  Lying partially buried beneath a mound of
stone debris along the northern wall are several sapphire-encrusted
golden braziers which have been molded in the shape of an open dragon's
claw.  The bright green glow which illuminates the corridor here
intensifies to the south while it diminishes to the east the corridor
moves further away from it.

Black Temple - Glowing Chamber~
The walls of this large circular chamber are covered in a thick blanket
of green fungi which sheds an almost blinding green glow about the room
and down the corridors.  Beneath the layers of fungus you can
occasionally catch a glimpse of something metallic shining beneath it. 
The floor of the chamber is scarred by many deep scratches made by an
extremely sharp object as the cuts drive four inches into the hard
obsidian.  A few cobwebs hang from the corners of the chamber and within
a few of them you can see several small bugs entangled in the fine
strands of silken thread.  A hallway makes its way out of the chamber to
the north, illuminated brightly by the green glow while to the east the
area remains pitch black.

Black Temple - Bone-Strewn Chamber~
This large stone chamber has been crudely chisled out from the black
obsidian stone, leaving bits of jagged rocks exposed.  Filling the
chamber are several hundred bones which lie in heaps, some reaching three
feet high.  Among the many bones you notice that most of them resemble
humanoid skulls and leg bones while others have been snapped and gnawed
away at, making identification of what creature they came from impossible. 
Lying along the northeast wall of the chamber are several large oval
balls of web, resembling a cacoon a spider would leave after it had
killed its prey.  A large, gaping hole can be clearly seen in the eastern
wall and although it is completely dark you can hear a faint crunching
sound emanating within it.  To the west a smooth, stone hallway begins to
make its way through the temple, illuminated by a nearly blinding bright
green glow.
