Crown Of The World~
This is the single highest tree in all of the Great Vaasa, and from it
you can see much of the sea of green.  Spread out before you is the
beautiful canopy of the mighty forest with the rare spire lancing out of
it, toward the sun.  Mounted nearby on a large branch is the Horn of
Ral'airdn.  A blow from this @bhorn@n can be heard for miles through the
forest.  Below you the branches form a natural ladder leading down to the
altar of Tarafas.

horn~
Hanging from a branch by leather straps, the horn is a beautiful tool. 
The ends are bound in silver and engraved along it's length are elven and
forest scenes.  The horn is said to come from the Ral'airdn.  A rare and
dangerous beast that roams only the deepest parts of the great forest.  
~
E
5 spires stone~
The spires of stone are the only things that interupt the sea of green,
besides perhaps the enclosing mountains to the west and south.  The
spires are sharp points of rock, thousands of feet tall, conical
formations pointing toward the heavens.

$n steps over to the the horn and blows a loud long note through it.  The
sound is strange, and it echos away through the wood.  Afterwhich a hush

Taking a huge breath ....  you blow the horn!  The sound of it echos
around you and then off through the forest.  After the last echos fade,
the forest seems hushed, as if a collective breath is held.

Weapon Smithy~
You stand in a large hut with walls of leather, covered in some substance
that must protect it from the stray spark.  The floor is a huge flat slab
of stone, and standing in the middle is a great open hearth.  It is quite
hot in here, and lit by the hearth in shifting yellows and reds.  The
trunk of the tree composes the north east wall, and hanging from it and
from many branches that crisscross the room, are items of war.

Armor Shoppe~
You have entered a well-lit elven shop.  Two walls are near-flat trunks,
while the other two are tightly woven branches and living wood and look
woven well enough to keep the warmth in and the cold winds out.  Covering
the walls are articles of armor, suits of leather, cloaks for protection
and warmth.  Cases with delicate crystal panes hold suits of metal, some
bronze, some chain.  Others hold glinting helms and shiny plates.

Base Of Branch~
You come to the base of a large branch that grows from the trunk, and
runs away to the south.  Above you, secured on three huge branches, is a
stone floored building, built against the side of the trunk.  How they
got that huge slab of stone up here is beyond you.  There is a flap
covering an opening, which you could go up and use to enter.

Tree Top, Above Weapon Smithy~
You are standing on a good sized branch far above the forest floor, with
the sound of banging metal drifting up from just below you.  Above you
the massive trunk of this enormous tree reaches toward the sky, though
the size and frequency of the limbs do not allow you to ascend any
further.  From this vantage point you can look out over much of the vast
forest, and it is truly breathtaking.  Far off in the distance to the
east, you can see one of the great rock spires vaulting from the sea of
green and spearing towards the sky.

rock spire~
The top of the forest is a sea of green, as far as the eye can see,
undulating only a little.  But here and there, grey spires of stone, like
spears, jab upward out of the sea, reaching toward the sky.  Their slopes
are too steep for much foliage, but there is some.

trunks and putting the gnarled limbs to good use.

Huge Branch~
You stand on a huge branch that extends from the main trunk to the east
and runs away through the foliage to the west.  There is another branch
nearby that you could use to get to a pair of trees to the north, from
where come sounds of clinking metal.  Looking over the side, you catch a
rare glimpse of the ground far below and guess you are at least 250 ft
up.

Main Level - Below Magic Shop~
You are standing below a shop on a large platform.  The platform is made
of living wood woven into a dense mat.  About you the branches form a
sort of wall allowing passage only to the east where a walkway runs.  The
branches above you form a ladder that leads up to the shop.  Sounds of
chanting incantations drift down from above.

You stand upon a walkway that leads toward a huge tree to the north and
west where it intersects another walkway.  Living branches are molded and
and prodded to grow the right directions, then woven together to make
these walkways.  The foliage about you is very dense, however you are
able to get glances of the nearby areas.

In the daytime the light trickles down and shines on this spot, and in
the evening there is dusky shade.  It seems to be some sort of short

trunk of the tree that leads below to the main level of town.  Above you
the branches form a ladder that leads above the shop.  Herbs are hung to

core tree spring~
Upon closer examination you can tell that the spring is the life force of
this ancient tree, without it, it would be dead and so would a part of
the core of the elven spirit.  The core of the tree is still alive and is
keeping the whole tree alive and well, and will continue doing so for
many centuries if undisturbed.

On the Entry Platform~
This is the main entry to the largest village of the Llewyrr in the Great
Vaasa.  Not many guards are needed here, as trespassers are usually dealt
with long before getting this close.  A rope-ladder dangles over the edge
here, disappearing in the many levels of leaves and canopy foliage, and a
walkway leads away east, its planks seeming to have been shaped from the
large branch that supports it.

The deer trail winds its way around some very large shuvanas here.  Some

arching out over the trail.  Part of the trail even begins to feel like

you could climb the walls, the top is sealed off with a wooden hatch.

There is a note scrawled in blood on the wall.

frequently the elves forget they have dumped prisoners in this pit.

The Observatory Platform~
This large platform seems to be built from sturdy logs.  The only
structure of it's kind in the whole city.  This also appears to be one of
the few areas with a completely unobstructed view of the heavens.  All
about the perimeter of this platform sticks, are mounted, pointing to
locations where various constellations are spotted at certain times of
the year.  In the center of the platform a large hollow log is mounted,
on some kind of stand.

covered by heavy fern and other plants.  Pushing some of them aside, you

Tight Burrow Tunnel~
You are hunched down in a narrow tunnel dug through dirt and even
suprisingly, rock, by some animal.  The short tunnel bends quckly here
and heads east toward the center of the mound, and south, where you see
light from the small entrance.

This is the burrow dug by a rare and dangerous animal known as the
Aurumvorax.  The walls are rich dark dirt and stone, held together by
pale roots, some of which which hang down and brush your skin as you
move.  Bones litter much of the room at the base of the walls, leaving
the center of the room open, where a bed of plants have been made.

Forested River Bank~
The undergrowth opens up here as it comes to the edge of a slow moving
river.  The river flows north and seems to originate from the mountains
to the southwest and west.  The trail follows the bank north and south,
but you also spot a deer-trail heading east, back into the depths of the
Vaasa.

The trail following the quietly burbling river slowly fades away to
nothing, as just to the north, the forest's undergrowth reaches all the
way to the water's edge.  As you are just turning away, you note that
some of the reflected rays of light along the verdant bank seem strange. 
A trail leads north and south from here.

Forest Trail~
The rich colors of the forest enclose you in a heavy embrace here. 
Strange formations covered in wisteria and fern rise from the
undergrowth, radiating a feeling of foreboding and ancient age.  The
trail winds its way north and south, the latter being where you spy even
more of the formations.

Forest Ruins~
The green covered formations, or perhaps structures, surround you.  They
rise out of the depths of the forest, tower over you, and run all the way
down to the river's edge which is just to the west.  The vegetation thins
between them, growing up between dark blocks of stone, with the trail
bending through them, heading north and east.

Strange Ruins~
You seem to be standing before a gateway or entrance to ancient ruins. 
Though there is no gate, there are two guardian statues which appear to
have been used to impress new travelers or scare away enemies.  There is
also a crumbling wall whose rubble is overgrown with moss.  A trail
wanders away into the forest south.

Faint Trail~
Huge acorns lay scattered about the ground, many broken as if by smashing
against a stone.  From far above you hear the annoyed chatter of the
chipmunks.  The faint trail leads tightly between two massive shuvana
trunks as it continues to the east and south.

The trail runs into a small ravine which is heading south and north from

from travelling that direction.  The bottom of the ravine is filled with
leaves and small plants, and it appears water has not been here for many
moons.

Old Trail~
This appears to be the end of the forest trail.  The soft dirt of the
forest trail has turned into hard rocks of the mountain.  Looking up, a
fear seems to radiate from the mountain depths.  Looking into the
forest however, you feel great age, strength, and long harmony.

You are at the base of a rugged trail that leads up and into the massive

from here.  Large stormy clouds lay over the mountains looking very
foreboding, while the sea of green to your east looks exotic and
inviting.

stone monument granite~
The massive stone monument is bigger than any boulder you have ever seen,
and someone has managed to place it right out in the open, off to the
side of trail.  The stone has been cut from solid granite.  It is shaped
in a perfect square, without a single crack, rough edge, or blemish of
any kind.  The only thing to break up the perfect face of the stone box
is a small inscription.
~
E
inscription~
Carved in perfect letters you read:

        @bTruths of the Highlands

                @bIf the highlands fall, the realm falls.
                What is good for the highlands, is good for the realm.
                What makes the highlands and the Highland folks
                strong shall be the greatest good, and shall be done.

        Laws of the Highlands

                All manner of creature may enjoy the beauty and adventure
                that await them in the highlands, however, no one but
                respectable highland folks shall attempt to make a home or
                practice their trade in the mountainous regions.
                Highlanders will always strike back when one of their own
                is wounded.
                Let the fine highland folks know the laws, and the Heroes
                of the Highlands enforce them.@n

Below the inscription you can see a smaller quote etched into the rock,
which reads '@bBring not the blood of your wars to mountainous soil, lest
the Heroes bring the weight of the mountain down on top of you.@n'

--Alec 4th Thane of the Heroes--

Looking up through the trees to the northeast you see the tip of a large
rock spire pierces the canopy of the forest.  It's hard to tell, but
there appears to be something moving up among the rocks.  The trail

root small gnaw marks are visible.  The dirt tunnel leads back to the

This small storage chamber is filled with strange golden globules.  From

golden globuals~
These small golden globuals are the excretion of a race of insect like
creatures that live in the Vaasa.  The queen of the woodworms eats these
and then excretes a gene laced liquid on the new buds of the Shuvana
trees, these buds are eaten by the insects and then the genes are carried
to other woodworms queens.  Thus freshening the gene pool.

You stand in a narrow, leaf-filled ravine.  Moisture has collected into
drops of dew that seem to cover everything here.  A tangle of spiny vines
impedes all travel further up the ravine.  To the south the faint trail
leads down the dry ravine and to the west it leads up and out of the

The burbling waters of the Windlass continue winding their way along its
time-set path.  Ancient rocks cut wide swaths in the waterflow as it is
forced to rush around the implacable objects.  For the rocks to have
lasted so long, they must have once been huge.  In a few more centuries
they will be little more than so many pebbles lining the Windlass's bed.

Beside a Small River~
The small river winds around you to the north and east as it avoids the
massive roots of the shuvana you stand before.  Upon the thick bark of
the shuvana, to the south, a set of odd @Rcarvings@n appear.  To the east a
small natural dam has been created by the forces of nature consisting of
boulders and branches.

The carvings appear to have been made by a claw or some dull blade and
are highlighted by a dark red-black stain.  They do not appear to be in
any language that you know, in fact some appear to be more like crude
pictures than words or letters.  Unsettlingly, one appears to be a
gruesome, almost demonic, face.

A Small Dam of Boulders~
Large lichen and moss-covered boulders block the streams progress,
creating a natural dam and pooling water from the north.  You see several
orangish fish swimming about in this pool.  Between the large boulders,
branches have piled up over the years clogging the flow of water even
more and contributing to the rushing noise.

Large boulders, mostly covered in dense vines and shrubery are strewn
about in between the large shuvanas that grow here.  Many of these
boulders, left by the glaciers that formed this valley long before the
existence of any sort of creatures, have been completely overtaken by the
wild forest and only large mounds attest for their presence.

providing food for the critters of the forest.

Faint Path Beside a Small River~
Several small rivlets of water runs across the already muddy animal path
from a spring to your east into the small river to the south east. 
Imprinted in the cool mud are the tracks of a multitude of animals, small
and large.  The small animal path turns to the south and west as it
follows the bank of the river.

A Small Pool on a Small River~
A dam of boulders and large branches, washed down by heavy rains, has
built up over time to the south, creating this small pool of slow moving
water.  The current of the river is barely noticable as it lightly pulls
twigs and leaves, fallen from trees, down the river.  To the north and
east you see, past the bank of the river, what looks like a small animal
path.

Collapsed Chamber~
It appears the builders of the ruins above also created a series of
underground passages.  What was once a T-section is now hopelessly blocked
to the south by fallen stone which created the hole above, while to the
north the tunnel continues on.  A strange peaked archway of stone rests in
the eastern stone wall.

The Vaasa~
The vegetation encompasses you completely.  There is no sight of a break
in the greenery save for the huge shuvana root that lays across the trail
to the west.  You can either try and go up over the root, or head back
east into the dense vegetations.

The Vaasa~
At the foot of one tree, a small spring bubbles forth.  The spring
forms a small pool, then trickles forth a short ways before disappearing
back underground.  Large green ferns and mosses grow around the secluded
spring, fed well by the deep waters brought forth.

spring water~
You examine the spring and find its source located behind the fronds of a
fern overlooking its rim.  The natural waters trickle down over hard
rock, leaving a sparkling trail with flecks of silvery-blue light in it. 
The basin the waters empty into is a few feet wide and remains shallow.

flecks 6 silvery-blue blue light~
The flecks appear to be some sort of material brought up from deep within

The Vaasa~
The trees begin to thicken, their great trunks forming a living artwork
of shapes and shadows, painted in part by shifting rays of light. 
Thousands of little shafts of sunlight manage to pierce the shifting
canopy above like little spears causing little dust motes to sparkle and
glow.

E
blade grass ground~
You can see nothing out of the ordinary about it, it is just simple green
grass growing within the clearing.
~
E
moss~
A spongy little greenish yellow moss that seems to like its rocky home. 
It feels somewhat soft to the touch.
~
E
5 stones 6 markers~
The stone markers each jut out of the ground with roughly two to three
feet exposed above the ground and an indeterminite amount beneath the
ground.  They are covered sparsely by a rough moss that grows in the
cracks of the weatherworn surface.
~
E
trees~
The trees, ancient beyond reckoning, appear to mirror the clearing
perfectly.  Although they line the rim with uncanny accurateness, you can
see no sign that blade or hand has ever turned their growth.  They appear
to have grown this way naturally, somehow defying the general chaotic
growth of the wilds.
~
E
altar~
The altar is formed from a slab of granite resting across two more blocks
of granite.  The crosspiece on top is smooth and timeworn from ages of
use.  The two granite blocks holding it up still retain some of the
rougher details from their initial quarrying.

You have managed to get completely lost in the great Vaasan Forest, and

surrounded by an arc of giant stone monoliths engraved with a single,
identical icon on each.  The only way out appears to be an opening to the

Path Through the Heather - Before a Mighty Shuvana~
The sunlight ripples off the ocean of heather here, as it waves gently in
the breeze.  The small leaves quiver as small animals and birds disturb
their dreamy sway.  Little insects chirrup, basking on the leaves.  The
scent of flowers blows across the sea of heather.  The trees here are
slightly smaller than the huge shuvanas in the deeper forest, however one
of the massive trees grows here.  It looks old enough to be from a time
when this was still part of the all encompassing forest, and the pool was
only a puddle.  It towers over the surrounding trees, standing tall and
proud, the remnant of a long forgotten past.  The bark is rough and very
hard, but there looks to be small cuts up the side closest to the forest. 
From the west you can just hear the sounds of a river washing through the
trees.

A Home High Within a Shuvana~
A large, open-plan house has been cut into the trunk of the Shuvana at
the widest point.  The tree is still alive around it, embracing the home
its its mighty branches.  The room seems to have been built long ago, in
a time forgotten to generations past.  The furnishings, however, seem new
and well maintained.  The decorations are cleverly made in sylvan colours
and blend in well.  A balcony is built out on a limb to the east, while
to the west stands a door.  Handholds carved into the tree's mighty trunk
can be climbed to the field of heather below.
~
If this is an elven home, you might want to change it a bit.  Check out
the elven city, they don't cut the wood generally, particularly not
living wood.  Its all carefully shaped/grown over many years.  - Talis.

On the Windlass~
Over the centuries the Windlass seems to have eroded the fertile ground
of the Vaasa.  The walls of the riverbed stretch above your head by
several feet.  Underfoot you can feel countless smooth pebbles, worn away
by the constant flow of water.

The flow of the Windlass pick up rapidly, accompanied by a loud roaring
sound.  It is not until you catch yourself of a large dam of logs,
trapped by boulders, that you realize your narrowly avoided fate.  To the
south the sheer walls of the riverbed stop abuptly as the Windlass comes
to an abrupt, and dazzling, end and flows over the edge of a cliff to
form a spectacular waterfall.

The abundant greenery of the forest floor is broken where a

density of the undergrowth crossing the path impedes progress, however
the trail could be followed east or south with a little effort.  To the

At the Base of an Oak Tree~
You stand in a small hollow in the woods, at the center of which stand a
large oak tree.  The ground about the base is littered in acorn
fragments, chewed through by foraging animals long ago.  Gnarled oak
roots occassionaly break the uniform surface of the ground.  Dense
vegetation surrounds the hollow on all sides except the east.  In that
direction the vegetation is thin enough to push through and reach what
seems to be a trail.

Small Clearing by a Fallen Oak~
The remains of a fallen oak rests on the ground offering a relatively
comfortable place for bipeds to sit a while and admire the view.  The
fall of the oak managed to crush several of the bushes and small trees in
its path providing a small clearing of sorts.  Where a few crushed bushes
still manage to grow the branches of new growth and of old growth, still
struggling to recover from the devastating blow, hang over the fallen
bole.

The leaves are longer than they are wide, and rounded at both ends giving

The dark soil lays in a long swath along the ground and seems to be the

Broad leaves with little spikes around their fringe lay close to the

Under a Great Root~
Animal tracks in the fertile soil show that the trail passes under the
great root.  The root rises from the base of a shuvana tree south of
here, arching overhead only to dip deep down into the ground again just
north of here.  Proliferant vegetation grows right up to the edge of the
openings to the east and west beyond which lies the rest of the forest.

Faint Trail~
The animal trail twists and turns here, avoiding branches and roots often. 
For the most part it seems to run predominantly west and south of here. 
Particularly large ferns dapple the ground in shadow and light, their
large fronds arcing overhead.  A break in the dense foliage to the south
shows a large clearing in that direction.

An ocean of heather ripples around you as you stand here in a large field. 
Standing in the northwest corner, the shuvana trees to the east and south
appear almost normal in size at this distance.  The great trees to the
north and west, however, are much closer and quickly remove any illusion
that you are in a lesser forest.  A break in the greenery to the north
shows a spot where animals enter and leave the forest here.

A good number of obvious animal tracks lead in from the west only to
rapidly disapear as the ground becomes less yielding to the east.  The
low bushes begin to gain size and mass toward the east as well, their
root systems leechng more of the moisture from the ground to dry it.  As
the vegetation grows thicker, the way becomes harder forcing you to
frequently move branches that obstruct your path.

thick branches that yield only with hard work on your part.  Countless
leaves on the branches tend to obscure your sight beyond a few feet in
any direction.  No matter how many of the branches you break back or move
aside, there always seems to be two more ready to spring into the space
created.

As you wend your way through the trailless woodland you are forced to
contend with unyielding branches, troublesome roots and tricky footing
over rock and leaf-filled depressions.  Though difficult and at times
even treacherous to get here, the woods yield as many rewards as it does
dangers.  The crystal drops of clear dew hanging from tilted leaves yield
up such treasures as small rainbows in the air.  The gentle breeze
carries with it the aromatic boquet of nearby flowers and the sound of a
nearby brook burbles along with it.

the gap, forming a tenuous connection with the other side.  A game trail
leads west, deeper into the lush foliage.

ravine down~
Looking down over the edge of the ravine, you see that it is not that far
to the bottom.  Certainly a fall from the height would be harmfull,
perhaps even lethal, but the abundance of roots protruding from the steep
side might make the climb down possible.
~
E
shuvana roots bridge 1 east~
Water from somewhere high overhead slowly drips down onto the large roots
that stretch over the ravine.  Slick mosses have found purchase on the
roots, living off the sunlight and ample water.  Unfortunately, you find
that the end result has produced a natural bridge that is slippery and
dangerous almost to the point of impossibility.

The greenery is a complex tangle of countless plants in all their

Two distinct layers can be seen from the forest floor.  The closest is
sparse and formed by the smaller trees; oaks, maples, birch and the like. 
Higher above that canopy exists the lush, verdant canopy formed by the
shuvana trees as their lower branches arc outwards and mingle with each
other.

While shuvanas form the majority of the trees in the woods, others

The treeline stops abruptly in a nearly perfect arc from south to west

break in the trees west of here shows a spot where animals sometimes
enter or leave the forest.

This is as high as the thinning branches will allow you to safely climb. 
Any higher and they would probably snap, and falling from this height
would most assuredly be fatal.  You are close enough to the top that you

Slippery Shuvana Roots Crossing a Ravine~
From the dizzying height above the ravine, the normally large shuvana
roots seem much smaller and frailer at this moment.  The slick moss
shifts with a loose easiness under your feet as it releases its tenuous
grip.  A consistent drizzle rains down steadily from somewhere high in
the canopy feeding the moss and roots.  It would be an easy, and avisable
thing, to make your way east or west off either side of the root as
speedily as safely possible.

first, you might fall to your death.

In the Lower Branches of an Elm~
About halfway up the side of the elm you find that the branches around
you are wide and strong.  The branches stem out in all directions from
the main trunk forming a fairly good laticework on which you can climb
outward or upward.  The constant rustling of the leaves amidst the outer
branches alerts you to the possibilities that their may be an abudant
colony of birds nearby.

In the Upper Branches of an Elm~
The ragged bark of the elm you are ensconced becomes smoother as it
reaches upwards where the new growth is.  What was once could have been
the main bole of the tree looks like no more than the other branches
around it, typical to the shape of all elms.  While it looks to be an
easy climb downward, where thicker branches easily support your weight
and lend footholds, it is appearant you would be unable to climb any
higher.

The Lower Branches of an Elm - Northern Side~
Lush, green leaves obscure a great deal of sight in most directions,
though the thick branches that sprout the leaves are seen clearly enough
from this close.  Though the branches are thick enough to support you
safely here, they rapidly diminish in size as you head northward away
from the elm's large bole.  A few broken branches a little further out
seem to show evidence that someone else attempted to head that way, and
obviously failed.

Amidst branches thick enough to support you smaller branches weave in and

Darker clusters hidden in the greenery seem to be the nests of birds or

extent of your grasp.  Westward you see the thick bole of the elm that

@ROUCH!@n That really hurt!  You must have shifted off of the branche you

Maybe next time you should look for someplace a little wider and perhaps
a bit lcoser to the ground to sleep on.

$n gives a little sniff, shifts in $s sleep, and suddenly disapears over

A dark shape plummets to the ground from the branches above.  After a

cant_see~
You don't see the hive right now, but it must be close for you to hear
such a profusion of buzzing.  A careful observation of your surroundsings
show that a great many of the little bees bumbling about seem to be
headed behind a few specific branches.

do_see~
A typical honeycomb formed of small octagonal chamber filled with either
the larvae of bees or dripping with honey.  If there's enough honey left,
and the bees don't object too much, perhaps you could get enough honey to
fill a cup or maybe even a whole jar!

A few nearby branches slip their hold and slap back against the beehive

The Lower Branches of an Elm - Western Side~
Branches as thick around as a strong ogre mingle with lesser branches
that would snap under any significant weight.  If you were to progress
any further westward you would surely fall a few score of feet to the
hard-packed earth far below.  Through the clusters of leaves to the east
you can see the main trunk of the elm within which you are suspended.
