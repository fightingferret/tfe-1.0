Large Cave Entrance~
Before you, a very large opening in the hillside seems to split the hill
in half.  The yawning mouth of the cave is enormous, and seems to engulf
the surrounding terrain.  The hard-packed, dirt path slopes downward
oward it, leading into darkness.  Two large boulders on either side of
the cave entrance keep loose stones and dirt from spilling into the
massive cavern.  A small path leads up to a ledge above the mouth of the
cave.

Inside The Cavern~
This large, dim room gives shelter to the rock formations all around
you.  Stalagtites hang from the top, most of them broken off.  They drip
water onto you and the stone floor, making everything musty and damp. 
Two equally large tunnels branch off from here going into the darkness
north and west.

Top Of A Small Hill~
You are at the top of a small hill.  A large cave entrance at the bottom
of the hill to the north draws your attention.  The small foothills
surrounding this place make it seem like a valley.  The smaller hills are
dwarfed by a large mound to the north.  The huge, snow-capped spires of
the Cairn mountains in the distance loom over the hillside.

Before A Small Hill~
This muddy path has taken you to the base of a small hill.  Just beyond
it, the top of a more rough looking hill can be seen.  The path up the
hill seems more stable, with a few pebbles packed into its hard dirt. The
few wild bushes around you have been trampled down, and what little wild
grass there is seems to be dying, its color a faint brown.

Bend In The Muddy Path~
The path bends around the beginning of a small hill and continues to the
north.  Your feet sink into the dark mud, making it an effort to walk at
normal pace.  You can see more small, grey hills to the east, and a
larger one to the north.  There are a few wild flowers trampled by the
side of the path, and a dying sapling grows just to the south, many of
its branches are broken and limp.

Muddy Path~
Entering the foothills of the Cairn Mountains, the snow-capped peaks loom
above you in the distance to the north.  The foothills themselves are
a rocky, barren area covered with little more than mud and stones.  The
occassional gnarled pine struggles to stand against the ever present
mountain wind.  A rather vague path winds its way westward, covered in
soupy, black mud.

to the cave entrance.

the wild grass growing in the foothills down below.  They look like giant
footprints, leading to this particular cavern.  Looking down, you can see
the small dirt path and the small hill far below.  The wind here blows
dirt and small rocks from the wall behind you, pelting you with tiny
stings.  There is a small beehive on a large rock above you.

You are in a large tunnel that travels north and south.  The dirt path is
packed down hard, and you can make out giant footprints heading north.

Western Tunnel~
This dirt path has fallen into disuse.  Dusty and littered with small

entrance to the cave.  The rough, stone walls are covered with jagged
rocks and clusters of clear quartz.  The main tunnel curves to the north,
with a smaller tunnel continuing west.

Tunnel~

these walls and rocks.  Several scars show where larger crystals have
been ripped from the walls.

At The Underground Lake~
This wide cavern houses a shallow, underground lake.  The water is
crystal clear; bottom of the pool is quite evident.  To the west, a small
waterfall flows into the lake from a high ledge, the roar of the falling
water echoing through the cavern.  Huge, jagged rocks prevent any
westward movement, blocking off access to the waterfall.  The dirt path
turns into packed clay that leads east into another giant opening in the
rock.

This low tunnel almost forces you to duck to avoid the small rocks that

sorts.  A large calcium deposit shaped like a column extends down to the
ground, the dim light making it glow like a lantern.  There is a small

The smell of decay is even worse in here.  The sounds of water echo off
the large walls throughout this cavernous tunnel.  A ledge high on the
north wall disappears into the eastern rock face right above the tunnel. 
Large, flat rocks jut out of the north wall, forming a crude, yet
climbable, staircase to the ledge.  The path continues to the east and

A Giant Room~
This huge room has been roughly carved out of the rock.  The floor and
walls are uneven and cracked.  A small lantern sits on a grand oak table
in the middle of the room.  There are fairly new-looking doors to the
west and north, and an old, rotted door to the south.
~
[Merior] extras would be nice here

Extravagantly carved and lovingly polished, this oak table seems out of

A Private Room~
This room is larger than any you have encountered in the tunnels and
decorated with various animal skins.  A poorly cured grizzly rug covers a
giant stone slab, and a dragonskin hangs above it on the wall.  Lanterns
hang on the walls, providing enough light to see the ceiling, which is
cracked, water dripping onto the floor.  A rotted wooden lever sticks out
of a crack in the wall.

A Prison~
In this room, there is a small cage to the west, not occupied at the
moment.  Another large table sits to the north, and a huge, dirty leather
vest is hung over a nearby chair.

Treasure Room~
Adjoined to the chieftan's room, the hill giants treasure vault is easily
guarded by Gharl.  Though it is merely a tiny alcove roughly chiseled out
of the rock, it contains many treasures, most broken and worthless.  Here
is where all the gold and gems are stored after digging them out of rocks
or, more often, stealing them from helpless victims.
