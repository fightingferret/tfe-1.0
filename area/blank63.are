Deep Forest, Large Hole~
The trees of the forest thin out here.  You notice a rather large, gaping
hole in the ground, partially covered by a fallen tree.  Oddly, the soil
around the hole looks fresh.  Around the periphery of the hole, tufts of
bright green grass are growing.
~

[Merior] the hole is just TOO obvious..  make them work a little bit to

Moist Tunnel~
The exit above provides a slight breeze of fresh air in this cramped
tunnel.  The earth is a ruddy brown color, and moist to the touch.  The
breeze causes dirt from above to cascade down the tunnel walls, like
miniature avalanches.

Moist Tunnel~
This tunnel is about five feet in diameter.  Thin filamentous roots hang
from the ceiling of the eastern tunnel, partially obstructing the view to
the east.  The air is humid, yet cool, and smells slightly sweet.  The
tunnel appears to widen gradually as it continues eastward.

This chamber is surprisingly free from all debris.  In fact, even the
hard-packed ground is dust-free.  A ruddy brown waxy substance coats the
tunnel entrance, and slowy tapers into nothing as it advances into the

ground, forming a small muddy pool along the southern wall.
