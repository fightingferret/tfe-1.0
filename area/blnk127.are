Before The Encompassing Darkness~
You stand near the edge of a jagged cliff, not quite close enough to see
over the edge.  Floating off to the north, just above eye level, is a
roiling cloud of shadows and darkness.  Pungent odors seemingly brought
forth from the ominous cloud assault your senses.  The smells of death
and decay mingled with the acrid scent of sulfur burn your nose.  The
darkness brought on by the massive cloud deepens as it radiates out from
the edge of the cliff to the north.  A deep crevice can be seen within
the southern wall of the cliff, heading into darkness.

massive cloud~
A deep blackness, that appears to be slowly building as it edges closer
and closer to you, hovers just above eye level to the north.  While hard
to truly focus on this cloud, as all natural light that manages to pass
through it is scattered and distorted, the cloud appears to be more than
just amassed common vapors.

E
cliff edge~
Just a short distance to the north is the edge of the cliff upon which
you stand.  While hard to gather any details, it is obvious that to get a
closer look at the roiling cloud you will have to venture much closer to

Entering The Darkness -- Jagged Cliff~
Standing on the edge of the jagged cliff, you are now able to look out
over the dismal swamp.  No living creatures can be seen from this height,
though a few errant ripples can be viewed in the murky water.  The few
trees that remain standing appear as if they are mere skeletons of their
former selves.  An occasional, faint crackling sound can be heard,
reminiscent of a distant fire being squelched.

A deep grey landscape looms below you, only the occasional ripple allows
you to distinguish that the ground is in fact covered by water.
~
E
trees~
The trees of this swamp have not fared well over the years; all of them
now appear to be dead.  Those that are standing speak of the strength the
tree must have posessed in past years, as even in death they have not
succumbed to the elements and fallen.
~
E
jagged cliff~
Looking carefully at and over the jagged cliff, it appears to be quite
easily climbable.  Convenient hand and footholds seem to be placed at
heights just right for an average human male.  The jagged protrusions of
the rough granite have been noticeably smoothed away near each of the
handholds.
~
E
dismal swamp~
A feeling of dread begins to creep over you as you stare out over the
dismal swamp that looms before you.  Combinations of the roiling cloud,

Below The Jagged Cliff~
A jagged cliff soars high overhead off towards the east as it curves
around in a northerly direction.  The soft, mushy ground beneath the
depths of stagnant water seems to be wrought with remnants of vines and
tree roots.  Undoubtably the swamp used to be a much healthier ecosystem,
though now it appears to be virtually dead of natural life.  The shallow
waters stretch to the base of a granite cliff to the east, while to the
northwest the shadows deepen over the heart of the swamp.

Along the Granite Cliff~
The cliff walls sweep around you from the east and continue around you to
the northwest.  You are in a small, protected cubby formed by the curving
of a granite cliff, offering you some protection from the wind.  The
depth of the water seems to dramatically change from just a few inches up
close to the cliff to a few feet as you head away from the cliff to the
northeast.  You can see a faint yellowish stain on the face of the cliff
at a height just above the level of the water.

The granite cliff is grey in color and shows obvious signs of harsh

~
E
yellowish stain~
A sickly yellowish stain mars the surface of the cliff.  Judging by the
acrid vapors and the occasional bubble welling up from the dark depths of
the water, the stain could very well be a residue of sulfur left on the
rocks.

Along the Granite Cliff~
A towering granite cliff dominates your view to the west, and can be seen
curving around you a short distance to the south.  The granite here
appears to be well worn by the water and is generally smooth, though odd
pockmarks mar its surface in a few places.  Small boulders litter the
area, apparently pieces of the cliff that have sheared off over the past. 
The deepening of the water, from the cliff face eastward seems to halt at
a tangle of vines that bars your passage.

A Crumbling Granite Cliff~
Large chunks of the granite cliff litter the area.  The granite boulders
enclose a pool of dark water that seems to be cut off from the rest of
the swamp.  The great cliff soars high overhead to the west; to the north
it wraps around, blocking all movement in that direction.  As if thrown
about by an enraged giant, large tree trunks lie amongst the tangle of
vines to the east.  Your only available path lies to the south, making
your way along the granite cliffs and from there back into the heart of
the swamp.

Tireth's Swamp~
To the southwest, granite cliffs dominate the landscape at this distance,
even as the base of the cliffs is lost under the horizon of the stagnant
water.  Tangled vines poke out ranomly from beneath the depths, further
hindering attempts to traverse the swamp.  The roiling cloud which hangs
above you appears to be pulsing in a horrid mimicry of a heartbeat. 
Further amplifying the effect is a dull rhythmic thumping that seems to
resonate from the north.  The granite cliffs angle away from you towards
the south, the path to them blocked by thistle and vines.

Tangled vines and thistle halt any advancement towards the east and the
cliffs that lie beyond.  Granite cliffs, seemingly the only refuge from
the gusty wind, stand silently in shadows far off to the west.  The
shattered remnants of a once mighty tree lie half-buried in the muck of
the stagnant water.  It looks like the swamp opens up a bit to the north
once you can get past the mire of vines to the northwest.  The towering

Tireth's Swamp~
The water ripples out in circular patterns as a droplet of condensation
falls silently from the skeletal remains of a once grand tree.  A slight
curvature of the trunk and the bare twisted limbs give the impression
that the tree was writhing in agony as the leaves of its last bloom fell. 
Standing as if a ghastly sentinel in the midst of the open swamp, it acts
as a landmark for the local area.  The only direction that seems
impassable is towards the west where a great tangle of vines and toppled
tree trunks lie.

Tireth's Swamp~
The ground beneath your feet is little more than thin mud.  Walking is
near impossible as each step you take creates a suction against which you
are forced to fight.  The virtually rotted out husk of a tree lies just
above the surface of the water, creating the perfect breeding ground for
millions of small, irritating bugs.  The water seems to deepen even more
to the north, while brambles cut off any chance of moving to the south. 
The only possible routes are to the east and west, both appearing to
travel yet further into different portions of the swamp.

Tireth's Swamp~
The cliffs that form the walls that surround this swamp are once again in
full view, both to the west and the north.  A large boulder lies here
partially submerged in the water; the smell of decay permeates the air
coming from the small shape that has been dropped on top of the rock.  A
white film floats atop the stagnant water, bubbling up as gaseous pockets
form beneath it.  The cliff appears to be accessible to the north, and
the swamp to the east.
~
[Starshine] hmm...would be interesting to have leaving actions in rooms 67513 and 67511 into here that say something like - you leave <direction> and end up next to a giant boulder.

The Base of A Scorched Cliff~
The granite cliff once again dominates your view, sweeping around from
the west, the formation is a perfect natural alcove.  Reminiscent of a
painter's sweeping brush strokes, scorch marks have been burned into the
rocky heights.  The patterns of the burn marks lead you to believe that
the rock has been damaged from some explosive force emanating from higher
up on the cliff.  A fine layer of silt floats on top of the stagnant
water near the rock wall, thinning out as the swamp opens up to the south.

Tireth's Swamp~
Disappearing beneath shadowy clouds, a vast ocean of murky water devoid
of plant life spans out to the east.  Great tangles of vines and
half-rotted tree roots underneath the surface of the water force you to
move at a snail's pace for fear of falling headfirst into the murky
water.  Slight ripples radiate out through the swamp water away from your
feet, displacing a thin green crust that has settled atop the water.

The remains of long dead trees, coupled with the still very strong vines

This thin crust seems to be extremely fragile.  As the water ripples under

to be weak as death comes with the faintest touch.

A definitive slope to the ground towards the south is evident here.  The
level of the water certainly follows the slope and appears to deepen
along with the slant.  As the depth of the water increases the ground
underfoot seems to soften with it.  Spotted clumps of odd-looking green
moss seems to be growing on top of the water here and in much greater
quantities on the vast ocean of swamp water to the south.  The only
traversable paths seem to be a slight incline to the east and the path to
the west, either way edging the nearby oceanic depths of stagnant water.

without sinking.  Some of the ground here is above the water level,
although large puddles of swamp water pollute the grounds around you, most
connected by small river-like trickles of murky water.  The grounds to
the south quickly disappear beneath the seemingly endless, ever-deepening
ocean of stagnant water.  A small patch of rock rises up out of the

Blackened Battlefield~
This small plateau of rock sits just above the stagnant waters of the
swamp.  Blackened and scorched, the rock shows evidence of having melted
under some extreme heat.  To say a massive battle occurred here would be
an understatement; shattered weapons and breastplates litter the area. 
Scorched flesh still adheres to a few of the breastplates and the
blackened rocks littering the area.  Looking down over the sides of the
rock, no slope can be detected, giving the impression that a mighty force
pulled the rock out of the dark swamp itself.  The only apparently
traversable path is back to the north, leading once again into the swamp.

Little natural light is able to filter through the roiling cloud hovering
around and above you.  The combination of scattered light and natural
rock crevices adds a mystery to the granite cliff.  Many cracks and small

E
cliff hole void~
A five foot wide hole leads directly into the face of the cliff.  Scorch
marks surround the opening, filling some of the natural crevices with a fine
soot.
~
E
crevices cracks~
These small crevices appear to be natural formations caused by the
weathering of an imperfect rock face.  Most of these are half full of
soot and granulated rock, that was probably created when the void was
blasted out of the cliff face.
~
E
swamp~
A feeling of dread begins to creep over you as you stare out over the
dismal swamp that looms before you.  The watery ground, held in the dark
shadows created by the roiling cloud stretch out below you.
~
E
cavern~
A large cavern seems to be accessible just beyond the void that was
blasted out of the cliff face.  The contents of the cavern remain a
mystery since there is no light evident within.
~
E
roiling cloud~
As you stare up at the skies above you, the cloud continually shifts,
scattering the natural light and making it difficult to focus.  The cloud
appears to be a manifestation of the swamp gases and perhaps whatever
evil is lurking around.

Fire-Blackened Cavern~
The ground beneath your feet is warm, which is odd, as no fires appear to
have been set here for many months.  The air is absolutely calm, though
ash still swirls around as if caught in the memory of a windy night.  A
raised dais sits in a quiet corner of the cave, partially blocked by a
few boulders that have been displaced from the ceiling.  Set atop the
raised platform is a soot-covered, blackened altar.  A rune-inscribed
archway leads off to the north to what appears to be a faintly lit room,
while to the east is the ledge outside of the cave.

E
rune enscribed archway 1 north~
The archway has been carved directly out of the natural rock walls of
the cavern.  Heavily enscribed with runic sigils, the archway has a faint
@Bblue glow@n around some of the magical symbols.
~
E
sigils magical symbols~
The inscriptions are slightly more than a half-inch deep and seem to have
a powdery red substance sprinkled into them.  The most noticeable sigil
is a blazing lightning bolt that is carved directly at the top of the
runed archway.
~
E
dais corner~
This raised dais has been carved out of the natural rock of the cavern,
rising only about two feet in height and four feet around.  A scorched,
white marble altar has been set atop it, forcing a person to look up at
anybody that stands before it.
~
E
boulders rocks~
These boulders are much too large for anyone to even attempt to lift.
They appear to be simply large chunks of the ceiling and walls which have
separated and come crashing down to the floor.

Infernalist's Chamber~
@CSoftly glowing runes@n fill your sight as your gaze travels across the
walls of this chamber.  The runes etched into the natural cavern wall
seem to consume all light that threatens to dim their own.  An unnatural
@Bblue flame@n burns in the middle of the room, radiating oppressive heat
and little light.  Dark splotches stain the rock in many different places
surrounding the flame.  The only noticeable exit is to the south, through
the heavily runed archway.
~
mob # 2058 is summoned by the infernalist, - bound demon

The infernalist is a human, though his race is set to demon for the
purpose of his area attack not hurting him, as near as i can tell a
player will never see the difference, and it makes the attack much nicer.
[Starshine] more extras for the book would be nice.

glowing runes walls~
Intricate runes have been carved into almost every available surface of
the cavern walls.  Each is slowly pulsing with a pale light, no two of
these runes seems to be duplicated, though they each appear to be part of
a master sigil.
~
E
blue flame~
Emanating from a circular runic pattern, this small flame flickers at a
height of about two feet off the ground.  Oppressive heat fills the room
and as you near the flame, breathing becomes increasingly difficult.

Deep red in color, these splotches look very much like mostly coagulated

An Unstable Underground Cavern~
This cave appears to be part of a once larger cavern, as the walls all
around show evidence of cave-ins.  A small dark pool of water dominates
the middle of the room, and the only other noticeable object is a small
treasure chest sitting by the western wall.  Small bubbles surface
occasionally in the dark pool, perhaps evidence that there is some
circulation of the water in the pool.

E
cave-in cavern wall~
Great quantities of rubble ring this cavern in every direction.  Evidence
of cave-ins, both from the distant past and quite recently, prove that
this cave is far from stable.  A fine dust seems to be constantly falling
from the ceilings over what appears to be the more recent cave-ins.
~
E
boulder rock~
Glancing around the room, a single boulder takes precedence in your
thoughts.  This large boulder has fallen from the ceiling and landed
perfectly perched on top of the small chest.  Looking at the large
granite rock, it's easy to surmise that it would take quite a feat of
strength to move it.  Once moved, however, access to the treasures within
the chest would be feasible.
~
E
pool water~
Dominating the center of the room is a dark pool of water.  The pool,
aproximately 12 feet wide and twice that in length appears to be a
fathomless pit.  The dark waters seem to have a slight swirl to them, and 
small bubbles occasionally break its surface.

Inside the Wagon~
While tightly cramped, the inside of this wagon is quite practical.  A
small bed sits at the back of the wagon, while a four person table
dominates the center.  Surrounding the small table are two benches that
show little wear.  Cupboards line the wall directly adjacent from the
door that leads to the outside.  Small shutters have been nailed shut,
blocking any light from shining in through the window set just over the
small bed.
