Before the Sacred Well - Grove of Worship~
Tall oaks stand sturdily around a great clearing.  Their gnarled limbs
reach down gently, welcoming visitors to this holy place as the soft wind
causes their thick, twisted branches to whisper greetings to all
worshippers here.  Pale light breaks down faintly through the thick, dark
overhead canopy of leaves, speckling the grassy area all around the
sacred well with glowing patches of warm beauty.  It is quite shady
beneath the oaks; cool air brushes against you and carries upon it the
muted calls of songbirds from all across the island.
~
split acodes up between this and other rooms throughout the island so
they don't get all bunched up --caer

oaks branches twisted~
The old, gnarled trunks of these trees are wider than a man's arms can
stretch, yet for all their size they seem friendly, inviting you to
worship in their cool shade with quiet murmurings that drift down to you
from their wind-kissed branches.
~
E
clearing holy place grove~
Lush, dark grass lies in a soft carpet across the floor of this circular
clearing.  The thick trunks of oaks bend slightly toward the center of
the grove's open space, giving them the appearance of attending
solitiously to the holiness of the well and the worshippers who come here
to pray and meditate.  Light moves softly across the wind-teased grass,
causing warm patches of brilliance to dance atop the shaded clearing
floor.
~
E
light patches~
Warm, dusky light pushes its way through the thick branches and
whispering leaves of the ancient oaks to dot the floor of this holy place
in pale patches of warmth.  All along the well and surrounding grass,
patterns of light move in a quick dance that mesmerizes you.  The water
bubbling to the top of the sacred spring ripples gently with the subtle
force of the wind, causing the light to reflect upwards and mirror
shining patterns onto the underside of the leafy canopy above.
~
E
well spring pool sacred~
Flat, grey stones stacked tightly together form the sides of the circular
well.  Within its walls, water from a natural spring bubbles to the top,
cold and clear and free of impurities.  Water leaks out from between some
of the rocks and is carried down a narrow channel worn into the soft
earth during the course of many years.  The ground around the well is not
muddy; rather, it is covered with a thick, plush carpet of fine grasses
and clover.  Upon one of the rocks that create the sides of the well lies
a single pear, cut from top to bottom to expose the rich, white flesh,
the dark seeds and pale veins inside.
~
E
pear fruit vein flesh seeds~
Cut from top to bottom, the pear's juicy flesh lies open for inspection. 
You see the dark seeds lying in stark contrast to the heavy whiteness of
the fruit.  Threading through the white fruit are pale brown veins which,
when the pear is cut open this way, resemble an upside-down heart shape.

Before the Great House~
The pale light that has graced this island seems to glow more brightly,
outlining the large dwelling before you.  It seems as though a great
Presence is here, although of what is not evident.  A worn path, lined
with a haphazard arrangement of daisy, crocus and lily flowers leads to
the east.  To the south, a cobbled walkway leads into the center of the
community.  You see the buildings standing in loose formation around a
great tree to the far south.

Out of the Mists~
The mists no longer wrap themselves around you, and a pale, soft light
floats down to bathe you and your surroundings in a beautiful silver glow. 
A few scattered stones lie here in a random manner, yet to the north they
seem to form together in a cobbled pattern, creating a walkway to the
buildings you see in the northern distance.

A Small Clearing ~
The small, worn pathway ends here in a small clearing set back among the
oak trees that have started to encroach on the older corners of the
orchard.  One small pear sapling grows among the taller, intrusive oaks,
which seem to bend over the little tree protectively.  Beyond the oaks,
you hear the muted sounds of woodland animals as they move on the bed of
dried leaves on the forest floor.

figure female~
Was it a faerie, or a dark-haired girl?  You squint to see through the
darkness of the trees beyond this clearing, but you can make out nothing.
~
E
clearing~
Tall, old oaks line the sides of this small clearing in the back of the
orchard.  Lush, dark grass lies in a soft carpet across the floor of the
clearing, where light dances softly around the little pear tree.
~
E
small pear sapling~
Two ragged strips of soiled cloth bind the struggling sapling into an
upright position against a knotty wooden stake.  Its small leaves glow
slightly, as if enchanted, and its thin trunk emits a faint aura.  The
grass around the tree has been pulled back a bit, giving it more soil
from which to draw nourishment from unimpeded.
~
E
oaks trees~
The tall, thick oak trees around the clearing bend slightly, their
branches draping down as if to draw the tiny, struggling peach tree into
a protective embrace.

E
halfling~
From behind one of the great, old oaks a small female figure peeks out at
you.  She blinks twice, then ducks behind the gnarled trunk.  You hear
her moving quickly over to hide behind another tree, but you cannot see
her figure at all.
~
E
hum~
@GThe large oaks' leaves rustle slightly as the small pear sapling begins
to make a faint humming noise.@n 
~
E
hum2~
@GThe tiny leaves of the small sapling seem to vibrate, their glowing
surfaces quivering as the tree hums louder.  It seems as if it is trying
to summon someone...  or something.  @n 
~
E
halfling2~
Another crunch of leaves and twigs from behind yet another tree draws
your attention back to the presence of the small faerie halfling.  As you
watch, she slowly pokes her head out from behind the tree, then silently
stares at you, blue eyes wide with fear and curiousity.
~
E
enter~
@GThe tiny pear tree shudders once, the hum coming to an abrupt end.@n
  
The small halfling walks out from around the large oak, crooning softly
to the sapling, her fearful eyes never leaving yours.  She bends low,
stroking the shining leaves of the young peach tree with delicate
fingers, and looks up at you in wonder.
