Under the Wooden Dam~
Above your head is a ceiling of sticks carefully arranged and placed as
to minimize the amount of water that falls to the dirt floor.  On the
western and eastern walls mud-covered branches provide insulation from
the cold ground and a near watertight walkway.  Built into the wooden
ceiling is a hole leading to the inside of the dam.

An Underground Intersection~
The underground labyrinth splits into four different directions here. 
Small animal tracks lead off to the northern and southern paths, but
little evidence of travel exists on the eastern and western paths.
Poking through the weaved branches in the ceiling are several green weeds.

A Dead End~
Uncarved sticks lie scattered about the single-exit path.  All of the
branches still have their bark which are colored dark brown from all the
moisture that has been absorbed.  A few drops of water splash down from
the ceiling into a small puddle.  Across the surface of the puddle you
notice a gleaming light.

A Sharp Turn in the Dam~
Green weeds and moss poke out through crevices in the wooden south wall. 
Several of the branches making up the wall are broken allowing a steady
stream of ground water to flow out of the wall into a small channel of
water on the ground.  On the surface of the water are little bits of wood
which had been left on the ground.
