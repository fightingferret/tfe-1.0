Enterance to a large pier~
You are standing at the entrance to a large pier. There is a large
stone archway that has a cast iron gate which is blocking your
entrance to the pier.  It appears, that through some great effort,
someone or something has managed to bend the bars giving you access to
the pier.

Under a large pier~
You are standing in waist deep water under the large pier. Next to you stands a
large pillar that is used to support the pier. Although quite weather beaten,
the pillar seems to be quite sturdy.

On the large pier~
This is the begining of the large pier.  To the east you can make out the
end of the pier.  The pier is made of some type of wood, but it is far to
weathered to make a positive guess.  There are scales of all shapes and
sizes all over here.

You are standing about mid-way down the large pier. On both sides of you, you
notice railings that appear to be blood stained. You assume that they were
created by fisherman cleaning thier catch.....but who knows.

Broken part of pier~
There is a large hole in the middle of the pier here.  Judging by the
damage, you figure that the hole was created by a force from underneath
the pier.  what could have created such a hole.

Underneath the large pier~
The water here is quite nie. Not too cold and not too warm. As a matter of
fact, you barely notice that you are in water at all. looking down you notice
that you can see the bottom and schools of small fish swim beneath you.

you are swimming between two reefs. Though quite beautifull they prevent you
from swimming north or south.

The Northern Sea~
Your passage north and east is blocked by a reef that is full of marine life.
Looking more closely, you notice that the reef seems to be quite jagged and do
not question the damage it could do to you if touched. Small fish dart in and
------------
add surf surge action, hit reef for damage

Judging by white water, jumping off would not be an option.
