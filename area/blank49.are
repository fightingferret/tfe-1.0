Entrance Chamber~
The room is dimly lit by black candles resting in candelabras in the two
far corners.  Two uncomfortable-looking straight backed chairs sit on
either side of a small table by the east side of the room.  The walls are
covered by large tapestries in rich colors.  The ceiling is high above
head, and supported by buttresses that climb the walls, coming to a peak
at the highest point in the ceiling.  Two exits lead from this room, one
to the south and out of the tower, and one to the north, leading into the
main part of the tower.

table 1 east~
A small table covered with a black cloth sits against the east wall. 
Sitting on either side of it are chairs with straight back, covered in a
fine layer of dust.  Neither look to have been used in some time;
probably because they are as uncomfortable as they look.
~
E
tapestries walls~
The walls are covered with heavy tapestries depicting great wizards in
battle with curious and powerful beasts.  Great conflagrations of magical
fire and crackling energy cover the landscape and figures in the picture.

Central Chamber~
This room is round, following the curve of the tower, and the ceiling is
high.  The walls stone and heavily engraved with fantastic carvings of
angels and daemons.  The flat ceiling is supported by four broad pillars,
which are also heavily carved.  A huge crystal ball sits by one pillar,
resting in a gilded stand.  In the center of the room, between all the
pillars, is a patch of bare earth surrounded by a stone ring.  Four exits
leave from the room, a door to the south, north and west, and a stairway
leading up to the east.

A cloudy, inky black and ivory white glow comes from the insides of the
ball.  It hurts your head to look at the ball for too long.  Just before

room full of light.

E
ring stone earth dirt~
The center of the room is bare dirt, about 1 foot above the surrounding
floor.  It is contained by a ring of stone, like a flower bed with no

Tower Entrance~
A small clearing allows the sky to look down at this area.  Before you
stands the entrance to the tower, a huge, heavy wooden door.  On it is a
symbolic picture of the cardinal elements of magic: fire, water, air, and
earth.  An impassable wall of rock sits to the south, blocking travel and
view.  To the east and west the path wanders off into the trees.

door entrance picture cardinal elements~
The door is heavy and thick, made of a dark wood.  It is bound in iron
bands, and shimmers with a magical light.  Set in the center of the door
is a wheel shaped object that is divided into quarters.  The quarters
depict water, fire, air and earth, with fire and water in opposition and
similarly with air and earth.  The quartes blend with their neighbors,
and all come together to blend in the middle.  The very center of the
wheel is a perfect balance of all four magics.  This is the theory of
magic that this tower studies and promotes.
~
E
tower~
The tower stands before you, an impressive edifice built of seemingly
seamless black stone, reaching high into the sky.  Far, far above you
can see open windows, way up at the top.  Other than the windows the only
entrance you can see is the door just in front of to the north.
~

To the south with its bottom screened by a few trees you see a wall of
rock It has a sheer face and look to be quite impassable to all but the
birds of the sky.

To the east and west around the tower you see the dark forest.  A small
path heads from beneath one direction of the forest, past the towers
door, and on into the forest in the other direction.

Fire magics furnace.~
Heat blasts you as you enter the room.  A great fire rages in a furnace
on the north side of the room.  You see strange flickerings in the flames
in the furnace.  The walls and ceiling are bare stone, covered with soot
from the fire.
~
maybe add 2-3 puzzles that characters have to solve in order to get to
the custom spots?

Stairway.~
You stand at the base of a wide stairway.  Glossy black stone steps with
intricate carvings lead upward with a fine white railing to guide your
hand.  The stairs sweep around the outside of the tower and circle beyond
your sight.  An archway to the east opens out into a large room in the
interior of the tower.

A wide pool of water separates you from the north side of the room.  A

Air magics tower.~
This room is in the top of the tower.  It is open on all sides to wide
and tall window, letting in the elements.  In the center of the room
there is a stone table, marked with colorful glyphs and runic symbols. 
Above the table the air is wildly disturbed, as if nearly transparent
creature writhe about there.  You see the surrounding landscape through
the wide windows with a high vantage point.  The two exits from the room
are the windows, and back down to the staircase landing far below.

Three tanks of water dominate the room.  Two smaller ones sit on two
tables, containing exotic fish and strange eel-like creatures.  The third
is much larger, and has a rubber ducky floating in it.  The walls are

Wooded Path~
The trees about here grow thickly together in the west, but thin out
toward the east and north.  The ground cover of sharp bladed grass grows
similarly, thick beneath the forest to the west but thinning to clumps as
the ground changes from a dark soil to a more sandy ground.  A path leads
to the west through the trees, and turns to the north, wandering off and
disappearing into the sand.  Standing impressively above the trees to the
northwest is a tower, its spire pointing high into the sky.  To the east
and south, a rock wall stands blocking travel and view to the land beyond.

This area opens up to a wide flat plateau of cracked and split stone. 
Huge stones, weathered from wind and rain, stand as silent witness to
your passing.  They are scattered about in places, but in some they seem
arranged, as if in a grand pattern.  In the very center of the rock
strewn field stands a series of rectangularly shaped stones, stacked in
odd patterns.  They form a vague ring around a stone table.  To the east
and south, sheer rock faces show through a shimmer of powerful magic.

snow-topped mountains and deep valleys.  A trail of sorts passes between

A constant gusting wind tugs at you as you travel through this area.  A

spots of soil held in the creases of the rocks.  A faint path wanders
between the large stones and outcroppings of rock, passing east-west

dominates the area to the north.  The path to the east leads to the Tower

A low ceiling hangs over your head, a plain stone slab resting on the

on the table.  In the rear of the room a heavy winch is set up with heavy
chains running on pulleys out to the gate.

Cliff's Edge~
Wind whistles between the rocks from the updraft of the valley.  A
scattering of trees stubbornly force their roots between the rocky
surface of this area.  A path of sorts meanders between boulders and past
the trees, turning north and east from here.  To the south is a cliff
overlooking a wide valley, to the north is a thickening forest.  The view
to the west is dominated by a mountainous face.

Rocky ground~
The path wanders generally north and south between large outcroppings of
stone and a scattering of large trees.  Large stones poke out of the
ground, which is primarily dark soil growing grass and weeds.  At one
point along the path you see a large patch of matted down plants,
possibly the bed of a very large animal.  Also, deep-set tracks of some
heavy unknown animal litter the ground.  The way east is blocked by a
sheer wall of stone.  The path continues north and south from here.  To
the west more trees appear, but you seem unable to head in that direction.

Forest Path Crossing~
The path splits here, going to the north, east, and south from here.  The
ground is quite wet, and slopes downward to the north, becoming more
marshy in that direction.  To the south the path continues into drier
forested areas.  To the east you see the Tower spire pointing to the sky
through a break in the forest cover.

The ground bounces under your feet as you walk about this area.  You
notice that if you walk close to any of the few trees that grow here they
wave crazily with each footstep.  The ground is actually the roots of the
trees all gnarled together covering the mud underneath.  Large patches of
open mud lay in wait for the unwary traveler to step into them.  A
noxious gas bubbles up from the mud, splattering it about.

about where the roots do not grow together.  To the west and north, the

Huge stone doors hang on thick metal hinges attached to stout stone

either side.  The ground drops away sharply on both sides of the path, a
long drop down to the valley floor.  To the south the path follows a
