Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
Looking about the area, you can see why this place is named the Black
Wastes.  Black, scorched ground lies all around you as far as the eye can
see with an occasional interruption by a burnt tree stump or large
boulder.  Absolutely no plant life can be seen and no water sources are
in view.  Sweat beads off your brow as an incredible heat assaults you,
making your skin crawl.

Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
A stone wall lies on each side of the road preventing you from straying
from the path and winding up completely lost in this nightmarish place. 
A dead silence covers the area only occasionally broken by the sound of a
howling wind.  A small, stone hut composed of black-white quartz stones
lies directly off to the east.

E
stone wall~
The small stone wall that borders each side of the road is only about a
foot and a half high as the other portions have collapsed from disrepair. 
The wall could have possibly once served as a marker for caravans
venturing in to the land to help them stay on the road and not wander off
into the unknown.
~
E
small hut~
The small stone hut is nothing fancy, composed of simple quartz slabs
stacked on top of each other.  A small square opening covered by a piece
of cloth looks to serve as a door.  A small amount of light peeks around
the cloth suggesting someone may dwell there.

Black Wastes - Inside a Small Stone Hut~
This stone hut is composed of many slabs of alternating black-white
quartz stones.  A few crude shelves have been placed along the eastern
wall covered with several small trinkets.  A table made from the blackest
obsidian lies in the center of the room and is covered with several
loaves of bread and a small rusty chalice filled with water.  On the
eastern wall lies a small fireplace with a soup kettle hanging just above
the flames.  A tattered piece of cloth hangs on the western wall, acting
as a door.  A heavy iron trapdoor is set into the floor.

crude shelves~
The shelves are of a crude nature, nothing more then warped wooden planks
hammered in to the wall.  Several small items lie atop them, a rusty
shield, a brass candleholder and the skull of what looks like a goblin.

E
table obsidian~
The table has been carved from a single slab of obsidian, the blackest
you have ever seen.  Only a few loaves of bread and a rusty chalice lie
on it.
~

fireplace~
The fireplace is rather crude, nothing more then a hole in the wall with
a small chimney rising up from it.  A small soup kettle dangles over the
flames, bubbling with some stew the owner could possibly be calling food.
~
E
trinkets~
These small trinkets seem to have been collected over the years by the
inhabitant of this small hut.  Among them are a rusty double-bladed axe,
a brass candleholder, a silver spoon, and the skull of some large
humanoid.
~
E
holes~
There are three holes situated around the heavy iron trapdoor.  Each one
is shaped differently.  The first is thin, about as big around as a stick
of incense.  The second has a more triangular shape, like a prism, and
the third hole is completely square.

Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
The blackened remains of trees lie off the road to the north and west as
far as you can see.  A fierce wind rushes around you sending a whirlwind
of sand and small stones about the area.  To the west in the middle of
the remaining trees is a deep hole which possibly at one time could have
been a cool lake.

Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
The dull, lifeless terrain of the wastes can be clearly seen from this
vantage point as you look out into a land void of any color except that
of yellowish sand, blackened tree stumps and grey rocks.  Lying in the
middle of the road are the bleached bones of some poor soul who wandered
too far into the wastes and fell victim to its deadly powers.  Whirlwinds
of sand rip through the room, assaulting your exposed flesh in a stinging
attack.

Upon the ground are the remains of deep wagon ruts which suggest that
this was once a well-traveled path.  Broken and rusty wagon wheels lie

nothing more then a skeletal remain of their once colorful life.  The

with no end in sight.

The flat, barren landscape of the wastes is interrupted by a rolling hill
off to the north which rises up a good bit and drops down out of sight,
but other than that it is just a desolate waste.  The distant sound of an
explosion reaches your ears as it echoes throughout the area but looking
around you cannot identify its source or direction.  A few withered weeds
dot the road's surface only to further the impression of death and
tragedy of the area.

A dense steam begins to rise from the road as you notice deep cracks in

which the wind quickly blows away.  To the south the road appears to be
rather rocky as you notice large boulders partially blocking the path but

Several large boulders stick out from the road's edges partially blocking

of the boulder's faces lie deep cuts and scratches.  Looking closely it
looks as if a message was written upon a few of the boulders.  The ground

Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
A permanent shadow seems to cover the area like a blanket as storm clouds
gather overhead, swirling with intensity and blocking out the sun's rays. 
Loud rumblings and the sounds of thunder claps echo throughout the area
breaking the silence.  To the north the road climbs quite steeply up the
hillside.

Black Wastes - A Desolate Road Across the Wastes~
The road surface here is mainly composed of black rocks, like those made
from cooled lava.  As you walk along you kick up clouds of dust from the
ash-like dirt causing you to cover your eyes or become blinded.  Looming
over the rolling sand dunes to the southeast you spy a massive black
tower rising up from an enormous dark forest.  The road continues on a
straight course to the north, while to the south it starts to bend out of
view.

Waves of black ash fall from the sky creating a dark and stuffy mess
which completely obscures your vision.  With each step you take you
blindly bump into objects you cannot identify.  Every few moments the
rain of ash slows down long enough to see that to the north it appears
thinner and would probably offer a better view of where you are.  To the
south the road continues through the wastes and the rain of black ash
seems thinner.

The clouds hanging overhead drop black volcanic ash upon the area but the
ash seems to be raining down worse to the south of here.  Each time you
try and breath you cannot help but inhale ash causing you to cough from
the irritation.  Along with the ash, glowing red embers drop from the
clouds hissing and smoking as they dig deep into the ground.

From this vantage point you gain a better view of the surrounding area as
you see the desert continue for miles.  Off to the west and south the
dull, colorless terrain of the desert runs for miles.  To the east the
colorless terrain is broken as lush green tree tops break the pattern. 
The road continues to climb up the hillside to the east while to the
south it declines back toward the foothills.

Looking onward you notice that you cannot see the end of the road or a

The road continues to bend, twist and snake its way through the terrain
causing your feet to ache as you constantly lose footing on the uneven
surface.  A crude stone wall which may have once stood a bit sturdier
lines the road and breaks at regular intervals only to pick back up again.

quite smooth, making travel a bit easier.  Off to the north a ways you

Black Wastes - Road Along the Blackened Forest~
Dead trees lie fallen across the road surface causing you to have to
climb over them to continue in either direction.  Directly to the south,
a large wooden gate rises up from the tightly spaced trees of the forest;
from this point you cannot make out any other details about it.  To the
north the road continues to bend out of view as it skirts along the
forest's edge.

Black Wastes - Before a Towering Wooden Gate~
Directly to the south a massive wooden gate rises up from between the
rows of blackened trees.  A silvery rune has been etched across its
surface which glows faintly.  At the top of the gate lies a stone arch
with the statue of a elven maiden with a longbow in her hands.  A harsh
wind blows through the area making the trees bend and crack as if ready
to topple over at any second.  The road to the north is covered in piles
of dead trees and looks unpassable.

A low, ghostly moan floats through the area, rising up from the trees
around you.  All about you lie decaying trees rittled with holes from
termite hordes chewing away at the wood.  The feeling of a watchful eye
being laid upon you seems to stick with you with every step you take. 
The black, twisted trees slump over in places causing you to have to duck
and weave to continue walking.

This section of forest seems to house an abundance of the blackened trees
which seem all too familiar in this sinister place.  The ground below
looks more like ash then that of normal, healthy dirt.  Trees wrap around
each other as if trying to destroy each other.  The tree's thick black
bark has been shaped into the form of a face which casts a spine-chilling
glance towards you.

Blackened Forest~
The true feeling of decay gives way as you notice that most of the trees
to the west are on the verge of toppling over and a few look as if they
have been snapped like a small twig.  Overturned trees scar the landscape
giving the sense of decay and death as no life seems to remain here
anymore.  A small footpath works its way to the west, through the twisted
maze of decaying trees.

Blackened Forest~
The trees seem to space out here, varying between lush, green trees and
their black and twisted counterparts.  An almost perfect line is drawn
down the middle of the forest; to the east green grass and colorful
flowers while to the west is a picture of a colorless maze of black and
twisted trees.  To the south a small path heads down through the maze of
trees.

Blackened Forest~
The ground here is bare, devoid of all life except green grass.  Small
withered vines creep up into the grass from the west side of the forest
while newly-bloomed roses try to grow over on the east side.  Off to the
northwest you catch a glimpse of a massive wooden gate rising up between
the rows of trees.

The mirror image of the forest is clearly seen here: to the east is the
green, life-filled section, while off to the west the landscape darkens
as blackened trees rise up in clusters.  The two sides of the forest seem
almost as if guided by two separate powers of nature, one light, one dark.

Rising up at least 30 feet in the air stands a great oak tree.  Healthy,
green leaves hang from its branches along with several small birds nests. 
A light green moss grows on the tree's bark but seems to not hinder its
amazing growth.  A small tree stump lies next to the towering tree
offering a hard but relaxing seat to rest on.

Blackened Forest - Path Along the Black Tree Grove~
A small row of stone lines the path making it a bit easier to not stray
off course.  The trees to the west seem thick with moss and twisted vines
creating a dark mess and distorted image of what a true forest would look
like.  Decaying trees rise up around you in every direction, covered by a
thick, black moss which seems to devour its remaining bark.

Several of the trees here are hollowed shells of their former lives,
while others seem to resist the effects of decay and hold onto their last
bit of life.  A few blades of grass rise up from within the black soil,
suggesting that the forest life is once again fighting to survive.

The path bends sharply here, heading off to the north and west into the

The humid climate makes for an unpleasant journey and you constantly tire
from the incredible heat.  Looking up, only the black tree tops reveal
themselves, as they block out any light trying to enter the forest.

Blackened Forest~
The thick tangle of intertwined trees bars passage to the eastern section
of the forest, leaving only three distinct paths to follow.  Thick
redwood trees tower up above you but are now nothing more then hollowed
out shells of their former lives as termites eat away the last vital
remains.  No distinct paths can be seen upon the ground but small
clearings to the north, west and south may allow further passage through
the forest.

Decaying pine trees tower up above you, their once green needles now lie
in a heap upon the ground, brown and brittle.  Black sap runs out from
holes in the trunks, oozing down to the ground creating a sticky mess. 
Breaks in the trees span in all directions, but there is no real
variation and it becomes apparent that you could lose you bearings in
here quite easily, if you were to move at all.

The sap is quite thick, but unlike maple sap that would ooze from a tree

creating a sticky mess.

Blackened Forest~
The trees along the eastern side of the forest here are mere hollowed-out
shells now, caused by the decaying disease of the forest.  Several holes
scar the tree's surface, caused by the termites and other insects that
have eaten away at the wood.  Piles of dead leaves cover the floor making
a crackling sound as you walk across them.  A small set of tracks leading
off to the west are barely visible.

other parts of the forest these look as if they were chopped down by an

Gravestones bearing crude inscriptions stand scattered about the area.  A

A dense fog rolls through the trees dropping your visibility down to
about three feet.  With every step you take you always seem to bump into
a tree; your movement slows to a crawl.  Thick and twisted vines wrap
around the trees and cover the ground further obstructing your path. 
Narrow paths attempt to pass through the trees leading out to the north,
east and west.  To the south the trees have become tightly bunched
together, barring passage in that direction.

Blackened Forest~
The ground level raises up a bit here, like a gentle rolling hillside.  A
grove of decaying trees lie just to the west a bit, their dead remains
blocking passage in that direction.  To the north a grove of blackened
trees run the length of a small path that has been worn into the ground. 
To the east the forest is shrouded in a dense layer of mist and fog. 
Directly to the south the trees have become bunched together tightly,
blocking passage in that direction.

The towering black trees of the forest cast a dark shadow about the area. 
Unrecognizable shapes appear to be moving throughout the murky forest but
every time you glance around you notice they are gone.  The sound of a
twig snapping occasionally breaks the silence of the wood but as you spin
around you can see nothing in sight.  The black, ash-like soil blows
around in tiny whirlwinds as a slight breeze blows through the area.

An eerie feeling of someone watching you assaults your senses but you can

the air as you cannot hear any sounds except that of your own breathing
and footsteps.  The ground before you is covered with deep ruts like
those made by a large wagon carrying a heavy load.

Fog rolls in from the depths of the forest to the east, clouding your

only seems to make the fog thicker and the ground feels like that of a
marsh rather then a forest floor.  A gentle splashing sound echoes

The twisted and decayed trees are so thickly entangled it seems they must
have choked the life out of each other in their efforts to reach the
sunlight.  Even the vines present on most of the dead stumps have stayed
near the ground as though they wished to avoid touching the strangling
branches.  To the north and west, the trees and dead vines tangle
together to make pushing through them impossible.  Only slightly less
dense to the south and east, the dried husks of the trees seem to close

Decaying trees crowd together in this section of the forest.  Each tree

A carpet of low fog rolls along the forest just above your knees and

Many hollowed out trees lay propped up against each other as their roots
have become far too weak to support their massive weight any longer. 
Deep claw-like marks scar some of the decaying trees' faces made by what
could be a bear or some other creature but by the size of the marks it
looks as if as if the creature was quite large.

Blackened Forest~
The lifeless scene of the forest spans out all around you, the only sign
of life being the black and twisted trees which rise up around you. 
Every few minutes the sound of a decaying tree finally snapping and
toppling over echoes through the forest; otherwise, it is unnaturally
quiet.  Piles of dead twigs lie in heaps on the forest's floor, reduced
to nothing more then dry, brittle wood.

Blackened Forest - Within a Decaying Glade~
The constant scraping of dry branches and the rattle of dead vines fill
the area as a breeze blows through what must have been a lovely glade. 
Here and there, scattered clumps of a brittle yellow grass hang
tenaciously to the ash-like soil.  The vines are thin here, mainly
clinging along the bottoms of the twisted trees.  From the battered
fibers and dry tendrils evident on the ground, the wind seems to have
flailed the vines from the rotting trees.

Blackened Forest~
Various trees in different stages of decay hug onto life dearly as the
massive black and twisted trees rise up over them, draining the
life-giving nutrients from the soil.  Traces of flowers remain on the
forest floor but are now only brown, dead skeletons of their former state. 
The eerie silence of the forest is ocassionally broken as a rush of wind
blows through the wood, causing a few decaying trees to snap and fall to
the ground becoming nothing more then a pile of splinters.  A cloud of
dark mist hovers just above the ground here, slowly rolling off towards
the south.

A strong breeze blows through the forest every few moments, sending a few

The patches of dry and dead leaves which litter the forest floor make a
crackling sound as you step across them.  Hollowed out trees stand
everywhere you look, just on the verge of collapsing.  Termites swarm
over a few dead tree stumps on the ground, gnawing away at what little
living wood is still left.  A strong smell of burning wood rises up from
a few of the trees and a few have been reduced to nothing more than a
pile of black ash.

Blackened Forest~
Mounds of soil span across the forest here, looking more like graves than
any natural occurance.  From beneath one of the mounds of soil, a hint of
metal sparkles in the light.  Directly to the east a cloud of dense fog
rises up from a circle of blackened trees, clouding the area as it rolls
along the forest's floor.

Blackened Forest~
Uprooted trees lie scattered all around you, looking as if some great
force had grabbed them and tore them from the ground.  Hollowed-out trees
stand at tilted angles, kept upright by leaning on a few blackened
fellows.  Small footpaths work their way through the intertwined mess of
trees but seem to lead on further into the maze of the forest.  Off to
the southeast a cloud of fog billows up from the ground, obscuring part
of the forest.

Blackened Forest~
Besides the buzzing of an occasional termite, the silence in this barren
aste seems complete.  A light breeze blows through the forest causing the
branches of the decaying trees to crackle and snap.  The low creak and
moan of slowly falling trees occasionally echoes through the area as
though lamenting the passing of such a vibrant center of life.

Piles of crumbled stone lie scattered about the forest floor here,
remains of some stone structure that stood here long ago.  Thick tangle
vines cover the remaining stone, which is just barely visible beneath
several layers of vines, brush and soil.  A dense fog rolls in from the
west section of the forest and dark shapes seem to move from within it. 
Off to the east you spy the remains of white marble stone walls rising up
from within the rows of blackened trees.

The piles of stones are covered with thick vines, brush and soil and

An occasional snap of a twig, crackle of dry leaves or the loud thud of a
decaying tree finally snapping and tumbling to the ground breaks the
eerie silence of the forest.  The blackened trees loom around you in
every direction; their twisted bark making it seem as though they had a
face which peers sinisterly towards you.  Footprints in the soil suggest
someone or something has passed through here recently but the tracks are
indistinguishable to you as their outline has been distorted.

Several piles of small stones lie in heaps about the area.  Thick,

The bleached white skeletal remains of many small woodland animals lie
upon the ground, unable to escape the fate which befell the forest.  From
beneath the pile of animal bones a thick fog rises up, covering the area
like a blanket.

As you walk through the groves of decaying trees, clouds of the dusty
soil fly up into the air causing you to cough as you inhale the small
grains.  Looking around you notice some trees still have green leaves
upon their branches.  Massive roots from the thousands of trees in the
forest pop up from beneath the ground and converge here in a tangled mess.

Blackened Forest~
Dry, black soil blows through the air as the plant life that once held it
in place has decayed.  Trees lean at odd angles; their dead roots pulled
free from the lifeless soil.  Decimated vines cling desperately to the
blackened stumps of rotting trees as well as lining the ground in a
tangle of dry fibers.  Here and there lie piles of damp, rotting leaves,
not yet disturbed by the biting winds that occasionally gust through the
area.

The forest looks as if all the color was drained away from within it; the
only remaining colors seem to be that of the black trees and the dull
brown of the decaying trees.  The twisted and distorted blackened trees
of the forest tower overhead, casting their dark shadows upon the forest. 
The ground is completely obscured by a thick mist which rolls along just
above your ankles.

The dull scenery of the forest goes on forever in every direction you
look.  The never ending rows of blackened trees, decaying trees and
massive tangles of vines seem to bar your path wherever you look.  The
forest is eerily silent; the only sound that can be heard is that of your
own footsteps.  No matter in which direction you choose to go it seems as
if you are heading into the same dark section of the forest.

Fragments of dead trees buried for years stick up from beneath the black
soil.  Sharp thorn bushes sprout up from the ground bearing viciously
sharp thorns from their black branches.  A gentle cracking sound echoes
through the forest as you walk over the many dead trees which collapse
beneath your weight.  Off to the east a bit you spot a cloud of
semi-transparent fog rising from the ground.

Several piles of dead leaves lie scattered about the ground and look as

the ground and look as if they would snap and turn to dust with the
slightest amount of pressure placed on them.  A few dried acorns lie on
the ground, dropped from the decaying trees which could no longer support
their life.  The forest continues in all directions giving you no clear
path to follow.

Towering black pillars of dead wood are all that remain of the once

together as their roots slowly rot away.  Vines join the strangled press
of branches, though they are as dead as the trees they are bound to. 
Heavy clouds of mist billow around you carrying a heavy odor of rot and

horribly twisted.  Dead shrubs lie along the ground, their brittle

Blackened Forest - A Deathly Quiet Path~
Blackened trees hang alongside this small footpath, casting a dark shadow
across the trail.  The trees slowly sway back and forth like a constant
breeze were blowing but the air is still and deathly quiet.  Small stone
walls line the edges of the path, rising up to a height of three feet. 
Looking around you, all you can see are the black trees which stand
together so closely that they block out all sunlight and obscure your
vision to the north and south.  To the east the footpath continues down
the decline of a small, rolling hill.  To the west a mass of lopsided
trees stand at various angles, their roots obviously weakened by disease.

Blackened Forest - A Deathly Quiet Path~
Many piles of multi-colored leaves lie scattered about the path here,
drifting slowly off a few lush, green trees that stand directly to the
east.  Directly to the north and south of the path the battle between the
black, twisted trees and the lives one can be clearly seen as each wraps
around the other in an attempt to take over the plot of soil.  The crude
cobblestone wall continues to run along the edges of the path to the east
and west, interupted every few feet by a small gap.  To the east the path
continues into a lush, green lively forest while to the west it proceeds
into the groves of blackened trees.

Blackened Forest - A Deathly Quiet Path~
Lush, green birch, oak, and elm trees overhang the path here, swaying
gently back and forth like a breeze were blowing.  Small bushes, each
full of ripe, red berries, line the edges of the footpath behind the
cobblestone wall.  Dominating the southern edge of the path are two
massive redwood trees, each measuring at least fifteen feet across. 
Scattered about the path are small acorns, hazelnuts and walnuts, most of
which have been cracked open and their meat taken away.  To the east the
path drops down the hillside at a great angle while to the west it climbs
up towards a dark section of the forest.

Blackened Forest - A Deathly Quiet Path~
Rising up in the center of the footpath is a giant obsidian pillar,
covered in elegant flowing runes which glow with a bright yellow aura. 
Planted around the base of the pillar are several tulips, roses and
violets all of which are in full bloom and waft a sweet aroma into the
air.  To the south several tall pine trees stand at a slight angle which
causes them to overhang the pillar.  To the north the trees are more
spaced, giving a glimpse outside to the bleak, colorless desert terrain. 
The small footpath continues to the east and west from here, working its
way between the groves of trees.

Blackened Forest - Before a Great Circle of Stones~
Large oak trees, filled with multi-colored leaves, stand along the edges
of this large clearing.  Within the clearing a mighty circle of white
marble stones has been placed, each with a rune etched upon its surface. 
Planted along the exterior of the stone circle are several white roses
which send a sweet-smelling aroma wafting through the air.  At the far
end of the circle to the east a large, white and gray-streaked granite
marker, outlined by a fiery red glow, has been placed.  The ground before
the circle is litter several sets of tracks which look to be from a horse. 
To the west a granite archway leads back out to a small footpath and away
from the circle.

Slowly Sinking in Quicksand~
Walls of sand rise up in every direction giving you little chance of
escaping this trap.  A swirling mound of sand below you slowly drags you
deeper in to the pit and no amount of struggling seems to stop your
descent.  A few rays of light break through the sand above you but soon
begin to vanish from sight as the sand covers your eyes.

Blackened Forest - Within a Hollowed-out Tree Trunk~
This hollowed-out tree trunk is amazingly large.  It runs about twenty
feet towards the north and the ceiling is about six feet above you. 
Thick, greenish-colored moss clings to the decaying bark shedding an
unnatural green glow into the log.  The stench of rotting flesh fills the
trunk and you notice it comes from at least a dozen decaying dew sprites
which litter the floor.  To the west a small opening leads back into the
decaying forest.
