Narrow Path~
This narrow corridor winds through the sandstone.  Tall and narrow, the
tunnel is like a chimney, reaching high above to open up at the surface
of the Narak Desert.  A soft breeze carries sands from above.  To the
west is a large slab of sandstone.  The corridor heads east.

This narrow sandstone tunnel heads south and west.  Sharp limestone jut

Bend in Narrow Path~
So narrow that anyone passing through here must move single-file, and
turned sideways at that, this caverns turns north and east. 
Bleached-white bones lie half-buried in the sand.  The shriek of a
buzzard echoes far overhead, answered by more shrieks.

Crude pictures, done in an almost childish hand, have been chipped into
the sandstone.  Parts of the walls have broken away, however, leaving
gaping holes in many of the pictures.  This entire canyon seems unstable,
rocks bouncing down the walls, knocking loose pebbles and powdery tufts
of sand.  The corridor heads straight to the west and toward and bend to

These tables are heavy in construction - stone banded at the edged with
thick iron.  They seem to be made to take severe damage.

beakers flasks liquids~
Burned on their bottoms, oily on their insides, these beakers and flasks
are suffering from neglect.  The colored liquids in some of them are
smoking and bubbling, and in some cases warping the glass in which they
are contained.

East in the Hall of Learning~
This long hall stretches far to the west, though just a short way to the
east the hall ends.  The walls are carved with large, goblin-like faces,
which look in the hall with cold, slitted eyes.

Graduate Student Barrack~
The beds here are large, even somewhat ornate.  They are carved of wood
and and inlaid with brass runes of varying shapes and sizes.  On the west
wall are three wash basins - filled, polished and wiped dry around the
edges.  To the east the barrack continues, and on the north wall is a
massive wooden door fitted with a sign.

Student's Quarters~
The student's quarters of Mangar's Rampant Destruction Team is a sorry
affair of stained walls, unmade bunkbeds, and discared laundry.  Various
books, bent and dog-eared, litter the floor.  On the west wall is a
wash-basin, which looks as if it hasn't held water for fifty years.  The

Graduate Student Barrack~
These barracks are orderly and well-organized - the beds made, the floors
mopped, the walls polished to a high shine.  Except for the beds,
however, this room is empty.  It would seem as though graduate students
don't own much.  On the south wall is a heavy door, and to the west the

Braided silken cords hang against the walls alonside large paintings, all

"Is there any more reason for a man to be proud?  More and more goblins

incredible speed.  The students progress nicely - they are stupid, but
they know how to handle a sword.  I am proud of them.  Soon, so soon the
day will come when my army and I shall step through the gate and drop
upon the unsuspecting townsmen.  Our marching will be as thunder through
the realms.  Not bad for the kid who flunked out of mercenary school."

The Shimmering Gate~
A huge, shimmering disc of light dominates this small room.  Thousands of
colors bend and writhe inside the surface of the disc, which gives off a
low hum.  The disc stands upright, as if it were a hole in the air. 
Around the walls are shelves and heavy, iron-banded strongboxes.  On the

Floor of a Pit~
This pit seems hastily dug - the walls are of crumbly sand, the floor is
uneven and littered with rocks.  The pit reeks of bodily odor, and the
floor is soggy with various putrid liquids.  A green, fetid miasma chokes
the air, floating to the room above.  An incredibly heavy iron chain has
been riveted into the wall.  The chain is just long enough to reach from
one side of the pit to the other.
