Cave Entrance~
The smooth floor of the cavern has been heavily traveled, the stalagmites
smoothed and broken by the passage of multitudes of people over the
centuries.  The curved ceiling vaults high above your head.  A smooth
stone ramp to the south leads out of the caves.  To the north, the cave
heads deeper into the mountains.

Soaring Cavern - South~
The high ceiling of the cave is covered with stalactites, many of which
have been broken and lie scattered about the floor.  The walls are pocked
brown stone, worn smooth over the ages.  A small passageway peeks from
behind some stalagmites on the western wall, but the main cavern heads
north.

Soaring Cavern - North~
The ceiling soars high above your head, stalactites dripping eerily from
the center.  The west wall is pocked with holes, and the east is covered
with brown moss.  A small tunnel leads north past some stalagmites,
while the cave continues south.

Living Tunnel~
The walls of this tunnel have been artificially widened, making them
smooth.  The floor is also smooth, lacking any stalagmites.  Time and
neglect, however, have allowed mold and small stalactites to form on the
ceiling.  The tunnel leads north and south.

Piles of rotting mining gear attest to the countless years this area

The detritus of years of mining lays rusting on the floor.  A small
archway leads north, while tunnels carved into the solid rock lead east
and west.  The ceiling is damp, and moss and molds cover the walls and
ceiling.  You can hear faint noises echoing off the tunnel walls, hinting
at movement somewhere nearby.

work on the walls.  The timbers have somehow remained dry and withstood

Mine Tunnel~
Cobwebs blanket the tunnel to the north, hanging in dusty sheets from the
sturdy support beams.  The floor is smooth and grooved from the passage
of untold number of feet.  A small rivulet of water runs down its length
and into a crack in the floor.  To the south you hear the occasional
sound of a chain rattling.

Smaller Tunnel~
This tunnel is markedly smaller than those to the east.  The walls and
floor are roughly hewn from the stone, and the ceiling is low and
irregular.  Small rocks and stone chips litter the floor, making footing
difficult.  The tunnel curves north and leads back to the mine shaft east.

By the Underground River's Edge~
You are on the bank of a fast-flowing underground river.  A large
waterwheel spins quickly in the river's waters, turning a thick metal
shaft protruding from the south wall, just to the east of the tunnel
entrance.  The shaft is supported by metal and stone braces which creak
and groan as the shaft turns.  The roar of the water is almost deafening
as it echos about this cave, the fast-flowing water slamming into the
cave wall, just to the east of the tunnel and turning northward into the
darkness.

Fine ash covers the floor in this corner of the large room.  The rough

Blackened Mine Tunnel~
This small tunnel's walls are blackened by soot and coated with ash.  Ash
covers the floor too, disturbed by your passage.  The tunnel jogs to the
east, as well as emptying out into a room to the north.  Air moves
briskly by you into the tunnel to the north, carrying with it a strong
odor of death.  To the north you can see a large chamber with a stairway
that leads up into the enveloping darkness.

Cavern - South of the Underground Lake~
You are at the rocky shoreline of a small underground lake.  Just to the
northwest you can see a large bridge spanning the river.  To the far
north you see a dark opening in the cave wall just above the waterline. 
The caves walls rise steeply to the south and east.

In the Underground Lake - Shallows~
The shallow water of the lake edge is dark enough that you cannot see
more than a few inches down.  The calm water of the lake spreads out to
the north and northwest.  To the west a massive stone bridge cuts the
cavern in half, spanning the lake and heading into a tunnel on the north
side of the cavern.  On the north shore, on the wall of the cavern is a
small opening in the cave wall.

In the Underground Lake - Under the Soaring Bridge~
The deep and dark waters of the lake splash gently against the stone
supports of the bridge, the darkness of the water hiding its depth.  The
impressive stone span of the bridge soars above your head, blocking out
much of the light from the fungus on the cavern ceiling.  Just to the
west you see the lake is fed by the water cascading down the cavern's
western wall.  The lake spreads out to the east, dark and silent.  A
small drain pipe in the northern support spills water into the lake.

Grand Gallery~
High walls and a relatively narrow passageway create a feeling of grand
scale in this tunnel.  The ceiling must be at least twenty feet overhead,
and the tunnel about eight wide.  Worked into the stone of the walls, are
relief works of gnomish miners; each a different face.  The faces are
spread all about the chamber, the thousands of faces staring out at you. 
To the west is a large chamber, and to the east the hall continues.  A
small doorway framed by intricate stonework leads northward.

A larger tunnel leads to the south, sloping upwards noticeably.  To the

were once set into the stone, huge chunks of stone have been smashed
