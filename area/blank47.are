Under a Musty Hole~
You find yourself in a large hole dug under the base of a oak tree. 
Heading north and west into the darkness are the tracks of many animals,
the likes of which you've never seen above ground.  If you get on your
knees, you can crawl in those two directions, or you can rise and leave
the underground world.

hole base~
As you look up the great roots of the banyan tree arch to form the
support of this tunnel entrance.  The earth has been clawed and dug into
the depths of the earth.  Looking upward, you see a large hole which you
think you can climb back through.  A few of the roots hang down allowing
anyone to grab hold of them as a tool to climb out.

Warren Tunnels - T Intersection~
As you move through the tunnels, you see roots from the tree above
weaving their way along the ceiling.  The dank smell of wet clay nearly
overwhelms you.  A faint light glows far to the south; darkness extends
in all other directions.  The wall on your east is slick with water,
other directions seem open.

uninviting.  The damp atmosphere is filled with unpleasant smells, and
makes you feel cold and miserable.

The walls in this area of the tunnel are dark and grimy, and splattered
with blood.  Small bits of bloody fur lie on the ground, still wet and

most unpleasant.

Warren Tunnel - Scene of Death~
The smell in this room is terrible indeed.  The source of the smell is
quite obvious: the carcasses of dozens of animals lie scattered about the
floor.  The meat has not yet been removed from the skin, and flies feast
hungrily on their remains.

about the area, and bugs swarm to feast on the remains.

A faint light shines to the east.  The damp tunnels extend into darkness
both north and west, and you can see no indication of what lies ahead. 
The earth here is hard and packed, as if many feet often passed this way. 
A loose root sticks out of the southern wall.

Warren Tunnels - Low Area~
The ceiling in this area of the tunnel is lower, and the floor is made of
stone rather than dirt.  It seems quite likely that the diggers hit rock
and could go no lower; while making the ceiling higher might well cause
the room to be out in the open.  It is necessary to crawl in order to go
south; the way east is more open.

side by side.  The ground is a bit moist, and you can see the prints of
dozens of paws, heading in both directions.  The tunnel slopes sharply
down as it goes west; the ground to the east is on the same level.

The tunnel winds east and south, as it twists in the dark soil.  Several
abandoned bits of refuse lie on the ground, as if something other than
rabbits were here before.  A breeze from the east blows your hair, and
causes bits of the remnants to knock against themselves, filling the air
with a faint drumming sound.

This portion of the tunnel is wide, and the ceiling stands very high. 
The ceiling of the tunnel forms a small arch to the south; the way east
and west is wide and open.  The ground slopes sharply up to the east, and
drops towards the south.  Bits of rock show on the ground and ceiling,

Warren Tunnels - Moldy Ground~
The passage narrows here, as it turns north and west.  The ground here
really isn't ground -- it is covered with a carpet of light green mold. 
The mold is wet, and provides a very slippery surface for you to walk on. 
The walls are close together, providing a natural barrier to uninvited
guests or invaders.

Warren Tunnels - By a Crevice~
The tunnels curve east and south here, although a tiny crevice to the
north might just be passable, if you tried to squeeze your way in.  The
wall to your west is made of hard-packed clay, with flecks of dark rock. 
The earth beneath your feet is loose, and bits of gravel are mixed with
the dark earth.

Warren Tunnels - Rumbling Walls~
This small room is filled with the bones of many animals.  The walls are
dark, and seem close and threatening.  A faint rumbling can be heard in
the distance, and the ground reverberates.  You think perhaps it would be
wise not to linger in this spot.
~
might make a check vs searching for players each time they look in room
to notice unstable walls etc - skill checks for things like search etc
are good to code as it makes those skills more useful :) 
-------START PHULE
is this a death trap?  what about when a player comes in, leaves for 30
ticks, then comes back and misses all warning and is splatted?  make a
chari_in_room check.

The ground shakes and a large chunk of rock narrowly misses you as the
ceiling above the west wall partially collapses.  It would be well
advised to quickly leave this room as the ceiling does not appear even
slightly stable.

A large crack forms in the rock above you.  It is obvious that this
tunnel will not survive for more than a few seconds longer.  Pebbles and
rocks are already beginning to shower down upon you.  Staying here would
mean certain death due to the crushing weight of the ground above you.

Warren Tunnels - Puddle~
A small puddle lies at your feet, and small drops from up above slowly
drip down to add to the liquid.  In the soft, moist dirt you can see the
pawprints of many, many animals.  This pool shows signs of being a
popular drinking spot for all of the inhabitants.

Warren Tunnels - Near Some Holes~
The ground slopes off sharply here to the east, making it difficult to
stand upright.  Small holes appear in the sides of the tunnel, giving it
a curious, polka-dot appearance.  A faint light appears to the east; to
the west lies only darkness.

Warren Tunnels - Dead End~
Looking up, you can see that a root descends into this space, having
broken through the earthen ceiling.  The root has made a small crack, and
threatens to open this spot to the elements.  The only exit appears to
be back towards the west.
