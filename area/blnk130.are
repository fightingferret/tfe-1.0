Before an Opening Series of Sandstone Catacombs~
What stretches before you is little more than a tunnel that has been
burrowed through tons of grey sandstone.  The floor of the passage is
littered with grey, detrital sediment.  Set into the west and east walls
here are burial niches; within each you can make out the lines of a
shrouded corpse.  South, the catacombs branch outward to the east and
west while to the north you can see a strone ramp leading up.

E
floor grey detrital sediment~
The floor of the passage is covered lightly with grey sand.  Once part of
the ceilings, wall, and floor, the sandy grains have, over time,
weathered away from their original surfaces.  The sand has come to rest
in small, chaotic piles alone the floor.
~
E
small chaotic piles~
The piles of sand along the floor are much too small to conceal anything
or to be of interest.
~
E
burial niches shrouded corpses~
There are two burial niches in this part of the catacombs.  Both contain
shrouded corpses.  One alcove is set into the western wall and one in the
eastern one.

Sandstone Catacomb Intersection~
A network of tunnels branches off in all the cardinal directions from
this underground nexus.  Hollowed out of grey sandstone that has a much
finer texture than graywacke, these tunnels are fairly crude but
remarkably even.  Sand the color of blood collects in small, uneven piles
along the floor.  There are no burial niches along the walls here, but
you can see several off in the distance.

The walls of this chamber are formed from smooth sandstone.  Normally,

of hardening resin has been applied to every surface.

E
sand blood piles floor~
Along the floor are a few piles of ordinary red sand that looks to have

~

Series of tracks can be seen coming and going in various directions down

Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
Stretching from east to west is a long corridor hollowed out of grey
sandstone.  The floor is covered with a fine dusting of red sand and is
fairly even, despite the crudeness of the warren-like tunnels.  To the
east, you can see that the tunnel merges with several others, creating an
intersection of sorts.  Hollowed into the north and south walls of the
tunnel here, though, are two burial alcoves.

floor red sand~
The sand which covers the floor is very smooth and fine, more smooth than
almost any most granules of sand you've ever seen.  Most of the sand
appears to have been brushed off from the walls and ceiling of the
catacombs.  Soft as snow, no footprints mar the even, sandy floor.
~
E
crude warren-like tunnels~
The catacomb tunnels are extremely crude in places, as though they were
dug as an afterthought.  In several spots along the floor and ceiling, a
thick, hardening resin has been recently re-applied.  This fact is
evidenced by the walls and ceiling being more glossy in some spots. 
Chips and scratches along the edges of the catacomb expose fresh, more
colorful grey sandstone, as though they were dug recently.
~

To the east, four catacomb tunnels intersect, creating an underground
nexus.  No burial niches line the walls near the nexus, but several can
be seen beyond it to the east.

Two burial niches reside within this portion of the catacombs.  One has

Bits and pieces of leather armor rest within the burial alcove of the
crabman warrior.  All of it looks too rotten and old to be serviceable.

The battle axe entombed within the burial alcove with the crabman warrior
might have been a fine weapon at one time.  Rust has seized the axe's
head in its powerful jaws and mutilated it severely.  Termites appear to
have dined quite heavily on its handle as well.

Winding Sandstone Catacombs~
The dull grey sandstone tunnel twists around, from north to east, with a
slightly smaller and more crude catacomb branching off toward the west. 
A large crack at least an inch or so wide runs the length of the ceiling
as it follows its course from north to east.  Along the floor are
accumulations of red sand which have drifted in through the crack.  In
the east wall, scraped out of the grey sandstone rests a burial recess,
complete with a corpse.

E
crude branch 1 west~
The tunnel which branches off to the west has been constructed with
little attention to symmetry.  Both the floor and ceiling are crooked and
uneven and the walls look as though they were packed together by the
hands of children.  Even the hardening resin, which coats all the
sandstone walls down in the catacombs, appears to have been applied
haphazardly.
~
E
large crack ceiling~
Beginning along the northern part of the ceiling and sweeping to the
east, a large crack etches its way along the upper part of the catacomb. 
The edges of the crack appear smooth and worn as though it has been there
for quite some time.  A little drifting of red sand floats down through
the crack.  Evidently the crack must go all the way through to the
surface of the red sand desert.
~
E
floor red sand~
Accumulated in small piles along the floor are mounds of red sand.  Most
of the sand clearly has drifted into the catacombs via the large crack in
the ceiling.  Though there is a considerable amount of sandy detritus
along the floor, it appears unlikely that anything could be hiding in it. 
The tallest mound of sand is about four inches high.

Branching Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
While the grey sandstone catacombs virtually end here, the tunnel
branches out into two chambers.  The northern chamber is made of
sandstone the color of blood and the southern chamber has been dug out of
green sedimentary stone.  The change in color from grey to red and from
red to green is gradual and well-blended.  Dug into the western wall of
the tunnel is an alcove that has clearly been used for burial.  The
catacombs continue off to the east in a twisting fashion.

1 northern~
Up ahead to the north you can see a small, dead-end chamber.  Unlike the
catacombs around you, the chamber to the north has sandstone the color of
red wine rather than the muted grey colors of a goose's down.  At the far
back of the chamber, you can make out an elaborate burial niche.
~
E
1 southern~
The chamber to the south is unusual in that the sandstone it is composed
of is green in color and not grey.  Where the chamber adjoins the
branching tunnel here, the mixture of grey and green sand is subtle and
well-blended.  Up against the south wall of the green sandstone chamber,
you can seen the outlines of a funerary alcove.

With her skeletal arms resting peacefully on her exoskeletal chest, the
body of a female crabman lies within this burial niche.  A large,
tattered gown of lavender clings to most of her body.  The crabwoman
appears to have been dead for many years.  Below her funerary recess is
a series of geometric symbols that has been etched directly into the
sandstone.  The design consists of a triangle within a circle within a
circle within an oval.

Red Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
@RThe sediments forming the sandstone walls of this chamber are a deep
crimson color, as dark as the stains of blood that wash over a field of
battle.  Little more than eight or so feet high, the ceiling seems
uncomfortably close.  An oval niche just long enough for a human-sized
corpse has been dug into the northern wall of the chamber.  Beneath it,
scratched into the sandstone, is a series of hieroglyphics.  The burial
chamber opens into a tunnel to the south.  @n

The walls of this chamber are formed from tightly packed sand coated with
a hardening resin.  Red as blood, the sand is the same color as seen in
the red, windy desert where the crabmen have made their homes.

E
oval niche human-sized corpse northern~
A burial niche, oval in shape, has been dug into the northern wall of the
chamber.  Placed within is the five foot corpse of a crabman.  Clearly
dead for centuries, little remains of the crabman except for its
chitinous exoskeleton.  The only feature discernible about the corpse is
that there is a golden crest on its chest.

The golden crest upon the exoskeletal chest of the crabman looks to have
been a birthmark of sorts.  It is in the shape of a sun with gleaming
rays.

tunnel 1 south~
The catacombs continue to the south through a narrow tunnel.  The walls
of the tunnel are formed from grey sandstone rather than red.  The
divistion between to the two sedimentry rock types is extremely subtle.

Green Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
@GLike soft sea foam, the sandstone of this chamber has a delicate green
cast to it.  Twice as tall as a gnome and four times wider than a drunken
ogre, this chamber has a ceiling the shape of a rhombus to match the
shape of the niche dug into its south wall.  Above the niche, framed by a
smaller rhombus etched into the sandstone, is a series of hieroglyphic
characters.  On the ground, at the foot of the burial niche lies a
decaying corpse.  As the chamber merges with a tunnel to the north, the
walls lose their greenish tinge to take on a more somber, grey one.  @n

E
niche south rhombus~
The burial niche hollowed out of the south wall has the shape of a
rhombus.  Resting within, you can see the remaining fragments of a
crabman's corpse, though not much is left besides a few pieces of
exoskeleton and old, white bone.  A simple golden crest, like a tattoo or
birthmark, can still be seen on what appears to have been its chest.
~
E
foot base decaying corpse ground~
At the foot of the burial recess lies a corpse.  Judging from the acrid
smell rising off of it, the corpse has been down here for a fair amount
of time - at least three months.  The dry air has already begun to
mummify the corpse in several places along its body though most of its
major organs appear to have already decayed away or been carried off. 
From its size and stature, the body once likely belonged to a
lizardman...though where its tail went is anyone's guess.
~
E
1 north~
To the north, the walls of the catacombs lose the greenish cast they have
here and become a somber grey color.  It looks as though this chamber
were simply molded and attached to the catacombs separately, perhaps as
an afterthought.
~
E
ceiling~
While most of the chamber is roughly circular, the ceiling is not. 
The ceiling is shaped like a rhombus - matching the shape of the burial
alcove set in the southern wall.  The green sandstone walls, as they
creep up toward the ceiling, take on angles as they join up with the
rhombus.

Winding Sandstone Catacombs~
The catacombs curve and twist like the curvature of a two-humped camel's
back.  As they do so, they form simple hollows in the north and eastern
sections, which have been used as burial spaces.  The floor has been
swept clean of sand, revealing the grey sandstone floor.  To the south
and west, the catacombs continue.

simple burial spaces hollows~
Rather than being dug out of the sandstone walls after the fact, the two
funerary niches in the catacombs here appear to have been formed at the
time of the catacomb's construction.  In fact, you can still make out a
few hand prints in the walls where the hardening resin captured the
evidence of the craftsman's work.
~
E
handprints prints~
The hand prints imbedded in the sandstone walls of the chamber near and
in the burial recesses are fairly unusual.  Clearly, no human, halfling
or even ent made them.  They are twice the size of a troll's hand and
show no signs of a thumb.
~
E

The floor of the catacombs has been swept clean of sand recently.  Most
of the excess sand appears to have been removed and what was not has been
swept to the edges of the chamber, alongside the walls.

chest lies the remains of a broken short sword.  The blade is pitted with
rust and the handle cracked.  Below the eastern alcove, scratched into

consist of a circle within a rectangle within a triangle within a

Winding Sandstone Catacombs~
Swerving west to north, this tunnel twists about irregularly, seemingly
without pattern.  A few flecks of brighter sediments speckle the
otherwise grey sandstone walls.  The catacomb passage that leads north
has been swept clean of the red sand that almost uniformly dusts the
floor.  Hollowing into the east and south walls of the tunnel here are
burial niches.  Each contains a shrouded form.

The walls of the catacomb are formed from grey sand that has been packed

the glossy resin despite the obvious age of the catacombs.  Here and
there, winking at you casually, you can spot the gleam of bright metal. 
Some of the tiny metallic sediments look to be silver or mithril.

A lot of red sand covers the floor, so much that you can barely fee; the

Branching Sandstone Catacomb Tunnels~
As the grey sandstone catacombs twist about, they stop at a three-way
juncture.  There is little evidence of past traversal on the sandy, red
floor of the rough-dug caverns.  The first tunnel in the juncture leads
northward, where the catacombs curve chaotically like a sidewinder amidst
the dunes.  The other two passages branch off to the west and east
respectively.  Set into the backside of the chamber, in the south wall,
is a burial alcove.

Black Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
Immediately, the shape of this small chamber strikes you as unusual. 
Formed into a perfect square, even dwarven stone carvers would be hard
pressed to match the precise edges and angles of this black sandstone
chamber.  In the western wall of the midnight-black antechamber, a hole,
also square in shape, has been dug into the wall.  At the corners of it
are series of hieroglyphics.  The black sandstone vault opens to the east
and as it does so, the sandstone bleaches to a lifeless grey color.

Tan Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
This sandstone cul-de-sac has been dug from sedimentary rock the color of
rotting corn.  The chamber is not very large or wide but the ceiling is
extremely tall.  Within the easternmost wall of the sandstone room, a
hole the shape of a triangle has been dug into its surface.  The niche
looks large enough to hide a sizable amount of valuables or a humanoid
body.  At each of the triangle's corners, there is a series of
hieroglyphics scratched into the sandstone wall.  As the chamber merges
with a catacomb tunnel to the west, its rock composition becomes darker
and more bleak, until the sandstone is a somber grey color.

triangular hole easternmost niche~
A funerary niche has been carved into the far eastern wall of the burial
chamber.  Triangular in shape, the hollow points upward, leaving a flat
base.  Lying down within it rests the shrouded form a crabman.  From what
little you can see of the remains through the gauzy veil, the crabman was
not exactly a full crabman.  Some of his features look more human.

The only exit from this chamber lies to the west.  Made of grey
sandstone, the western passage from this chamber gradually changes in
color from light brown to a solid, dark grey as it gets further from the

Yellow Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
@YUnlike the catacomb tunnel to the north, the walls and ceiling here are
a bright, yellow color, rather than a somber grey.  The floor is covered
loosely with sand and bits of rock as well as a few white fragments of
bone.  A niche has been dug with extreme precision into the southern wall
of the chamber and looks large enough to house a corpse.  Beneath the
carefully dug trapezoidal niche is a series of hieroglyphics.  @n

1 north~
To the north, you can see the main part of the catacombs.  Unlike the
walls here, which are made of a brilliant yellow sandstone, the walls of
the northern tunnel are a muted grey color.  Where the two meet, there is
very little mixing of sediment.  It is as though this funerary chamber
were simply attached rather than dug.
~
E
floor sand~
A thin layer of sand covers the floor.  Yellow in color, the sand reminds
you of the brightly-colored hair ribbons that have often been in fashion. 
At the most, the sand is an inch deep and you can feel the hard,
sandstone ground beneath your feet.  Bits of rock and sand lie scattered
along the floor, lodged in sandy graves.
~
E
bone fragments bits rocks~
Strewn here and there in the burial chamber are a few bits of rock.  The
rocks look to be quite ordinary in so far that they are common granites,
shales, and slates.  No ores or valuable minerals appear to be in
attendance in the small orchestra of rocks.  Several bits of bone lie
near the bottom of the trapezoidal burial niche.  Dull grey with age and
decay, the bony bits look to have been part of a much larger skeleton at
one time.  Here a finger...there a rib...and over there the top of the
brain casing...the skeleton or skeletons look to have been crushed.  But
by what, you cannot fathom.
~
E
niche trapezoidal burial corpse~
Incised into the southern wall of the yellow sandstone is a burial alcove
shaped like a trapezoid.  The base of the trapezoid is much longer than
its apex by about three feet.  Ensconced within the funerary niche is the
decrepit exoskeletal remains of a crabman.  Its hands are poised on its
chest as though it were merely sleeping.

Branching Sandstone Catacomb Tunnels~
The grey sandstone tunnel slope downwards from the west a little and
levels out even more gradually as it branch to the south and north. 
Another tunnel, more crude than the other two, leads westward into a
nexus where several catacomb tunnels intersect.  There is little of
interest in this portion of the catacombs except for a single burial
alcove hollowed into the eastern wall.  Below it, a significant amount of
red sand has gathered.

A large pile of sand has been gathered at the base of the burial alcove
dug into the eastern wall.  Red in color, the gathering of sand shows
evidence of tracks.

The tracks appear to be those of some small creature.  Where they lead or
in what direction the creature might have been traveling when it crossed
over the sand, you cannot figure out.

The burial alcove carved into the eastern wall is roughly circular in
shape.  Deposited within is the form of what looks to be a crabman's
corpse.  It is difficult to ascertain, because the entire length of the
corpse, from chitinous head to curled toe, has been wrapped in
mummification bandages.  Beneath the burial niche, carved into the

Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
The floor of the catacomb here has been recently swept clean of sand and
slopes sharply downward to the east.  Luckily, the grey sandstone walls
of the catacomb are narrow enough to provide adequate guidance up and
down the slope.  A small space, much larger than the one hollowed into
the western wall, has been dug into the northern one.  The catacomb also
extends to the south.

Little more than a nook, this burial niche is quite old.  Its back
surface is heavily pitted from age and the decay of the hardening resin
coating the walls.  The body within looks to have been a middle-aged
crabman for the edges of its red chitin exoskeleton are slightly grey.  A
jagged sword, too old to be of use, sticks up out of the entombed corpse. 
Below the burial nook, etched into the grey sandstone, is a series of

Winding Sandstone Tunnel~
Like the Elhanni river, this tunnel curves and bends erratically from
west to south.  The floor slopes sharply downward to the east but levels
out as the catacomb branches south.  The grey sandstone walls of the
catacomb look to have seen better days.  They are riddled with cracks and
holes, especially the north and eastern walls, where two burial
spaces have been hollowed out of them.

floor~
The floor here is sharply sloped and has been cleared of any debris and

furtive little hands or claws, as evidenced by the marks left within the
sand.
~
E
marks claws sand~
The claw marks in the sand look to be those of a small, rat-like
creature, possibly a pack-rat.  A few claw prints lie scattered near the
eastern wall, before a tiny hole in the wall.
~
E
tiny hole~
The hole in the eastern wall is directly beneath the burial alcove. 
Something appears to be living within the hole, for you can smell old
food and a pungent musk.  The glitter of something shiny catches your eye
from within the hole, though it is much too small to search through.
~
E
grey sandstone walls cracks holes~
The walls in this part of the catacomb look fairly old and in need of
attention.  In several spots, the hardening resin which holds the tightly
packed sand together has decayed away, leaving the walls to fall apart. 
Wide cracks run down and along the walls, especially around the burial
niches dug into the north and east walls of the catacombs.
~
E
burial spaces~
Set into the north and eastern walls of the catacombs are burial alcoves. 
Both contain the exoskeletal remains of a deceased crabman.

Blue Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
@BYou cannot recall where or when you last saw sandstone this color!  The
entire chamber, whose ceiling is just ten to twelve feet tall, has been
dug from blue sandstone the color of the most valuable sapphire.  Not
only that, but the crystalline sediments in the sandstone walls are larger
than your fist.  Towards the back of the catacomb room, to the south, a
niche has been carefully and precisely dug into the wall.  The niche is
shaped like a gently curving crescent moon and is large enough to house a
body.  Around it are a series of hieroglyphics.  The blue sandstone walls
taper slightly to the north, where they lose their blue color and merge
into a catacomb tunnel whose walls are grey in color.  @n

To your astonishment and delight, some of the sediments composing the

that freezes the sand in place and gives it the texture and strength of
sandstone.

Embedded in the walls of the chamber, you can make out several large and

Low, Wide Catacomb Tunnel~
The catacombs stretch out to twice their width, compared to the northern
tunnel.  However, they are also about one-third as low, making the
quarters in here very close.  The catacombs continue to the east, where
they appear to curve around towards the south.  Set into both the west
and south walls of the tunnel are two funerary alcoves, each of which
looks occupied.

Unlike the catacomb tunnel here, the tunnel which leads in from the north
is quite narrow in comparison.  However, it is also about three times
more tall.  Anything over eight feet tall would have a lot of trouble
squeezing into the tunnels here.
~
E
1 east~
Curving with the subtlety of an ogre diplomat, the eastern catacomb twists
sharply.  Within its confines, you can see that the catacombs then
continue to the south.  Set into the walls of the chamber are yet more
burial alcoves.
~
E
alcoves funerary~
Dug with a fair amount of precision, there are two burial alcoves within
the confines of the catacomb.  One lies in the southern wall and one lies
in the western wall.  The shrouded exoskeletons of crabmen who have
definitely seen better days lies in each.

Low, Wide Catacomb Tunnel~
The ceiling of this tunnel is barely seven feet tall and would be a tight
fit for anyone taller than the average human.  However, the catacomb
tunnel is also twice as wide as those to the south.  A few tracks have
been made in the red sand that covers the floor and it looks like
something has been buried beneath a pile of sand in the corner of the
chamber.  Two alcoves used for burial have been dug into the east and
north parts of the sandstone walls.

Sandstone Catacomb - Near a Tall Statue~
Three tunnels branch off from the grey sandstone catacombs.  The first
leads north, into a low but wide section of the underground burial
chambers and the second turns to the west.  The third and final tunnel
opens into a cul-de-sac, where the sandstone gradually changes from a
medium grey to a pristine white color.  Rising to the east, like it just
stepped through the wall, stands an extremely detailed statue that
closely resembles a gargoyle.  His widespread legs form a graceful arch. 
A burial alcove has been carved beneath the arch of its legs into the
grey sandstone.

White Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
A few motes of sparkling white sand hang in the air of this bright,
almost blinding chamber.  Made of white sandstone as pure as a maiden's
virtue, the walls and floor nearly shine with their own brightness,
except in one spot.  To the south, carved into the southern wall of the
antechamber is a long but slender rectangular niche.  The niche looks
easily long enough to hold a corpse and it might still, but the shadows
within it are deceiving.  Along the bottom of the rectangular hole there
is a row of hieroglyphic symbols.  The brightness fades the further north
the chamber extends, until it disappears altogether as it links up with
the grey sandstone catacomb tunnels.

Hanging in the air like the dust twinkling down off a pixie's wing,

Sandstone Catacomb - Beneath a Cracked Ceiling~
A long, jagged crack runs through the ceiling of the grey sandstone
catacombs, stopping only at the edge of a cul-de-sac to the west.  In
fact, the crack stops at the point where the western chamber's sandstone
fades into a different color, just at its threshold.  At first the
western chamber's sandstone is a somber grey and then it slowly changes
to a bright orange sandstone.  A smaller tunnel branches off to the
south, into a darker section of the catacombs.  Set into the northern
wall is a single burial alcove.

E
long jagged crack ceiling~
A large crack runs the length of the ceiling and stops at the edge of the
western chamber of orange sandstone.  The crack is jagged, like an
artist's rendition of a lightning bolt, and several inches wide.  Coarse
and scabrous, the crack looks fairly recent.
~
E
cul-de-sac 1 west~
While made of orange sandstone, the catacomb chamber to the west contains
very little.  From here, you can see that there are no other entrances or
exits to or from it.  It is nothing more than a cul-de-sac.
~
E
small tunnel 1 south~
The catacombs continue off to the south through a tunnel which is much
more narrow than the passage here.  Unlike the catacombs here, the ones
to the south appear darker somehow.  And the smell of decay and death is
stronger.

Orange Sandstone Burial Catacomb~
This room is little more than a cul-de-sac and stands no more than twelve
feet tall and ten feet wide.  However, the chamber, with its sandstone
walls the color of a fire beetle's wing tips, extends some thirty feet
deep to the west.  A perfectly round, circular niche has been dug into
the back of the chamber and there appears to be something lying within it. 
Scattered about the sandy floor before the niche are a few miscellaneous
fragments of stone and bone.  The orange sandstone cul-de-sac opens to
the east, into a tunnel, where its color fades to a dull grey.

E
circular burial niche something~
Completely circular in shape, the funerary niche hollowed into the
western wall is very precise.  Placed within is a plank of wood and atop
that lies the corpse of a crabman.  A thin, yellow shroud veils most of
its form, but through it you can see that not much remains of the corpse
anyway.  A series of hieroglyphs has been etched into the orange
sandstone around the burial niche.
~
E
sandy floor~
A large amount of sand fills this chamber and, unlike the rest of the
catacombs, you cannot feel the hard surface of the sandstone beneath.  In
fact, you cannot be certain there is actually sandstone beneath your feet. 
Bits of rock and bone lie strewn about the surface of the floor,
half-buried in its sandy mass.
~
E
fragments stone bone~
Scattered and half-buried in the sand that covers the floor are various
pieces of chipped stone and bone.  There are maybe a handful of stone
fragments, none of which look particularly interesting.  As for the bits
of bone, you can tell very little about their origins.  Most are too
small to be identified with any part of the body.
~
E
1 east~
To the east, the catacombs open up into a series of tunnels.  And unlike
the funerary chamber here, which is comprised of orange sandstone, the
tunnels look to be formed from grey sandstone.  Where the tunnel joins up
with this chamber, the grey, somber sandstone gradually takes on a more
lively orange color.

Musty Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
Carved into the south and east walls of this chamber are funerary
hollows, both of which appear to be occupied.  The northern tunnel
diverges to the west into a chamber cluttered with rocky debris.  A
shrouded form, perhaps a corpse, has been kicked to the side of the
tunnel.  Flecks of red chitin lie scattered about the sandy floor.

funerary hollows~
Two burial hollows can be found dug into the sandstone walls of the

E
shrouded form corpse~
All dressed up and no place to go, a crabman corpse, still wearing its
burial shroud, lies on the ground.  It appears that the body has been
desecrated and any possessions it might have had have been removed from
its shrouded form.  In places, the corpse's exoskeleton has been cracked
open and peeled back.  Flecks of its red exoskeleton lie scattered around
the chamber.

The catacomb chamber to the west resembles this one mostly, save for the

The corpse lying within the burial recess must have been quite large in
life.  Probably little more than a year dead, the skin covering her legs
and arms has been completely mummified.  A pair of wire-thin mithril
armbands set with sunstones still cling to the crabwoman's arms. 
Squeezed between the ground and the bottom of the funerary recess is a
stretch of sandstone that bears a series of designs.  Geometric in
origin, the designs consist of a square within a circle within an oval
within a circle.

Sandstone Catacomb Chamber~
The only exit out of this grey sandstone chamber lies to the east, where
a tunnel twists back to the north.  Two funerary alcoves have been
hollowed into the walls.  One is in the west wall and one is in the north
wall.  At the edge of the southern wall, where you might expect to see
another burial niche, you see nothing but an usual outcropping of
sandstone that juts at a forward slant.  Bits of rocky debris clutters
the ground.

E
bits rocky debris ground~
Here and there, bits of debris lie scattered along the floor.  Mostly
rock and a little bone, the detritus ranges in size from a pebble-sized
chunk of rock to a femur bone.  For the most part, the debris is evenly
distributed, except for a small stack of it in the center of the chamber.
~
E
small stack center~
The stack of debris in the center of the chamber is composed only of
bones.
~
E
femur bones~
The bones present within the stack appear to be the remains of some
canine.  Heaped together in a pile, it looks as though the bones have
been carefully, even artistically stacked in a playful arrangement.
~
E
forward slant outcropping sandstone southern~
Sticking up out of the wall, there is an outcropping of rock.  The rock
is angled in such a way as to make it difficult to see what is under its
jutting surface.
~
E
under mechanism~
As you look closer at the jutting rock, you can see a complex mechanism
built into the side of the wall.  For the most part, the mechanism has
been built from cogs, gears, and twine, though there is the odd metal pin
sticking up here and there.  The angled rock concealing it serves the
task of keeping its intricacies free from sand and grit.  Just below the
mechanism you spy a corroded brass crank.
~
E
funerary alcoves~
Two funerary hollows occupy this dead-end tunnel.  One is set into the
western wall and one has been set in the northern wall.  Strangely, the
south wall is bare.
~
E
1 south~
The south wall of the catacombs is like any other.  It is made of tightly
packed grey sand that has been coated with a hardening resin.  With the
resin glazed over its surface, the sand takes on all the characteristics
of sandstone.  From ceiling to floor, unusually straight cracks run
vertically down the wall, parallel to one another.
~
E
straight cracks parallel seams~
The unusually straight cracks are spaced about twelve feet apart.  They
could easily just be cracks...or they could be seams.
~
E
corroded brass crank~
Sticking about three inches out of the south wall, below the jutting
outcrop of sandstone, you find a small crank.  Forged from brass, the
crank has a triangular handle.  Both the shaft and handle of the crank
are coated in a thick, green corrosion.
~
E
maul head~
Once a very large weapon, all that remains of the maul is its head.  Its
handle is nowhere in sight.  Incomplete as it is, the maul's head is
worthless.

Still dressed in a robe made up to look wealthy, a fairly thin, almost

foot long and half a foot wide.  While at one time the chest might have
contained a collection of the crabman's valuables, it has long since been
raided.  Its lid has been pried open.  Just below the chest, at the base
of the recess, a series of geometric designs have been etched into the
sandstone wall.  The design consists of an oval within a rhombus within a

Quartz Sandstone Catacombs~
This section of the catacombs looks far different than those which lie to
the north.  They have been dug through white, and not grey, sandstone and
the passages appear much older and cruder.  Tunneled out like a passage
in an anthill, this swerving corridor extends from east to west.  Along
the northern wall there is a single protrusion, just to one side of a
slab of grey sandstone.  In the catacomb wall to the south, a large
recess, big enough to house a corpse or two, has been dug.

1 northern protrusion~
The sandstone protrusion in the northern wall looks to have been molded
by hand.  It is shaped like a down-turned crescent.  Its unusual shape
hides both from the elements and from casual view a mechanism concealed
below it.
~
E
mechanism~
Below the outcropping of rock is an unusually complex mechanism.  So far,
you have seen little sign of any technology of this kind.  Made of glass
gears, cogs, and metal pins, the mechanism looks to center around a small
brass crank.
~
E
brass crank~
The brass crank jutting from the center of the mechanism has a triangular
handle and looks worn from use.  It also looks to have been recently
polished as there is little tarnish on the surface of the worn brass
device.
~
E
slab grey sandstone~
Set into the northern wall of the pale white passageway is a block of
grey sandstone.  Like a door, you can see parallel vertical cracks on
each side of the block and it looks to somehow rise into the ceiling.  A
dusting of quartz sandstone sediment, ground from the rising effort,
lends truth to this testimony.

Quartz Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
The sandstone passage here sweeps in a abrupt curve from east to south,
almost as if its maker had a sudden change of mind as to what direction
to continue in.  Loose grains of sand and quartz sediments cover the
ground and a fine detrital dust filters into the tunnel from a slim crack
in the ceiling.  Two nooks have been hollowed into the walls of the
passage here.  The recess in the western wall looks more recently dug
than its northern counterpart though.

In the ceiling of the chamber, there is a small crack.  No longer than

Quartz Sandstone Catacombs - Dead End~
This rough, catacomb tunnel dead ends here but continues back towards the
north.  The passage has been dug through sandstone, which is mainly
comprised of white quartz and sand sediments.  Two burial alcoves have
been dug into this portion of the catacombs; one lies in the western wall
and one in the southern.  A slab of purple rock, smoothly polished, is
set into the eastern wall of the catacomb tunnel.

slab purple rock 1 eastern~
At first glance, the slab of purple stone set into the eastern wall of
the tunnel looks to be little more than crude rock.  But on closer
inspection, it turns out to be a single, nearly flawless piece of
amethyst.  Eight feet wide and twelve feet tall, the amethyst slab has no
seams or cracks where it merges with the quartz sandstone walls.  The two
appear to be a part of one another.  The surface of the amethyst slab is
covered with a host of geometric figures inscribed within one another.  A
few fingerprints lie upon the slab, made in the dust upon its surface.

The small form of a young crabman lies within the burial niche.  Probably
no older than a human child of ten when it died, the crabman's arms are
placed across its chest in a restful pose.  Clutched in the young
crabman's hands is a small wooden chest.  The chest is painted with a
myriad of bright colors.  Etched into the sandstone below the burial
niche is a series of symbols.  Geometric in nature, the symbols consist
of a circle within a circle within a square within a rhombus.

Still dressed in an expensive-looking cotton robe that speaks of wealth,
a fairly thin, almost emaciated crabman has been stuffed within this
funerary alcove.  Shoved in beside the gaunt and decaying corpse is a
large steel chest.  While at one time the chest might have contained an
allotment of the crabman's valuables, it has long since been raided.  Its
lid has been ripped completely off.  Cut into the sandstone directly
below the alcove is a grouping of concentric symbols.  The symbols
consist of a rhombus within a square within a triangle superimposed on a
crescent within an oval.

E
semi-circular archway amethyst~
Carved from a single, flawless amethyst, a violet archway has been set
into the western wall.  The clarity of the amethyst is exquisite and its
color matches the sandstone within the room perfectly.  A series of
eleven geometric figures inscribed within one another have been etched
into the surface of the archway.
~
E
top sand~
The top of the sarcophagus is covered loosely with dust and sand.  It
appears that it, and its contents, have rested undisturbed within this
chamber for quite some time.
~
E
5 sandstone walls~
The walls of this chamber, on first glance, look to be comprised of
violet sandstone.  But in reality, tightly packed blue and red sand have
been lumped together more evenly than you might have thought possible and
coated with a hardening resin to turn the sand into sandstone.  You can
barely distinguish the difference in color from grain to grain.
~
E
geometric eleven gemometric figures surface~
A string of eleven geometric symbols adorns the surface of the amethyst
archway.  The symbols are mostly illegible, but look to be geometric. 
They are lined up in a row, just like an epitaph or a name marker.

Quartz Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
Dug through solid white quartz sandstone, it must have taken quite some
time to create these catacombs.  While not what one might call close to
being level or exact, they seem to have a definitely purpose or plan. 
The catacomb here curves around from the west to the south.  Set into the
north and east walls are recesses.  Each appears to contain the shadowy
form of a body.

Each containing the remains of some unfortunately crabman, two burial
alcoves occupy this part of the catacombs.  One recess resides in the
northern wall and one resides in the eastern wall.

The passage which curves west is formed from the sparkling white quartz
sandstone as the catacombs here.  The tunnel west continues for some
fifty feet before turning south.
~

1 south~
To the south, you can see that the catacomb comes to a dead end after
about seventy feet.  You can see something unusual about the wall at the
end of the passage.

Short but slender, the corpse lying within this burial recess looks to
have been a dexterous fighter of some sort.  His exoskeleton shows many
scratches, scrapes, and dents and lying beside his body are the broken
remains of a jagged harpoon.  Beneath the tip of the harpoon, etched into
the sandstone, is a series of geometric symbols.  The symbols show a

Tall and burly, the corpse lying within the burial niche is missing both
of her legs.  Her exoskeleton is marred heavily and her remaining bones
show the signs of many healed injuries.  Resting on the crabman's chest
lies the remains of a broken rapier.  The blade is pitted with rust and
the handle cracked.  Etched into the sandstone below the burial niche is
a series of symbols.  Geometric in nature, the symbols consist of a

Quartz Sandstone Catacomb Tunnel~
This tunnel curves and twists but keeps to a general north-south
direction.  Dug through white quartz sandstone, the walls have a slight
gleam to them, like the sands of a white desert.  Set into the west and
east sides of the catacomb are burial alcoves, neither of which looks
vacant.

sandstone walls gleam~
The walls of the catacombs have been dug from quartz sandstone.  Or at
least they look like it, on the surface.  In actuality, the walls are
formed from tightly packed grains of quartzite sand and have been covered
with a hardening resin, so that they retain the shape and strength of
sandstone.

E
burial alcoves~
Two burial alcoves reside within this chamber.  One has been dug into the
quartz sandstone wall to the west and one in the eastern wall.  Both
appear to of the same approximate age.

Resting peacefully within the burial alcove is the corpse of a crabman
resplendent in a regal robe.  Stitched into the crabman's golden robe are
images of leaping cats, blue candles, and green ansate crosses.  A broken
hammer rests beside the crabman's corpse beneath its left, clawed hand. 
Cut into the sandstone directly below the alcove is a grouping of
concentric symbols.  The symbols consist of a rectangle within a circle
within a square within a trapezoid.

Quartz Sandstone Catacombs - Dead End~
This catacomb tunnel dead ends here but continues back towards the north. 
Like a rabbit's warren, the quartz sandstone has been burrowed through
and dug with little mind to straight lines or precision.  In the eastern
and southern walls of the catacombs there are burial recesses large
enough for a humanoid body.  A slab of opaque white rock has been placed
in the western wall of the passage.

A slab of white, opaque rock has been set into the west wall.  To either

Still wearing a worn brown outfit, overly sized to fit its large
exoskeleton, the body of a crabman rests within a funerary alcove.  Tan
sand clings to the outfit, blending almost perfectly with it.  Tucked
under one of the crabman's arms is what looks to be the corpse of a small
feline.  Etched into the sandstone below the burial niche is a series of
symbols.  Geometric in nature, the symbols consist of a circle within a

The corpse lying within the burial recess must have been quite large in
life.  Probably little more than a year dead, folds of mummified skin
hang from the exoskeleton of the female crabman like the throat of a
pelican.  Several wire-thin electrum bracelets cling to the crabwoman's
decaying legs.  Cut into the sandstone directly below the alcove is a
grouping of concentric symbols.  The symbols consist of a rectangle

A Nacreous Sandstone Catacomb~
Like the inside of an oyster's shell, the sandstone walls of this large
chamber shimmer like the surface of a pearl.  Though the walls and floor
have been hollowed out and leveled with an exactness very few could
match, there are digging marks along the eastern wall.  The marks run all
along the edges of an opaque, white, semi-circular archway that gleams
with the same pearly color as the walls themselves.  In the center of the
room is a stone sarcophagus covered with dust and sand.

Covering its surface are series of geometric figures inscribed within one

Beneath the Burial Catacomb of the All-Father~
The pale limestone and depth of this chamber places it at a much older
age than the catacombs above.  Rectangular in shape, a large,
heavily-altered cavern stretches before you and continues to the north. 
The walls and floor of the cavern have been smoothed and polished,
leaving the ceiling as the only remaining clue that this chamber is in fact
a cavern.  A steep but sturdy stone ramp ascends through an angular shaft
in the ceiling.  Towards the northern part of the chamber there is a
curtain of folded limestone, formed from deposited drip sediments, that
descends from the ceiling until it merges gently with the ground.

E
walls floor~
The walls and floor of this chamber are made of limestone and other
recalcitrated rocks.  The cavern appears to be unaltered, save for the
hole in the ceiling to which the stone ramp leads.  Smoothed by time and
water, which no longer looks to be in residence within the chamber, the
floor has a slightly rippled look to it.
~
E
steep stone ramp~
A stone ramp cut from a single piece of pale green limestone leads upward
through a shaft in the ceiling.  The bottom and sides of the limestone
ramp have been polished to a gleam while the top of the ramp has been
left rough, to provide traction up the ramp.
~
E
1 northern curtain folded limestone dripstone~
Dissolved by water and re-deposited in an ever thickening drapery of
rock, limestone sediments shroud the entrance to a chamber to the north. 
Almost hiding it from view, the silvery chamber past the dripstone
curtain looks to be made of nothing you have ever seen before.

Behind a Dripstone Curtain~
Unlike the chamber to the south which was once clearly a cavern, this
room is like nothing you have ever seen before.  It has but one wall that
circles around gently and the ceiling is perfectly flat circle.  Both
gleam with the shine of polished silver.  The floor of this chamber is
tiled from a mosaic of marble fragments and is smoother than glass.  At
the center of the chamber is a dais with a golden sarcophagus upon it.  A
beam of light, entering in from a shaft in the ceiling far above
illuminates the rectangular coffin.  Towards the south you can see the
folds of a dripstone curtain.

1 south dripstone curtain~
To the south, past a crack in the silvery walls, you can see the edges of
a dripstone curtain.  Dissolved by water and re-deposited in an ever
thickening drapery of rock, limestone sediments shroud the entrance to
this chamber, almost hiding it from view.
~
E
ceiling shaft~
The shaft in the ceiling is some fifty feet about your head.  Square in
shape, the passage through which the beam of light descends has precisely
cut edges and angles that the most talented dwarves would be hard-pressed
to match, let alone better.  You cannot see the top of the shaft from
here and its sides look too sleek and slippery to climb.
~
E
silver walls~
The entire chamber, except for the floor, is covered in a thick, silvery
substance too shiny to be to silver and much too smooth to be any ore you
have ever heard of.  As a beam of light enters the chamber and focuses on
the golden sarcophagus resting upon the dais, the walls practically
shimmer.
~
E
floor tiled mosaic glass~
Unlike the walls of the chamber which are circular and made of a
substance more silvery than silver, the floor consists of a mosaic of
marble fragments.  The mosaic is an extremely exquisite piece of artwork
and if you could somehow carry it with you, you'd be rich.  The collage
of colorful marble bits depicts an unusual scene of the great pyramid
which stands within the Naraki Desert.  The mosaic, however, depicts no
sand around the pyramid, instead picturing trees, flowers, woodland
animals and other lush plants.  The giant monument at the center of the
mosaic looks very unusual.
~
E
giant monument center pyramid great~
At first, it is hard to place what is so unusual about the pyramid at the
center of the mosaic floor.  But then it strikes you that the pyramid
looks much taller than it does from the vantage of the desert.  Not only
that, but there are ancillary buildings surrounding the pyramid,
including several obelisks and smaller stone mastabas.  The most unusual
feature about the pyramid is its tip.
~
E
tip~
The mosaic of the great pyramid, surrounded by forest and stone
buildings, is nothing like what lies in the desert.  But the most
startling thing the mosaic depicts concerns the pyramid's tip.  Shooting
out from the pyramid's apex is a brilliant beam of blue energy that
angles down from the pyramid to an archway of stone that stands by itself
somewhere to the southeast of the pyramid's southeast corner.  The
archway glows with a blue nimbus.
~
E
dais~
The dais which rises in the center of the silvery chamber has three tiers. 
Atop the final tier rests a long sarcophagus fashioned from a golden
sandstone the color of a pharaoh butterfly's wings.  A beam of light
shines directly down upon the center of the dais, bathing it and the
sarcophagus with a brilliant gleam.

Beneath a Spiraling Tower of Sand~
Dug directly below the tower, this chamber is roughly rectangular in
shape.  The walls, ceiling, and floor are all comprised of somber grey
sandstone that has the look of being burrowed or tunneled through.  A
stone ladder, supported by cut blocks of red sandstone, leads upward
through a hole in the ceiling to the base of the tower.  To the south,
the chamber extends into a network of tunnels.
~
*Connects to crabman library*
[Merior] does the artificial nature of the sandstone have some significance?
*If you really must know, there isnt any building stone around here so
the crabmen have learned to take sand, mold it into the correct shape,
and then pee on it :P (no joke, its very subtle though) Since you can
skin the crabmen above and the living ones below and get a bladder full
of liquid resin, i figured it was explained ;)

walls ceiling floor~
The walls, ceiling and floor of the chamber look to be made of sandstone. 
However, a thick hardening resin coats each of them.  It looks like this
chamber, and the rest of them, are artificial constructions.  A stone

~
E
blocks red sandstone~
Blocks of red sandstone have been stacked under the grey sandstone ramp
that ascends through a hole in the ceiling.  Formed from packed sand and
then coated with a thick, hardening resin, only the sandstone's slightly
glossy appearance gives it away as artificial sandstone.

A stone ladder runs from the floor to the ceiling, leading up to a hole. 
Rectangular in shape and about four feet wide, the hole appears to be
