Before the Black Void~
Down about six feet in the hole, you notice that dirt walls surround you
on every side.  Large wooden roots from the surrounding trees planted in
the area weave around in the dirt wall making random turns every few
inches.  Most of the dirt is dark brown in color, but on the north wall
there is a black hole that seems to warp any molecules that come near it. 
Fresh footprints in the dirt floor indicate that this hole has recently
seen visitors.

In the Void~
You find yourself floating in blackness.  There is not anything
supporting your feet nor anything holding you up.  It seems as if you are
suspended by invisible strings extending from the mysterious, colorless
expanse.  An eerie light appears to come from nowhere allowing you to see
only yourself hovering in the void.  Out in the emptiness a steady
low-pitched hum can be heard.

Before the Black Void~
Down about six feet in the hole, you notice that dirt walls surround you
on every side.  Large wooden roots from the surrounding trees planted in
the area weave around in the dirt wall making random turns every few
inches.  Most of the dirt is dark brown in color, but on the north wall
there is a black hole that seems to warp any molecules that come near it. 
Fresh footprints in the dirt floor indicate that this hole has recently
seen visitors.

Before the Black Void~
Down about six feet in the hole, you notice that dirt walls surround you
on every side.  Large wooden roots from the surrounding trees planted in
the area weave around in the dirt wall making random turns every few
inches.  Most of the dirt is dark brown in color, but on the north wall
there is a black hole that seems to warp any molecules that come near it. 
Fresh footprints in the dirt floor indicate that this hole has recently
seen visitors.

The Path of Destiny - The Beginning~
Surrounding you on three sides are some very thick, dark green bushes
that stand about seven feet tall.  The soil under the shrubs is moist and
rich; bits of healthy roots arch above the ground and resturn to their
earthy abode.  It is impossible to move through the hedge; you can only
follow the path to the north.

The Path of Destiny - First Challenge~
A hard-packed dirt path runs north and south here between walls of bushes. 
On the west wall, the bushes appear to be the type that produce
delectable berries, but they have been picked clean of any nourishment. 
To the north, two finely-crafted stone pillars reach up to the sky
marking the north exit.

The Path of Destiny - Second Challenge~
Very tall bushes line the eastern and western sides of the path, their
branches thinning towards the north.  In between the thinning bushes are
small lion statues that gradually increase in size from the south to the
north.  Furthest north are a pair opposing statues of lions.  Each is
twenty feet tall and depicts a lion in a ferocious-looking roar.
~
[Fenlyn] Also can be used for customs to be put in at a later date.  If
custom, then can lower reset to something better.  Or reagent for something.
[Fenlyn] Decided to create a custom.  Scarred leather belt in theatre and lion's mane = furred belt.

The Path of Destiny - Third Challenge~
Healthy, dark soil makes up this part of the path.  The soil is so rich
and loose that each step you take creates footprints about an inch deep. 
Along the side of the path are hardened walls of dirt that reach about
ten feet into the air.  The path to the north leads to a pair of hardened
dirt pillars capped with steel plating at the very top.  At the base of
the western pillar is a shiny metallic panel with protruding buttons.

The Path of Destiny - Final Challenge~
A translucent field of blue light separates this part of the path from
the room to the north.  Occasionally a burst of electrical energy sparks
through the blue field indicating that it is a barrier of some kind.  The
firm ground is made up of a very fine red dirt that resembles clay in
color but beach sand in texture.  Just before the barrier to the north, a
small panel with many colored parts stands alone.
~
[Fenlyn] each color points to an rflag.  If that rflag is false ( made
false on entering), then only that button will raise the barrier.

A singular beam of light shines down on the end of the path you have
traveled.  Several trees prevent any further travel along the path; their
branches are tightly interwoven into a mess of wood and leaves.  In the
center of the room lies a simple wooden chest.
