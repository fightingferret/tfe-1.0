Before The Barrier Reef~
To the east looms a vast coral reef.  As hard as stone and twice as
beautiful, the reef is a bright orange-red, the color of the setting sun. 
Dotted here and there with anemones, sea cucumbers and various starfish,
the reef teems with life.  A wide archway opens to the east, too
symmetrical to be natural.

Within a Coral Archway~
Standing within the archway, you notice the coral is finely polished and
the pores have been filled in with a fine, silvery metal giving the coral
a mottled look.  The floor of the archway is smooth, burnished coral,
sprinkled liberally with sand.  To the east and south lie coral hallways,
glowing with a faint light.

Within the Kelp Beds~
The green kelp stalks rise, tall and straight, to the surface where the
broad leaves spread out over the water.  Planted in rows and carefully
tended, the kelp opens to allow small trails between the huge marine
plants.  Many varieties of colorful seaweed grow in a border along the
trails, lending some color to the dark green of the kelp beds.

Within the Kelp Beds - Along a Small Trail~
The carefully tended sandy trail winds around and through the vast kelp
beds.  The greenish-brown of the kelp makes the clear water seem murky,
though the bright beds of seaweed bordering the kelp help to lighten the
gloom.  Occasional schools of fish flit past you on the way to the
plankton grounds.

The kelp stalks in the beds to the east have been harvested recently.  A
number of small seedlings have been planted to replace the harvested
stalks.  Bordering beds of colorful seaweed provide some relief from the
constant greenish-brown color of the kelp.  Flickers of movement from
within the kelpbeds to the north catch your eye, though you never see any
more than flashes of color.

Small, round rocks are scattered along the sandy trail, worn smooth by
the ever-changing currents.  The stalks of kelp are very close together

Along the Sea Floor~
Green seaweed waves gently in the current.  Sea cucumbers grow in a
variety of colors, though the plants are uncommonly small.  Brown sand
mixes with powdery white sand in a salt and pepper mix on the rocky
ground.  The brown sand is prevalent to the west and fades to white
eastward.

Along the Sea Floor~
Sloping downward into the deeper sea, the sand here is littered with sharp
stones and gravel.  The seaweed is a murky brown and most of it lies in
dead tangles around the few living strands still clinging to the rocky
floor.  A few stunted sea cucumbers, which are an unhealthy brown, grow
among the rocks.

seaweed~
Decaying and limp, the seaweed is an ugly brown color.  The few live
strands are being choked out by the accumulation of dead plants.

cucumbers~
Stunted and brown, the sea cucumbers are withered and dying.

Along the Sea Floor - Before an Underwater Cavern~
The sea floor here is covered with brownish sand and gravel, and shards
of sharp stone litter the ground.  Murky seaweed chokes out the few other
plants trying to grow here.  In the shadow of a large rock formation to
north, the marine life is sparse here.
