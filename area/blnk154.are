Before the Gates of Shadybrook~
Rising up before you to the south are the massive stone gates of the
halfling city of Shadybrook.  Etched into each of the gates is the image
of a delicate white rose on a blood-red shield.  On each side of the
gates a stone watchtower has been erected and from within it you can see
several halflings peering over over the horizon.  Spanning out around you
to the northeast and northwest are the vast rolling hills of the
Shadybrook wilds which go on for miles with no end in sight.  To the
north the worn, wagon-rutted Southern Trade Road journeys off over the
rolling hills of the wilds.

Inside the North Gates of Shadybrook~
Directly to the north of you are the massive stone gates leading out of
the city of Shadybrook.  Deep ruts have been carved into the ground
around the gates, testament to the many years they have opened and closed
to allow travellers in.  Set into the right side of the wall next to
gates is a large steel @Wlever@n covered in grime.  Built up on each side
of the gates to the east and west are small stone guardhouses with
watchtowers built on top of their roofs.  To the south the city of
Shadybrook begins to unfold before you.

Intersection of North Main Street and North Jezebel Avenue~
Spanning out before you to the south, southwest and southeast is the vast
city of Shadybrook.  Large and small white stone houses alike dot the
grassy landscape of the city.  The roads are covered in deep wagon ruts
which cut through the low grass.  The land rises and falls due to the
builders taking no time to flatten the landscape, leaving it as it was
several years ago.  Jezebel Avenue lies to the east and west of this
point, making its lap around the exterior ring of the city.  To the south
North Main Street plunges deep into the heart of the city.

North Main Street~
The street here is covered with deep wagon ruts that have filled with
water from past rains, leaving puddles of mud everywhere.  Sitting just
off the street to the east and west are small stone houses with wide
gravel walkways leading up to them.  Around the foundations of each house
are small white lilies and red rose bushes.  To the south North Main
Street continues its course into the heart of the city towards a small
hill.  To the north the street makes its way towards the northern gates
of the city.

Sunnydale Park - North End~
Small oak trees dot the grassy hilltop of the park.  Tucked in between
the trees are small stone benches; each covered in leaves.  Scanning the
area around you, you note that you are directly in the center of town and
the dozens of residental buildings and shops span out in every direction
around you.  To the north the hill slopes down on a thirty degree angle
as it heads back down into the business district of the town.  To the
east and west the park continues along the gently sloping hill.  Directly
to the south a large crystal fountain rises up from the center of the
park.

Before a Magnificent Crystal Fountain~
Positioned in the center of the park here is a massive fountain made
entirely from a bluish-hued crystal.  The fountain has been carved into
the shape of the goddess Freylia kneeling before a fallen halfling
bedecked in battle-armor.  Around the base of the fountain are several
small white rose bushes.  Nearly obscured by the thick vines of the roses
is a small silver @Wplaque@n upon which something has been engraved. 
Surrounding the fountain in all directions are pearly-white marble
benches.  The park spans out in all directions along the slopes of the
hill.

This massive fountain has been carved from a bluish-hued crystal which
twinkles in the light.  The fountain has been shaped in the likeness of
the goddess Freylia kneeling before a fallen halfling warrior with her
arms cradling his small head.  Freylia herself is bedecked in battle
armor and strapped to her back is a massive two-handed sword.
~
E
white rose bushes~
Planted around the base of the fountain are several healthy rose bushes
which bear ivory-white roses.  Each of the roses is in full bloom and
their delicate petals have droplets of dew scattered across them.  Thick
vines from the bushes tangle with each other and continue around the
fountain where they nearly obscure a small plaque.

Sunnydale Park - West End~
Hundreds of walnuts lie scattered about the park, most of which have been
robbed of their meat leaving only their tops while a few have remain
unscathed.  The lush, green grass has been cut down to the height of
about three inches, making this a lovely picnic area.  The branches of a
large walnut tree which lies off the north hang just a few feet overhead,
blocking out the view of the sky and providing a cool shade.  To the east
the sound of a bubbling fountain can be clearly heard.  To the north,
east, and south the park continues while to the west the hill slopes
downwards and heads onto a small street.

Sunnydale Park - East End~
Like a soft velvet blanket stretched over a bed, the thick, green grass
of the park covers every inch of the hill, only interrupted by the
occasional patch of wildflowers or tree.  To the northeast, southeast and
east you are given a clear view of the city from its small stone cottages
and buildings to its massive walls which surround it.  Directly to the
west a large crystal fountain has positioned in the center of the park
and the sound of its bubbling water drifts through the air.  To the east
the hill slopes down and onto a small street.

Large patches of wildflowers cover almost every inch of the park in this

and southwest is the vast green landscape of the city, occasionally
interrupted by white stone buildings.  Directly to the east a large maple
tree stands at an angle on the side of the hill.  To the north a fountain
made of crystal has been erected in the center of the park.  Below the
hill to the south a street begins its southern journey through the city.

Sunnydale Park - Southeast Corner~
Dominating this corner of the park is a gigantic maple tree, several
decades old, which hangs on an angle on the edge of the hill.  Its thick,
dark brown trunk is the size of four halflings after a good meal.  Its
delicate branches are covered in bright green leaves which occasionally
fall to the ground when the wind blows.  Resting beneath the shade of the
tree next to its trunk is a small bench.  Young wildflowers have begun to
sprout up from beneath the lush green grass, adding a touch of color to
the landscape.  The park continues onward to the north and west.

The remains of a small cobblestone wall sits hanging on the edge of the
hill to the south and west.  Glittering across the length of the wall are
the tiny silken threads from a spider; each glistening in the light. 
Placed diagnoally to the southwest is a small marble bench which carvings
of halflings at play etched across its surface.  The park continues to

the elements for so many years.

Like a piece of artwork an intricate design made from silken threads has

This small bench is about three feet long and two feet wide.  A single

The view of the surrounding city is marvelous from this vantage point;
every small building as well as tree and road can be clearly seen. 
Towering to the northwest on the edge of the hill is a large walnut tree
with large, leaf-filled branches which span overhead, providing a cooling
shade.  Placed in a small dip a few feet from the tree is a small marble
bench polished to a high gloss.  To the southeast a fountain rises up in
the center of the park.  To the east and south the park continues across
the grassy hill.

Sunnydale Park - Northeast Corner~
A lone oak tree stands on this portion of the park.  Aged and gnarled it
looks as though at any moment it could collapse beneath its own weight. 
Erected on the northeast edge of the hill here is the statue of a
beautiful halfling woman bedecked in battle-armor and grasping a large
spiked mace.  At the base of the statue is a small bronze plaque nearly
obscured by the thick grass which grows around it.  A few feet to the
southwest of the statue a small bench has been placed.  The park spreads
out the south and west from this point.

North Main Street~
Most of the grass along this strip of the street has been ripped away by
the many feet that tread down this road everyday.  In place of the grass
are large mud puddles which span almost the entire width of the road. 
Standing just off the street to the west is a large white marble building. 
Great stone pillars line the front of the building and support its
massive domed ceiling.  Directly to the east an open archway leads into a
small, brightly-lit stone building.  To the south the street climbs up a
sloping hill onto Sunnydale Park.  To the north the street continues its
course through the city.

Baker's Way~
The various smells from the surrounding bakeries and shops fill the air
along the road.  To the north and south large white marble buildings sit
off the edge of the road and occasionally a strong wave of heat emanates
from within them.  To the west Baker's Way continues its course through
the food district of Shadybrook.  Off in the distance to the east you
spot a small, grassy hill rising up in the center of town.

Lilac's Tart Shop~
The overwhelming aroma of freshly baked tarts fills the air of this large
shop.  Lining the eastern and western walls are glass cases within which
are several sheets of freshly baked tarts which still steam.  Upon the
northern wall is a long marble counter on which sheets of uncooked tarts
rest.  Behind the counter are several large brick ovens which
occasionally throw an intense wave of heat off.  To the south a simple
wooden archway offers the only exit out of the shop.

Dominating this small shop are several massive brick ovens which have
been place against the north, east, and western walls.  Tucked inbetween
the ovens is a long wooden table on which several loaves of freshly baked
bread rest; each covered by a glass top.  Hanging from the edge of the
table is a small wooden @Wsign@n with pictures of various types of bread
upon its face.  Every so often the sound of the flames within the ovens
flaring can be heard followed by a wave of intense heat filling the room. 
To the north a wide doorway leads back out onto Baker's Way.

Baker's Way~
Standing just off the road to the north and south are two large marble
buildings with thick, thatched roofs.  Small alleyways run past each of
the buildings in which you can see several large crates and sacks stacked
up next to them.  The sound of roaring flames can be clearly heard from
within each of the structures and the distinct aroma of chocolate, sugar
and vanilla wafts out from within them.  The grassy road continues to the
east and west from here, continuing past the many bakeries of the town.

Off in the back of the shop, set against the southern wall, is a long

Small walls composed of blocks of white marble line the edges of Baker's
Way here.  Wagon ruts can be clearly seen imprinted into the soft, grassy
ground.  Dotting the road are several small white lilies which have
avoided being crushed by the traffic this road has seen.  To the east a
small hill rises up from the center of town on which you can see several
white benches surrounding a large crystal fountain.  To the west Baker's
Way continues as it runs in between several buildings lining its edges.

Large wagons filled to their tops with large crates, sacks, and barrels

from the road from several years of feet constantly walking upon it and
the many wagons which come through the town.  To the north stands a large
building with a low archway from which the scent of cheese emanates.  A
small building topped with four small chimneys, each spewing forth
billowing clouds of black smoke, stands directly to your south.  Baker's
Way continues to the east and west from this point as it continues its
course through the town.

Intersection of West Jezebel Avenue and Baker's Way~
Two roads intersect at this point in town, West Jezebel Avenue and
Baker's Way.  Most of the grass which covers the intersection has been
crushed beneath the weight of wagons and the many feet of travellers
passing over this point but on each corner of the roads it grows thick
and tall.  Looming like a watchful guardian directly to the west are the
western gates of the city.  Atop each side of the gates are small stone
watchtowers in which you can just barely make out the movement of guards. 
West Jezebel Avenue runs to the north and south, and Baker's Way heads
east.

Looming before you to the west, like a watchful guardian, are the massive
western gates of the city.  Stone watchtowers flying the battle standards
of the Shadybrook Militia rest atop each side of the gates.  Running away
from the gates to the north and south are the battlements which surround
the city.  Set into the side of the gates is a steel @Wlever@n covered in
flakes of red rust.  To the north and south small stone guard houses
stand; each void of any windows and set with a single steel door which

Long wooden shelves line the walls of this small shop, each covered in

up the cooling process but still leaves the shop uncomfortable.  Set
against the southern wall are four massive ovens.  Ripples of heat can be
seen in front of each of the ovens and blasts of intense heat constantly
issue forth from them.  In the center of the room a long wooden table has
been setup on which several pies, each a different flavor, rest under a

South Main Street~
Towering up before you to the east and west are massive two-story stone
buildings with thick, thatched roofs.  Rich, brown maple support beams
have been worked into the corners of the buildings and the stones set in
between them.  Several windows adorn the faces of the walls and peering
inside you can see several halflings gathered at the tables inside. 
Engraved bronze @Ysigns@n hang over the doors of each dwelling upon which
you can see bold writing.  Off in the distance to the south the massive
southern gates of the city can be seen.  South Main Street continues to
the north and south from this point as it continues through the town.

Towering up to the east and west of you are two impressive buildings. 
Each is almost identical to the other; each is composed of white stone,
maple support beams and a thatched roof.  Set into the eastern building
is a large maple door over which a engraved bronze sign hangs.  The
western building has an oak door as well as a bronze sign hanging over it. 
Small windows adorn the face of the buildings and through the eastern one
you can see several halflings gathered round tables while the western
building only gives a view of a decorated sitting room.

Intersection of South Main Street and South Jezebel Avenue~
The southern edge of Shadybrook lies just to your south.  South Main
Street halts its southward course at this point, barred by the southern
gates which lie directly to the south.  South Jezebel Avenue runs
east-west from here as it works its way along the outer walls of the city. 
Spanning out to the northeast and northwest are dozens of stone buildings
both large and small.  Peaking out over the walls of the city to the
south you can just barely make out mist-shrouded mountain tops looming
far off in the distance.

Inside the Southern Gates of Shadybrook~
Directly to the south of you the massive stone southern gates of
Shadybrook rise before you.  Chunks of stone have broken free from the
gates from past sieges and now litter the grassy ground in front of them. 
On either side of the gates, just above their tops, are stone watchtowers
in which you can see several vague shapes moving about.  Resting next to
the gate, set into the thick stone of the walls, is a small steel
@Wlever@n.  To the east and west small iron doors lead into the eastern
and western guard houses.  To the north the city of Shadybrook unfolds
before you; its grassy avenues passing through its many buildings.

Sunnydale Lane~
Small shrubs skirt along the edges of the lane and planted between each
of them young trees just beginning to grow.  The grass here has been
slowly torn away from the dirt from the many feet which constantly tread
across it on a daily basis, leaving large patches of dirt which have
turned into mud puddles scattered about the lane.  To the west a small
hill rises up in the center of town and several benches can be seen
positioned atop it.  To the east Sunnydale Lane continues its course

Lining the northern and southern edges of the roads are several small,

with red dots upon them.  Between each of the shrubs young trees ranging

and their trunks are only a few inches round.  Their branches are nothing

Sunnydale Lane~
Wagon ruts scar the surface of the lane, digging deep into the ground and
covering almost every inch of it.  Barely any grass remains on this strip
of road here having been torn away by wagon wheels.  Attempts to smoothen
down the road and fill in the ruts can be seen from the mound of dirt
lying just off the edge of the road and several shovels.  Nestled in a
grove of tall oak trees to the north is a small building with an open
doorway.  To the south another building stands but much smaller than the
other.  Sunnydale Lane runs east and west from here, continuing through
the city.

Sunnydale Lane~
A grove of impressive oak trees have grown along the northern edge of the
lane; their thick, long branches spanning over the street.  An occasional
breeze swirls through the area causing the branches to gently tap
together and send multi-colored leaves slowly drifting to the ground.  To
the south a small, cobblestone cottage topped with a thatched roof sits
just off the road.  The lane cuts through the hilly terrain of the city
as it advances to the east and west from here.

Sunndydale Lane and East Jezebel Avenue intersect with each other at this
point.  In the center of the road is a towering oak tree which stands at
least thirty feet high.  It rich, dark brown bark is mottled with bits of
green moss.  At the base of the tree, someone has taken the time to plant
small yellow lilacs and pink daisies.  Wagon ruts run around each side of
the tree, heading off in every direction.  Directly to the east the
massive eastern gates of the city rise up.  Sunnydale Lane heads west as
it makes its way back into the center of the city.  East Jezebel Avenue

grows which appears to glow with a pale light.  Standing off the path to
the east is the side wall of a small building topped with four chimneys
which bellow out clouds of white, black and grey smoke.  The avenue dips
down a bit to the south as it continues on its course.  To the north it

South Jezebel Avenue~
Large holes scar the surface of the avenue; each filled halfway with
thick, brown mud.  Wagon ruts run down the length of the road,
intersecting each other at points, making the road very bumpy.  A long
trench has been dug along the southern edge road in which small shrubs in
clay pots rest; still waiting to be planted.  Off to the east a ways you
can see large, thick-trunked trees skirting along the edge of the avenue. 
Off to the southwest you can just barely make out a stone watchtower
resting atop the battlements.  The avenue continues its east-west course
through the southern end of the city.

south are small stone guard houses, each with a single steel door marking
the entrance into them.  Next to the southern guard house, set into the

West Jezebel Avenue~
Dozens of rose bushes line the eastern and western sides of the avenue. 
Each of the roses are of different colors and a few are even a mixture of
several colors.  Patches of the grass here have been replaced by
wildflowers which just now have begun to bloom.  To the southeast several
stone buildings can be seen and from that direction the sweet aroma of
chocolate, freshly baked bread and sugar emanates.  West Jezebel Avenue
continues to trek around the city to the north and south from this point.

Thriving in the rich, dark soil of the grassy plains of the region are
several rose bushes which have been planted along the eastern and western
edges of the avenue.  Each of the roses is a different color, ranging
from violet to yellow.  Sharp thorns protrude from the branches and
glisten in the light like a sword's blade.  Most of the roses are still

The grass along this section of the avenue is quite different from the
rest.  Each of the blades has been changed a different color, cycling
through all the colors of a rainbow.  The city walls which loom overhead
to the west are covered in black scorch marks.  Directly off the road to
the east is a small thatched roof building covered in glowing runes and
sigils.  Sitting directly next to the building is the statue of a orc;
his face frozen as if he were screaming.  The avenue continues to the
north and south from here.

The runes and sigils which adorn the walls of the small building glow
with a deep crimson light and pulse and dim as if of their own free will. 
Peering over the runes you notice they are of different sizes and shapes
and each is surrounded by a small ring of clear rubies.

E
statue stone orc~
This large statue stands about six feet tall and has been carved into the
likeness of an orc grasping a large pike.  Every part of the statue has
been amazingly detailed right down to the orc's bushy eyebrows.  His face
is locked in a look of fear and his mouth is open wide, as if he were
screaming.  The stone which the statue has been carved from is unlike any
you have seen; parts of it are transparent and you can almost see the
orc's armor beneath it.

scattered about its base.  Dotting the grassy landscape to the west,
southwest and south are dozens of shops and homes of the citizens of
Shadybrook.  The outer walls of the city run west and south from here, as
well as the avenue which paralells it.

stone eastern walls~
The white stone walls stand over twenty feet tall and look very solid.
The eastern wall seems slightly worn away, but that was probably due to
negligence on the part of the builder who was probably in a rush to erect
the walls.
~
E
battlements catapults~
The gaps of the battlements are a few feet wide and long at the top of
the walls.  The catapults placed within the gaps have been polished and
appear immediately ready to be used in defense of the city.

shops homes~
Most of the buildings to the southwest of the city are made of stone and
painted in bright, cheerful colors.  Each is small compared to human
standards but look well-kept and unique.

East Jezebel Avenue~
The thick, stone walls of the city loom high above you to the east,
casting a dark shadow upon the avenue.  At the base of the wall several
sourberry bushes have been planted and their tiny flowers still waiting
to turn into fruit.  Off the edge of the road to the west tall maple,
oak, birch and elm trees tower up towards the sky; their thick branches
tangling with each other.  The avenue continues its north-south run
around the city, never straying from its distance from the walls.

These mighty stone walls have been made from large white marble bricks

Standing off the edge of the road to the west, like mighty obelisks, are
several oak, birch, maple and elm trees.  Each of the trees have thick,
round trunks measuring at least four feet in diameter.  Their leafy
branches spread out over the small cottages and buildings surrounding
them.  Groaning and cracking can be heard from their branches everytime a
stiff breeze blows through the area, causing them to sway gracefully.

East Jezebel Avenue~
Thick, green ivy vines drape down the length of the walls to the east of
you, snaking their way towards the center of the street.  Trampled
daisies lie scattered about the surface of the avenue, having been
crushed by the heavy traffic of the city.  A loud bubbling sound emanates
from a small marble building to the west and the distinct smell of burned
leather fills the air.  The avenue continues to run in a straight line to
the north and south from here.

East Jezebel Avenue~
Several grey rocks peak out beneath the thick layer of grass along the
avenue; some the size of a halfling's skull and others the size of a
storm giant's head.  Wagon ruts snake their way between the rocks and a
few lead straight up to them and than continue on their other side. 
Small weeds mingle with various colored flowers along the edge of the
road, each trying to overtake the other.  East Jezebel Avenue continues
to the north and south, never straying from its course parallel to the
thick city walls.

Diri's Weapons Shop~
This shop, although small, contains hundreds of weapons which hang from
its walls.  Pikes, swords, spears whips and clubs all have been neatly
set up for display across the stone walls, each polished to a high shine
and rust-free.  Resting in the southeast corner of the room are two iron
anvils, a barrel of water, a small crucible and a large iron forge.  In
the center of the room is a long wooden counter on which rest several
pieces of cheese and a large mug of ale.  An open doorway to the north is
the only exit out of the shop.

Each of the weapons is in pristine condition and free of any rust or
tarnish.  The weapons range from simple steel pikes to spiked clubs the
size of an ogre's body.  The swords are of superior design and each has
its hilt carved in the likeness of different monsters.  A large whip
hanging from the southern wall catches you attention; it measures about

This large forge is made from wrought iron and is covered in a thick
layer of soot.  A large chimney has been built above it which leads

several large steel strips resting in its red-hot coals.

Made from a long slab of birchwood, this counter is of simple design. 
Upon it rests several pieces of cheese covered in green spots and a large

Loeia's Custom Crafted Armors~
Dozens of shields, helms and suits of plate armor adorn the walls of this
tiny shop.  The entire southern wall is dedicated to shields, ranging
from small bucklers to ogre-sized tower shields of various colors and
shapes.  Shelves line the western wall of the shop and atop them rest
helms made from every type of material from leather to ivory.  Hanging
from the eastern wall are impressive suits of plate armor sized for a
halfling and larger.  In the center of the room is a simple stone table
on which rest several polishing cloths, glass vials of oil and a hefty
hammer.  To the north an open archway leads back out onto Jezebel Avenue.

This large entranceway has been lavishly decorated with paintings and
fine oak furniture.  The floor is covered in a large red carpet with the
image of a falcon soaring over snow-capped mountain peaks.  Set against
the southern wall are several small, cushioned chairs and a small oak
tabled with small carvings of halflings at play etched across its surface. 
Hanging just above the chairs is a large tapestry depicting a band of
halflings at a large festival set atop a grassy knoll.  To the east and
north gold-plated archways lead into the tavern where loud music and
laughing can be heard.  To the west a maple door leads back out onto
South Main Street.

Shadybrook Militia's Barracks~
This small building is nothing more than a hollow shell; the walls are
utterly bare of any decorations.  What little lies in the room is nothing
spectacular; a small table with four wooden chairs sits against the
northern wall and a wooden weapons rack filled with spears is set against
the eastern wall.  A small fireplace which burns with small flames has
been set against the western wall provides the only light for the room. 
In the center of the room a small black hole leads deep into the ground. 
Attached to the floor next the hole is a steel ladder which descends into
the darkness.  To the south a heavy steel door leads out onto Jezebel
Avenue.

On a Steel Ladder~
Dark, dirt walls surround you in every direction, closing in to mere
inches from your body at some points.  Twisted roots protrude from the
walls and run down the length of them.  The steel ladder bolted to the
southern wall is covered in bits of grime which make some of the steps
extremely slippery, causing you to hang on tight for fear of falling off. 
Below you the ladder descends into darkness and even the glint of its
steel cannot be seen.  Above you the ladder rises towards a small
opening, leading into a dimly lit room.

This small, cold room has been dug straight through the dirt beneath the
city.  The walls are nothing but packed dirt with a few wooden support
beams occasionally set up at weak points.  The ground is scarred by deep
ruts, left over time by the many feet which passed through this area.  To
the north a row of torches line the walls of a passageway as it heads
through the barracks.  To the east and west small doors have been set
into the earthen walls, leading to seperate chambers.  A heavy steel
ladder has been tacked to the southern wall, extending upwards into a
dark shaft.

Earthen Tunnel~
This wide tunnel has been cut directly through the hard soil beneath the
city.  Wooden support beams line the edges of the walls trying to keep
the heavy ceiling from caving-in.  Set in between each beam is a torch
which burns with a dull flame which illuminates the tunnel just enough to
see your hand in front of your face.  The air is extremely cold and with
every breath you take you can see it as you exhale.  Set into the eastern
and western walls are small oak doors.  To the north and south the tunnel
continues through the barracks.

Small bunkbeds line the walls of this small dirt chamber, each covered
with thick woolen blankets and clean uniforms.  The air is fairly damp
and cold, making this room bunkhouse a very uncomfortable living area.  A
grey stone fireplace has been carved into a gap in the western wall and
despite its blazing flames it barely lets off enough heat to break
through the biting cold.  Hanging from the southern wall is a tattered
silk tapestry with the image of two crossed swords upon it.  Set into the
eastern wall is a small oak door, covered in a thin green moss, which
leads back out of the bunkhouse.

half-empty mugs of ale and a few loaves of fresh bread.  To the east a
small oak door marks the exit out of the bunkhouse.

This small bunkhouse is extremely small, even by halfling standards.  A
small stone fireplace has been set into the southern wall which burns
brightly.  Despite the roaring fireplace the room is incredibly chilly
from being so deep underground.  Four small bunkbeds line the eastern
wall and stacked on each are neatly folded woolen blankets and cloth
sheets.  Along the nothern wall of the room are several iron braziers
which burn with red-orange flames.  Hanging from the ceiling is a large
battle standard with the image of a silvery falchion swooping down for an
attack on it.  A small oak door set into the western wall leads out of
the bunkhouse.

silk tapestries and elegant furniture.  In the northwest corner of the
room a small bed has been erected, covered in soft, red velvet blankets
and fluffy goose-down pillows.  Against the southern wall are several
large bookcases each filled with old tomes and scrolls.  A large stone
desk sits in the center of room on which rest several old empty wooden
mugs and stacks of papers.  A tapestry hanging on the northern wall
depicts a large battle between an army of heavily-armored halflings and a
band of orcs and goblins.  Set into the eastern wall is a small wooden
door leading out of the room.

portrays several halflings scampering through a forest chasing woodland
animals.  The largest tapestry which hangs from the ceiling shows a
gruesome battle between a large halfling force of infantrymen and a band

Beredin's Alchemy Supplies~
Long wooden tables covered in glass vials, beakers and jars filled with
unknown substances line the walls of this shop.  A large steel cauldron
has been setup against the southern wall which bubbles violently and
wafts tendrils of white smoke which cause your eyes to burn and water. 
The walls have been painted with murals of strange monsters ranging from
homonculi to snickering little imps.  Hanging from the ceiling is a
chandelier composed of the bones of some unknown being.  The candles
within the chandelier burn with an unnatural violet flame which
illuminates the shop just enough to see a few feet in front of you.  An
archway carved from pure obsidian has been set into the northern wall,
leading out of the shop.

wooden tables glass vials beakers jars~
These long wooden tables have been placed along every wall in this small
shop.  Upon each table are several glass vials filled with a bubbling
substance which emits a foul-smelling odor.  Beakers have been set up in
wooden racks and each is filled with a black substance which steams
constantly.  Several jars, small and large, contain live specimens of
several lizards, snakes as well as a few blobs of slime which slowly move
about the jars.
~
E
1 south wall steel cauldron~
Set up against the southern wall is a large steel cauldron resting over a
large fire pit.  The cauldron bubbles violently, sending a brown liquid
splattering against the walls and ground.  Tendrils of white smoke rise
from within it and fills the shop, causing yours eyes to burn and
water-up.
~
E
walls murals strange monsters homonculi snickering imps~
All of the walls in this shop have had colorful murals painted across
them; each depicting snickering imps in flight and homoculi feasting on
small grubs.  Each of the monsters has been well-detailed and appears
just as they would in the wilds.  The southern wall's mural catches you
eye; it depicts a gruesome scene of a winged-demon tearing a small goblin
limb from limb and feasting up its olive-green flesh.

1 up ceiling chandelier bones~
Suspended from the ceiling by a thick iron chain is a chandelier which
has been made from the bones of some unknown creature.  The bones are
blackened and charred, as if they had been exposed to an intense flame. 
Small niches in the bones have been added to hold several tallow candles
which burn with an unnatural violet flame.
~
E
tallow candles violet flame~
The candles held within the chandelier are normal tallow candles save for
the fact that they burn with an unnatural violet flame.  The light
emanting from the candles is not very bright and only illuminates the
shop enough to just barely make out its furnishings.

1 north obsidian archway~
Carved from pure obsidian, this archway has been covered in pulsating
runes of various shapes and sizes.  Each rune glows a different color
from the other and sends forth a wave of magic which causes your hairs to
stand on end.

Zaklar's Wizard's Emporium~
This shop appears more like a library than anything else due to the many
bookcases which line the walls; each filled with stone tablets and
scrolls tied up with red ribbons.  Erected in the center of the room is
an obsidian marker upon which glowing red text has been written.  Etched
into the ceiling is a rune which glows with a pale crimson light.  A
thick, bluish-colored fog rolls across the soft dirt floor and tendrils
of it slowly snake their way up your leg.  To the west a curtained
doorway leads back out of the shop.

Halfling Citizen's Home~
The walls of this house are just as bright and colorful as its exterior. 
Each wall has been painted in a combination of various yellow, green,
orange, and gold shapes.  The floor looks pretty peculiar as well, with
its alternating yellow and red checker board-like pattern.  Placed on top
of the floor is a thick, circular rug.  The rug contains a few jelly and
chocolate set-in stains.  Standing against the western wall is a long
table with a stack of fabrics of varying colors and textures.  Beside the
stack are several sets of sewn clothes that remain unfinished.  An
archway to the east leads back out to the city.

tapestry depicting a scene of a group halflings feasting in a forest
grove.  In the center of the room is a large wooden staircase which

her fury down upon armies of orcs, goblins, trolls and ogres.  The
passageway is unnaturally quiet and not even the sound of the torches or
your footsteps can be heard.  Off to the north you can see a brightly-lit
chamber in which a large altar has been erected.  To the south another

Etched along the faces of each of the slabs are carvings of halflings at
play, work and battle.  Scattered across the altar are several types of
offerings ranging from freshly-baked tarts to baskets of wildflowers.  On
each side of the altar is a life-like granite statue carved into the
likeness of the goddess.  Hanging from the eastern and western walls are
enormous silk tapestries portraying Freylia healing fallen halfling
warriors.  Ruby-encrusted braziers, each ablaze with violet-hued flames,

The unnatural silence of the temple continues throughout this section of

veil of silence.  The walls are bare of any decorations or hangings and
only the smooth, grey stone is left to look at.  Sitting low to the
ground along the edges of the walls are several iron braziers which burn
with rose-scented incense.  The dim hallway continues to the east and
west from this point, penetrating depper into the holy temple.

The eastern wall along this bend in the hallway is covered in several
dozen holy runes each pulsing with dim blue auras.  Flowing forth from
the runes are surges of power which cause your hair to stand on end and
cold shivers to run down your spine.  In the center of all the runes is a
small stone which containing a golden chalice covered in ancient text. 
Despite the glow from the runes the hallway is fairly dark, dropping
visibility down to an arms length.  The hallway continues to the west and
south where it heads into more brightly-lit sections.

Quiet Hallway~
Intricate carvings depicting a halfling army marching over a hilly
landscape cover the western wall along this section of the hallway. 
Every minute detail of the army has been carved right down to the
emblazoned images upon their armor.  Etched deeply into the stone beneath
the carvings are several lines of text worn and faded over time.  Set
into the eastern wall is a small birchwood door upon which a holy symbol
has been carved.  The hallway continues its north-south course through
the depths of the temple.

Quiet Hallway~
Four stone statues have been erected against the western wall of the
hallway; each carved in the likeness of a female halfling bedecked in
battle-worn armor and grasping a large spiked mace.  Hanging above the
heads of each statue are silk tapestries bearing the mark of Freylia upon
their surface.  Set into the eastern wall is a small birchwood door with
a single holy rune etched onto its surface.  The hallway continues to the
north and south from here, contiuning its course through the temple.

Quiet Hallway~
Ruby-encrusted braziers line the walls of this desolate hallway.  The
walls are bare of any decorations save for a few occasional cracks here
and there.  Silence fills the air and not even the sound of the flames
from the braziers can be heard.  Set into the western wall is a small
wooden door covered in glowing glyphs and runes.  The hallway heads north
from this point as it continues its course through the heart of the
temple.

The Dancing Kobold Inn - Bar Room~
This room is lit by several several torches lining the walls, each giving
off just enough light to create a sleepy atmosphere.  A long, redwood bar
has been erected a few feet away from the northern wall on which rest
several empty mugs and glasses.  Behind the bar is a large wine rack
filled with almost every type of wine known to the realm.  Surrounding
the bar are several padded wooden stools each sized for halflings and
larger beings.  Hanging upon the walls are colorful pictures of kobolds
dancing and frolicking amongst a band of halflings.  Lying directly to
the south is a softly-lit room filled with tables.

The Dancing Kobold Inn - Dining Area~
Finely crafted redwood tables covered in red tablecloths have been set up
in a neat pattern about the room.  Four cushioned wooden chairs surround
each of the tables.  Resting in the center of the tables are brass
candles holders each containing a tallow candle which burns with a dull
flame.  The floor is carpeted with a fine silken rug with the image of a
waterfall rushing down over a snow-capped mountain embroidered upon its
surface.  Upon the western wall is a large @Mmenu@n written on
tan-colored paper.  Lying off in the room to the north is a small bar
with several stools resting before it.  To the east lies the entranceway
into the inn.

The Jolly Halfling Tavern - Table-Filled Room~
The distinct smell of cigar smoke, roasted chicken and alcohol fill the
air of this large room.  Tables have been scattered about the room in a
disorganized fashion; each cluttered with dirty plates and mugs.  Several
of the chairs that rest beneath the tables have been knocked over and
some broken into small pieces which now litter the ground.  Hanging from
the western wall are two small pictures of rolling, grassy hills covered
in patches of wildflowers.  Set into the northern wall is a small stone
fireplace ablaze with red-orange flames.  To the south a gold-plated
archways leads into the foyer.  To the east a long wooden bar can be seen
running along the walls.

The Jolly Halfling Tavern - Bartender's Station~
Protruding from the northern wall, curving, and than stopping at the
eastern wall is a long wooden bar covered in empty glasses and mugs. 
Positioned along the length of the bar are several bar stools; most sized
for a halfling but some fit for someone the size of an ent.  Behind the
bar are several large cases filled with bottles of almost every type of
ale and other alcohol.  Hanging from the ceiling is a large steel
chandelier filled with large tallow candles which illuminate the tavern
brightly.  To the south and west are large, smoke-filled rooms in which
you can see several tables scattered about.

The Jolly Halfling Tavern - Table-Filled Room~
Twelve wooden tables cluttered with empty and full mugs have been
scattered about this large room.  The air is filled with thick, rolling
clouds of smoke and the distinct odor of beer and cigar smoke.  The floor
is littered with pieces of food, mud, and small piles of ashes.  Upon the
eastern wall is a large, framed portrait of a merry-looking halfling
dancing with a blonde-haired maiden.  Off to the north, through the thick
clouds of smoke, you can just barely make out a long wooden bar.  To the
west a gold-plated archway leads out to the foyer.

Northern Guard House~
Wooden weapon racks line the walls of this small stone guardhouse, each
filled with spears, pikes, javelins and swords.  In the center of the
room is a small wooden table surrounded by four padded chairs.  An iron
stove has been set against the eastern wall on which a black iron kettle
filled with coffee rests.  An elegant silk tapestry bearing the mark of
the Shadybrook militia hangs from the southern wall.  A stone staircase
lies along the northern wall, leading up to the watchtower.  To the west
a small stone door leads back out of the guard house.

Northern Watchtower~
This stone watchtower gives an excellent view of the surrounding wilds,
allowing the watchmen of the city of view threats coming from any angle. 
The grassy, rolling hills of the wilds stretch out to the northeast and
northwest of you, going on for several miles.  Directly to the west, just
below you, are the northern gates of the city behind which you can see
the gate guards standing.  Set against the southern wall is an open
iron-bound chest filled with crossbow bolts, spears and flasks of oil
attached to rags.  To the east a small stone door leads out onto the
battlements surrounding the city.  Set against the northern edge of the
tower is a stone staircase leading down into the guard house.

Many tools of siege repelling can be found scattered about the floor of

flasks with rags shoved into them.  The four open faces of the watchtower
allow a clear view of the vast wilds to the north, east, and west while
the view to the south allows the watchmen a clear, birds eye view of the
city.  Several miles to the west you can catch a brief glimpse of lush
green tree tops of a vast forest.  On the northern end of the watchtower
a simple stone staircase leads down to the guard house below.

This small stone chamber is sparcely decorated; only a few pieces of
furniture of simple design have been scattered about the room.  A small
four-post wooden bed has been setup against the western wall; covered in
a simple cloth sheet and a single pillow.  A stone washbasin has been set
against the northern wall and sitting beside it is a small bucket of
fresh, cool water.  Set against the southern wall is an open wardrobe
which contains several white and red clergy uniforms.  A small oak door
has been set into the eastern wall, leading out of the room.

walls are void of any decorations but you can see the faint impressions
of where pictures once hanged.  Set into the eastern wall is a small
birchwood door which leads back out into the main hallway of the temple.

eastern wall is a small maple desk upon which rest several scrolls tied
neatly with yellow ribbons.  A single torch hangs from the northern wall
which provides very little light for the room.  A small birchwood door
lies directly to the west, leading out of the clergy's quarters.

An array of pastel colors fills the walls of this small home, giving it a
cozy yet festive feel.  Gazing up is like looking at the sky as the
ceiling is painted in turquoise, with cloud-like shapes spaced
intermittently.  A desk made of cedar wood stands against the northern
wall, cluttered with all sorts of wrinkled up paper and thick, leather-
bound books.  Beside the desk is a comfortable-looking bed covered in a
soft, furry purple blanket.  A small wooden door has been set to the east. 
Hung to the left of the door is a painting of a halfling child frolicking
on a hilltop.

Halfling Citizen's Home~
The sweet smell of cookie dough flows throughout this house.  The scent
seems to originate from a round wooden table that stands shakily at the
corner of the room.  Stacks of cakes sit atop the table, but seem ready
to topple over if their delicate balance is disturbed.  Set against the
northern wall are a few windows that remain closed, thereby keeping the
most of the aroma confined within the home.  Thin orange curtains drape
the sides of the window, and some have brown smudges on them.  To the
west is a small wooden door that leads back out to the city.

This cozy little home is furnished with all sorts of peculiar furniture

ceiling are unusual-looking trinkets.  Some are silvery metal chimes,
glass pendants, and folded paper animals.  Other trinkets lie in the
corner in an unorganized pile, as though the owner didn't even know what
to do with them.  At another end of the room is a small bed covered in a
thick, plush blanket with bright, flowery designs.  Attached to the
wooden beams at the four corners of the bed are silk drapes.  Woven into
the drapes are scenes of halflings skipping up a green hill.

A thick yellow carpet has been spread all across the floor of this cozy

Hung along each wall and encircling the room are numerous paintings
depicting a festively plump halfling holding or munching on a tasty-
looking dessert.  At the northwestern corner of the room is a five-
foot long bed made of mahogany wood.  About a dozen pillows in various
shapes and sizes have been stacked on the bed, and several cake crumbs
have been scattered randomly along the bed.

A wooden bed in the northeastern corner is one of the few items that

sagging, and the bed's wooden frame appears worn and fragile.  Scattered
randomly along the wooden floor boards are several stalks of straw
covered in clumps of mud.  The straw most likely fell from the weathered
thatch roof above you.  To the west is a small wooden door with loose
hinges that leads out to the city.

pleasant aesthetic qualities of the house.  In the middle of the house is
a halfling-sized rocking chair made of dark mahogany wood.  Its lacquered
finish gives the chair a shiny new look.  Beside the chair is a wide bed
with numerous fluffy pillows stacked upon it.  A red brick fireplace with
a few pine logs still remaining in it lies to the north.  Hung just above
the fireplace is an acrylic painting of a young smiling halfling couple
frolicking along a lush green hillside.  A small wooden door to the south
leads back outside to the city.

The interior of this house applies a few unusual designs to fit the
unique tastes of its inhabitants.  The walls have been painted in bright
green and orange, with large splotches of yellow added for flair. 
Attached around the walls in a continuous V-shaped pattern are
well-preserved tulips, daisies, and sunflowers.  Their scent is still
powerful and pleasant.  Resting against the northern wall is a bookshelf
containing a large number of books and writing paper.  Facing the
bookshelf is a messy desk filled with flowers, pens, and cookie crumbs. 
A small wooden door with a single red rose painted on it lies to the east.

blue walls is an array of oil paintings of various flowers and plants,
most of which are familiar looking but their names elude your memory.  A
couple of shelves span the northern wall.  Spades, clay pots, and other
gardening equipment have been stored on the shelves.  Resting in a neat
pile at the northeast corner of the room are several large bags of soil
and fertilizer.  Beside the pile is a watering pot that is half empty. 
To the east is a small door that leads back outside.

A lush, red carpet covers the area around the staircase and has
embroidered with the image of a herd of antelope running across a grassy
plain.  A simple, glass-covered lantern hangs from the western wall
providing just enough light to see what lies around you.  In the center

the inn.  Directly to the south lies a brightly-lit room filled with

Alixi's Riding Supplies~
Large iron forges, crucibles and anvils have been placed along the
southern wall of this building.  Forging hammers and metal tongs hang
from the western wall and beneath them resting on a wooden shelf are
several stacks of horse shoes.  The eastern side of the room is cluttered
with stacks of saddles, bridles and various types of barding.  In the
center of the room is a life-sized dummy of a heavy warhorse on which
rests a suit of highly-polished scale mail barding.  To the north an
opening in the wall leads into another section of the building.

1 south wall iron forges crucibles anvils~
Placed against the southern wall are several blacksmithing items ranging
from forges to crucidbles.  Set in the southwestern corner of the room
are two large iron forges which waft strong waves of heat every few
moments.  Placed next to them are four steel crucibles in which you can
see solidified iron deposits.  Next to the crucibles are eight small
anvils suited for someone the size of a halfling.  The anvils are covered
in large dents as well as a few dozen scratch marks which dig deep into
their metal.

dummy is a suit of highly-polished scale mail barding which gleams in the
light.
