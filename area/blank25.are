Scarlet Altar~
On all sides and above you you see ancient trees blocking all sight of
what is beyond them.  Before them is a carefully placed ring of stones
worn by the ages.  This obviously is a place of power.  At your feet you
see a blood covered altar made of a strange fiery red stone, that has
fallen into severe disarray.  Upon taking a closer look at the altar, you
see that some of the blood is surprisingly fresh and is running down some
rivulets that are etched into the shape of a sword.

bowl bowls~
The separated bowls are made of stone.  You can see steam rising from the
fresh blood which pools within them.
~
E
stones~
The stones create a semi-circle before the trees.  Perhaps their presence
helps to increase the power of the altar.  The faces of the stones are
pitted from many sword blows.

From the corpse lying on the altar, a column of flame shoots up into the
sky illuminating the country side for leagues!  As the fire slowly dies
out, you see a shimmering gateway left in its wake.

As you gaze at the corpse upon the altar, pondering the mystery of it
all, you notice that the corpse has begun to steam!

As you look at the corpse on the altar you wonder to yourself why you
have made a sacrifice on this barely recognizable altar.  Was it of your
own free will or was someone pulling your strings.

You gag as you watch $n drink the blood from the bowls.  $n slips into a

You feel empowered by the gods as you quench your thirst with the blood
within the bowls.  Unfortunately, the power subsides just as quickly.

Forest Valley - Faint Path~
You are on a barely visible path that winds into a dense patch of trees. 
To the north you can see light streaming down, but to the west you can
only see darkness as you approach the center of the thicket.  
~
put loops here for pets to enter bushes too.

Lava Pool~
As you look around this room you see countless small openings in the
walls, none of which are any bigger than your head.  As you study these
looking for a way out you notice smoke is begining to pour out of each of
the openings.

Forest Path~
You are on a very faint path in a section of very old trees.  Their
branches are so interwoven by time that no sign of the sky can be seen. 
To the south you can make out a carefully placed ring of stones.  The
trees have encroached on the ring for many years and it looks like it is
a place of ancient times.

Forest Path~
The path turns again to follow the river, which in the distance enters
the ring of cliffs surrounding this plateau.  The cliffs are notched by a
small canyon to the south, and the river paces the path to the west.
