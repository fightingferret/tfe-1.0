Theatre Entrance~
On this side of the entrance doors is a huge wooden arch walkway leading
to the arena of the theatre complex.  Poster advertisements announcing
the shows that have played at the theatre decorate the sides of the walls. 
Old candlesticks on the walls keep the otherwise dark walkway lit. 
Painted on the ceiling is a fluffy cloudscape, but some of the paint
appears chipped revealing its age.

Theatre Entrance~
This end of the tunnel appears to be the admission area.  A cracked
wooden @Csign@n hangs from a chain above the entrance.  The wooden walls
are made of a heavy, slightly weathered oak that has very few knot holes.
Fewer posters line the walls here and are also rather weathered and faded
from a long life of being stuck to a wall.

Little pieces of grass stick up occasionally through the dirt and gravel.

You stand in the center of the entire theatre.  The audience's pit is
very large and must be able to fit an insane number of people in here.  A
little bit of dirt kicks up on your legs as you walk through the pit.. 
Several bits of trash litter the ground around your feet as if the place
hasn't been cleaned in years.

The expanse of dirt and gravel continues in all directions.  Off to the

Dirt and gravel cover the ground of the theatre.  The dirt is a reddish
orange color which hides some of the gray color on the gravel.  There is
a platform far to the north, but it is very difficult to see from this
part of the theatre.  A small distance to the west is a set of stairs
leading up to a gallery of seats.

The stage is made of several wooden planks that extend from the wall of

feet higher from the pit, it seems much higher.  To the north is a
curtain leading to the back of the stage area.

[Finius] add that if you try to go south, "Your anima prevents you from
jumping off the stage to the dirt floor below" or somthing like that.

In the Audience~
This part of the pit seems to be on a higher gradient than the other
areas of the audience.  Not quite in the center of the arena, you still
have a pretty good view of the stage.  A little ways to the east is a
seating gallery, and to the north is the large stage platform.

You stand directly in front of the east side of the stage.  However, it
is so tall that it is very difficult to see anything on the stage.  The
wall behind the stage seems to tower above your head about fifty or sixty
feet.  Seating galleries lie to the east and west, and more standing room
lies to the south.

Seats in the West Gallery appear to be about five feet higher than the

for a much better view of the platform stage...  even if it is far away.

Holes about the size of a copper piece seem to infest the roof above you

The booklet has a play dialogue printed in it, but several handmade
markings have been scribbled in the book.

The markings say,
"Note to self: Hire a helpful individual who can find a singer to come
and perform at the theatre.  I think my Sutler friend said something
about knowing a singer."

The booklet appears to be a script of some sort.  It also appears that

Backstage~
Discarded on the floor are several hats and wigs of many varieties.  Most
of the hats seem to be royal in nature, but there are a few rags commonly
worn by commoners.  All of them are in worthless condition and would
probably rip or fall apart if they were picked up.

Before a Spiraling Steel Staircase~
A tall staircase, pounded out of sheets of steel, spirals up to a
circular hole in the ceiling.  As the staircase enters the hole in the
ceiling, it seems to disappear into the darkness of the second level. 
The only exits from this room are to the Backstage towards the east, to a
corridor towards the south, and up into the darkness.

Not so much cruel as to keep from everyone having a copy of each key to

rectangular in nature, but others are shaped oddly like trapezoids and

Path to the Theatre~
The tall grassy path gradually turns into a dirt path heading north
towards the wooden structure and west towards the cliff.  Heavy brush and
weeds surround the dirt path, blocking passage to the east and the south. 
A sign has been posted on a rotting wooden stake in the ground.

The Top of a Cliff~
The winds on top of the cliff pick up a little as you look out off
towards the west.  Far in the distance you can see a suspension bridge
hanging over a ravine.  To the northeast is a large wooden building with
huge doors at the front.  It is difficult to see much detail through the
trees and brush, but the building looks like it has no windows.

An eighty foot drop awaits those who foolishly try to walk down the steep

E
building wooden~
The building stands alone in the distance.  It appears to be made of a
light-colored wood and has dark wooden doors in the front.  From this
vantage point the doors look like the only way in or out of the building.

Before the Face of a Cliff~
A craggy rock cliff stands before you and blocks your travel towards the
east.  Several rocks and holes adorn the face of the cliff and makes it
look perhaps climbable.  However, the cliff looks very tall and
treacherous.  Scaling this wall of rock would be quite a chore.

The cliff stands several dozen feet high and is very craggy and rough.  The
protruding rocks are few and far in between, but the cliff looks like it
has an adequate number of footholds.

Faint Path Through the Hills~
The path is very faint and almost invisible.  Tall grass extends from the
ground and makes walking very strenuous even to the most experienced
adventurer.  You notice that some of the tall grass has recently been
trodden on towards the east.  The path continues up the hill to the east
towards a cliff.
