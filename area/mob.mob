filling empty mugs.  Despite his weak and cowardly appearance, it is
rumored that Jzyahk is actually a goblin war leader in some far off land.

a strange fog rolling into our forest.  We thought it to be nothing but
simple weather but that night we found out that a clan of dark faeries
were the cause of it.  No sooner did they make their presence known they
launched an attack an attack against us.  Many a brave gnome fought
valiantly and even our friends the sea sprites came to our aid but all in
vain.  The faeries killed several of our bravest warriors and spared no
one, not even the women and children.  We quickly fled the forest and
many of us were tracked down and killed while making our escape.  The
dark faeries have since engaged in a great war with the sea sprites and i
fear they cannot hold out long.  But there is nothing that can be done,
fate will determine the outcome of the conflict but now i can rest, no
longer having to live in this hell of unlife.  Thank you my friend and
please, destroy the faeries before they launch their attack against the
sprites and even than..maybe against Chiiron itself."@n

This little crab has a dark green shell and its eye stalks stick straight
up.  Its claws are small but jagged.  They look capable of crushing any
fishy prey.  The crab's mandibles bubble profusely and appear to be in a
constant state of motion.

I recently was in the Forest of Medienne and let me tell you, that forest
can be mean.  I encountered a host of animated, undead creatures being
controlled by a twisted man in one part of the forest and a renegade orc
nearly killed me for going down into his cabin.  It'll be a long time
before I dare venture back!

My nephew, may the gods keep watch over his soul, disappeared about three

@GWhen it began though we were in the prime of our youth, both of usss
young huntersss for our tribesss.  Though I was better with sssword and
fissst ssshe wasss my sssuperior with a ssspear, better than any other in
our tribesss asss well.  We were young then, asss I sssaid, and our

@GIt wasss probably for that very reassson that we made sssuch fine

The old lizardman draws a few slow, steadying breaths before continuing.
~
E

@GWe were at war then, alwaysss waring with each other.  One tribe
fighting with each other for teritory, hunting rightsss, or even jussst
to prove who wasss the ssstronger.  It wasss a hard time; it wasss a
gloriousss time.
~
E
past6~
@GMy tribe wasss ssstrong, the tribe of the Soskeni.  We had one of the
larger tractsss of the ssswamp in our care for a long time before even I
wasss hatched.  When our turn came, we held it asss alwaysss, adding more
to it asss we could.
~
E

@GT'syanath was Kuldumaris.
~
E

The old lizardman continues...
@G
T'syanath had met in our youth, and though our tribesss fought we had
found peace.  It wasss not until her tribe and mine became the focusss
for all the conflict; until all the other tribesss chopssse one ssside or
the other that the trouble began.
~
E
past10~
@GAsss you can imagine, after yearsss of meeting in sssecret, after the
hapinessss we had found, we knew we would eventually have to fight if we
took sssidesss on the field of battle.  And the time wasss fassst
approaching when it would come to that if we did not act.  We had both
overheard the eldersss talking of a blood war to come, where each ssside
would vow to completely dessstroy the other or die in the attempt.
~
E
past11~
@GBeing warriorsss of the sssword and ssspear we thought firssst asss
warriorsss then and could come up with no better plan then to bring our
people together in combat to ssshow how much better we could fight
together asss alliesss than asss enemiesss.  On the eve before the blood
war began we each led a party of brave warriorsss to a place telling them
we were going to ambusssh a hunting party the other had camped there.  To
them, it no doubt sssounded a grand begining to a gloriousss war.
~
E
past12~
@GWhat the othersss did not know isss that a rather large sssklissss had
recently taken up resssidence in teh very ssspot we were headed to, and
T'syanath and I both knew that once both sssidesss were forced to fight
the sssklissss, essspecially one of thisss sssize, we would have to fight
asss one people for our very sssurvival even.  Surely, we thought, thisss
would be the firssst ssstep towardsss preventing a war we did not want
to happen.

@GWe greatly underssstimated the ssstrength of thisss sssklissss and our

nearby rock and fell unconsssciousss.  When I awoke, it wasss over.  From
the tracksss I pieced together what had happened.  Mossst were ssslain,
two managed to essscape and one of them I found dead halfway back to
hisss camp.  Many of the dead were half eaten by the sssklissss and two
were devoured entirely.  And, among the dead lay my poor T'syanath, a
victim of our ssschemesss.

@GI feared the truth would come out, sssomehow, ssso I concealed what
happened to her and I.  With the carnage it wasss easssy.  To the

sssklissss.  Then I took her off to a sssacred place ssso her final
ressst would no longer be disssturbed.  Then I left my landsss and my
tribe and have never returned.

Finally the old lizardman concludes...

@GI have many adventuresss sssince then, alwaysss moving forward, alwaysss

@GThe Kuldumaris were one of the many tribes that once roamed the Kissk
many years back.  One of the great ones, and my tribes chief rivals.

They were easy to mark on the field of battle as most were born with a
streak of crimson scales running along either side of the head and neck. 
Being visible made them easy targets until they proved their fierceness,
then it became a sign that warned others to back off.  A people as fierce

This snake is coiled and ready to strike.  His body is a brownish color
and completely covered with a scaly skin.  His tongue flickers in and
out of his mouth as his beady, black eyes peer at you intently.  However,
his tail is what draws your attention as it gently rattles back and

The raven hops here and there, turning the side of it's head this way and

from the tales you've heard about these types of birds being minions of

"Twas about five years ago now that Zarander came to these parts.  He was
a skinny young lad the day I saw him ride by and up the hill.  He only
had about three or four servants with him but there was a couple of carts
with him full of equipment and furniture.  Anyhow I didn't think much of
it that day, but was about a week later when I was flying about that
'poof' this ruddy great tower appeared right in me flight path.  I nearly
fell off me broomstick.  
  
Anyway he turns up at me door the next day an' want me to scry up his
future.  Me!  little ol me, do a reading for a mage that can make ruddy
great towers sneak up on a poor old defenceless witch.  So anyways I sat
'im down an got out me crystal ball and turn me around three times and
call me a cabbage but shure as there are flys on a dead dog he was a
Doomed man.  
  
It seems he had killed the lover of some evil sorceress and now she was
out to get him.  Because once she found the body of her mate so great was
her anguish that she took her own life and proclaimed a curse upon the
wizard.  Let me tell you an' I should know being in the business meself -
that the curse of a suiciding lover is a pretty big curse.  And when you
add in she was an evil sorceress and her lover wasn't exactly squeaky
clean either I can tell you that is one pretty pokey curse.  
  
I never did see what was going to happen only his past and then a big
black wall in his future.  Hmmm about a year after that though there was
some invisible force holding it close to the building.  There were a few
more explosions and then just quiet like.  
  
That evening I was back at home when one of his familars shows up ere you
can ask him the rest of the storey me throat's all sore after all this
yacking.

Vibrant red hair, not the brassy red of tavern wenches, but the blazing
crimson of a sunset over the sea draws your attention like a moth to a

hue of her tresses, accenting the delicate features in an unearthly face. 
Unearthly blue eyes meet and capture yours, and you suddenly feel as if
this woman has read your very soul, and knows your very deepest secrets. 
Just as you feel she has completely discounted your very existance, she
smiles at you, an expression akin to an ancient mother goddess, looking
over her children.

hulking, scarred~

This large creature might stand eight feet tall were he not so burdened
with his own weight.  His misshapen, humanoid face is twisted with angry
red weals and his body is covered with scars.  In several places, his
dark brown fur has even refused to grow back.  Burdened even as he is by
his bulk, the large bugbear has an air of authority about him.  Around
his head you can see the gleam of iron peaking out from beneath some fur.

The features of this creature are gnarled and haggard.  Flesh clings to
its distorted, humanoid face like dessicated flesh on a two-week dead cow. 
Dark brown fur covers his body almost entirely, save for his face and
hands.  Strings of bones and dull-colored feathered have been tied into
its long fur and trail down the back of his head.  An air of
spiritualness and a smell of putrid slime hovers around the bugbear like
a swarm of locusts scouring for grain.

You see before you a truly horrible man.  He is bent and twisted like
the forest around you.  It appears that he has been working on this part
of the forest for many many years, twisting the trees with his axe and
wooden braces and also catching and twisting the poor animals in this
part of the forest.  His eyes bulge out of his head and you can hear 
him mumbling "now thee is as twisted as me!" as he breaks the leg of
another poor little animal.

While I am a master at my craft, I would not be so brazen as to claim the

means to smelt the ore with flames hotter than I dare use in these

I would suggest one of my fine weapons, but if you still seek a fine

I can reason out easily enough why it is you ask me about the starwater. 
It can only be that you seek it for the High Druid.  If he has sent you

Honor is the measure and worth of a person.  It is the fundament of true

E
honor2~
As long as you remain honorable, your blade shall strike truer and fairer. 
You mind's eye will see unclouded the taint on the souls of others.
~
E
honor3~
If you are to earn the mark of the Shuvanaguard, you are also accepting
all that stands with it; both the honor and the duty.
~
E
honor4~
Your duty remains with the Guard no matter where you travel.  You must
place your faith in each other and use your adopted kinship to protect
the woods and all life.
~
E
honor5~
As long as you remain true to your duty, the strength of your blade will
reflect your station.
~
E
honor6~
Break with that duty and your honor is sullied.  Once sullied, the taint
will mar your blade and it may very well shatter when it is most needed.
~
E
honor7~
If you would hold your honor so high, if you would accept that heavy
burden of unyielding duty, then go forth towards Castle Lag.  Near the
gates of Castle Lag resides a champion of the forest, a dryad.  She may
be last to know if any source of starwater remains in the realms.
~
E

Your blade is a reflection of your honor and duty.  In essence your blade
is your honor.  Lose it and you lose your honor though your duty remains.

Perhaps a magical creation, or some kind of minature devil you are not

Its skin is marked with grey undertones, and its hands and feet are

red slits with irises of an even darker, blood red hue.

sit here, making strange motions with their hands.~
This elderly elf is known by the tribes as 'The Sailor'.  He was not
named thus because he sails ships, he was named thus because of his
strange skills to sail in other ways.  He has found a way to secure items
and things, and the elves come to him to have their excess gold and
valuables held in safety.

Before you stands a huge 8' tall humanoid in glossy black full plate

A huge Bastard sword is sheathed at its side the hilt tipped with a
giant black star sapphire.  Behind its visored helm two bright crimson

Though it is difficult to see him precisely through the thick sludge of
the sewage you get the distinct impression that this is a frog. 
Although, for a frog, this one is enormous.  From the glimpses you catch
of it in the cloudy debris it seems to have a body that measures a good
four feet long, and that doesn't include the full length of its strong
back legs.  Further hampering your efforts to view it is the excellent
camouflage of its skin, almost precisely the color of the sewage it
lives in.

found in one of the new tunnels.  This metal which was later named
Krynite, was magical in nature and stirred up alot of commotion.  With
all the ruckus surrounding it, word of it soon spread across the land.  

Before we even knew what had happened, a coven of Warlocks and their
horrible golems came and drove us out of the mine.  They sealed off the
tunnel where the ore was found with a great iron door.

Many of my people were captured and even now serve them as slaves, deep
under the closed off earth.  Among them was my brother Grunnod.  My
father and two of my other brothers were slain while defending this
place.  I myself managed to escape when a fire broke out, sending many of

And lets not forget the Warlocks.  They are pure evil and seek nothing
but the destruction and enslavement of others.  These spell shapers can
control powerfull magics and should be avoided.

rest here, their bodies partially covering-up a wheelbarrow.~
The creature possesses the least desirable characteristics of garden
worms, being slimy and possessed of brownish pink segments as well as
huge.  It will eat almost anything, animal flesh being a favorite dish,
but roots and fungus are an acceptable alternative.  It does not,
however, eat rock, despite persistent Dwarvish legends to the contrary. 
Rather, it uses the six hard horns on its bony head as drill bits to bore
a way through soft stone, sliding along on its mucus as it goes.  A bony
ridge protects its jaws and narrow eyes during this boring activity.

They are using the magic metal for the creation of a horrible golem,
which when finished, will be unleashed upon the earth.  Given the strange
properties of Krynite, it is unclear what horrible things the golem will
be able to do to us all, but one thing is clear.  The warlocks must be

all, they don't fight honorably.  They'll prefer to hide in the shadows
and attack you quickly from behind then run away, setting traps

the town.  If you're looking for him, you'll have to search the trails
carefully.  If he wants you to find him, you will.  I've heard it said

have been written for new players such as yourself.  You might consider

monk~
I see you have chosen the inner path.  The way of the monk is not the way
of blades or spells.  It is the path of inner wisdom, enlightenment, and
perpetual balance.  If you are to succeed on your inner quest I would
advise you to visit the Swordsman above the Fighting Ferret.  While he
weilds a blade of steel, he has learned much and knows some things that
will begin you on your path.  He would be glad to train you if you go and
'@bpractice@n' with him.  Should you get lost, the Fighting Ferret is marked
on the town map, see for yourself by typing 'help Chiiron'.
~
E
ranger~
Ah, noble friend of the woods.  Scout, forager, guide.  All this you are
and more, friend ranger.  You will face many trails alone in your travels.
I would advise you begin your training while here in town.  You can learn
much from the local mage Prenslie, the priestess, and the weapon trainer. 
All of them would be glad to train you if you will just go and '@bpractice@n'
with them.  Their shops are marked on the town map under 'help Chiiron'.
When you visit the weapon trainer, I would also advice buying a weapon
from him to defend youself in the wilds.
~
E
paladin~
Ah, I see you have chosen to follow the path of the holy warrior.  As a
paladin you will be tried by both the forces of good and evil.  If you
are to succeed in your holy vows you would do best to seek training from
the priestess south of here and the weapon trainer two west and one south
of here.  Both would be eager to train you if you should just '@bpractice@n'
with them.  You would be well advised to buy a weapon from the weapon
trainer while you are there.  His shop resides two west and one south of
here.  Should you get lost, a map is available under 'help Chiiron'.
~
E

~
E

~
E
other~
I see you know nothing of the magical or clerical arts, so you should

advise practicing sword and buying a weapon from him.  I would also
explore the rest of town - there is a map under 'help Chiiron'.
~
E
cleric~
I see you are a cleric.  A wise choice.  If you want to learn spells, go
south of here and see the priestess.  She can teach you if you go to here
and '@bpractice@n'.  Before you leave town, you should find the weaponsmith
and purchase a mace or staff.  In order to view a map of the city, type
'help Chiiron'.
~
E
mage~
I see you are a mage.  The first thing you should know is that Prenslie,
the magic shop owner, teaches spells.  He is often north and east of
here, minding his shop.  Before you leave town, you should find the
weaponsmith and purchase a staff or dagger.  Without it, you will have
little chance.  Type 'abil spell' to find out what spells you have.  If
you want Prenslie to train you, the command to know is '@bpractice@n.'
In order to view a map of the city, type 'help Chiiron'.

When ready to adventure, you should leave town by the north or east gate. 
Do so by pulling on the lever.  To the north are frogs and trout, to the
east is a larger area with rabbits, goats and foxes.  If the gate is
closed when you return, @bknock@n on it and the guards should let you
back in.  If they are closed and you need out of the city, simply @bpull
lever@n to open the gate.  If you kill a rabbit, you want to @bskin@n it. 
If you are able to skin it successfully, bring the skin back to town and
sell it to Peter for gold.  His shop is marked on the map, see for
yourself, just type 'help Chiiron'.  I wish you luck on your journeys.

Bartenders are notorious for the amount of information they store. 
Whenever you want to find something out about the local area, try talking
to a bartender (@btell <name/bartender> hi@n).  When you are done here,
go try it in the Fighting Ferret, located west and south of here.
~
E
introduce~
You can also @bintroduce@n yourself to others.  Before you introduce
yourself, people will only see your @bappearance@n and will not know your
name.  This is useful once you become friends with another player.  The
command @bintroduce <target person>@n will work, and if you feel
comfortable enough with them to introduce yourself, then they will quite
likely reciprocate.  An additional step of friendship comes with the
@bbefriend @n command.  If you die, only your true friends - those people
whom you have befriended - may pick up your corpse.  Make sure that you
trust those people whom you befriend - even more so than those
individuals to whom you have introduced yourself.

I have fond memories of pets over the many years.  They have given me
comfort, joy, and often times even save my life in combat.  There are
shops in some towns where pets are tamed and trained to be of assistance. 
Once purchased they will follow you loyally obeying what you '@border@n'
them to do.  If you '@border dog sit@n' he will do so until you command
him otherwise.  In combat pets may assist you (use 'option pet_assist')
even to their death.  They wil remain loyal until they die, or until you
release them (see 'help pet').  Be warned, it takes time to learn to
control your pet and they wil be limited in size by your experience in
this world.  Should you ever lose your pets, simply @bwhistle@n. 
Provided they are near by and are not asleep, they will slowly try to
find you.
~
E
ranger~
Ah, companion of the woods, to you the animals are more than pets are
they not?  They a friends who will fight at your side.  Others will go to
shops in the towns where people have trained animals to obey, you also
may do this.  For you there also exists the knowledge that you may one
day learn to charm the animals with your woodland magic and they will
travel with you willingly.  Both the trained pets of the shops, and the
freer animals you may meet, can be a boon in a fight for you life, as
they may aid you (use 'option pet_assist').  Be warned, it takes time to
control a pet the number and strength of the pets you control wlil be
limited by your experience in this world.  However, all of your pets will
obey your '@bcommand@n'.  Thus if you '@bcommand wolf sit@n' it will do
so until commanded otherwise.  If you lose your pets, simply @bwhistle@n. 
Provided they are near by and are not asleep, they will slowly try to

and @bShout@n (100 points per use).  You can toggle the channels on/off by

human shot the bolt, but I hope he suffered at least as horribly as our
Lord King.  
     
I caught him as he slumped to the ground, and his queen closed his eyes
after he breathed his last.  He died in the throneroom...  the room from
which he would have ruled us with the kindness and gentleness that came
so natural to him.  Faeries never really die, you know.  We just change
forms.  Be sure to shake the hand of my lord if you should see him on
your journeys.  He led us well.  He is worthy of honor."

~
E
go_east~
The starwater only exists in one place now, a single spring located in
the Vaasa itself.  Go forth into the Vaasa and seek out a spring that
sparkles with captured energy of the stars.
~
E
falling_star~
Once, long ago several stars fell down from the heavens, burying
themselves deep withing the ground.  Over time they yeilded their energy
slowly back into the sky, as small flashes of light released into the
deep waters.  As the water bubbled forth upon the lands, the light was
released for any who looked to see.  Over time, most have returned fully
to the sky.
~
E
warned~
Be warned, however, that the starwater must be collected properly or it
will become nothing more than water.  For it to retain its magical
properties, it must be gathered in a special container by one blessed by
a dryad.  Along the shores of the Elhanni river you can find the remnant
of earth that once held one of the falling stars.  Gather clay from its
shores and bring it to Chrysl so that she may fashion the proper
container for the waters, then you will have what you seek.
~
E
end~
The dryads voice calls after you a final bit of advice.  Try not to touch
the water of the spring while filling the cup, merely @bdip@n the cup
into the spring and gather what starwater you can that way.  If you do it
right, the water will respond to your actions with a gentle glow.
~
E
bless~
The dryad offers you her blessing that you may collect the starwater. 
Reaching forth the dryad lays a leaf-entwined hand lightly upon your brow
and whispers something sounding like nothing so much as a gentle breeze
rustling through the leaves of a tree.
~
E
one_shot~
The blessing will last until you have gathered enough starwater to fill
the container Chrysl will fashion for you.  Should you drop it or lose it
before you complete the quest it will not work for you again.  Guard the
starwater well, for you will have but one chance in this.

The faeries don't allow me in the castle yet, but I know of a secret
passageway that I sometimes use to check on the humans that are still

This plant is growing very quickly.  It is covering all the other plants

hist~
Many generations ago we lived as nomads, wandering around the swamp to
follow the food.  This was right after the great upheaval, when the
valley sank from the forest.  We had a nice village in that forest until
the gods destroyed it.

As nomads we fractrured into various tribes, each following a different
vision, waring among each other.  Though we fought amongst ourselves we
learned strength of a necessity.  Then, over the years, two tribes came
into dominance over all the others and soon the others fell into line
behind one or the other of the two clans.

Then, on the eve before a blood war was begun between the two factions a
sorrowful tragedy befell the clans and in their grief they were united. 
Soon after the clans were again united and our village was built.  Though
we have travelled a painful road and fought hardship and chaos it has
taught us wisdom in the end.

E
mage~
I see you are a mage, I would suggest you seek out Athlynius, he is a
great magician.  His humble shop is in a secluded area to the south west. 
He should be able to teach you some basic spells.  You should also go and
see Saurd, the great weaponsmith, he can sell you daggers and staves
suitable for the fine art of fighting.  Saurd can be found in the trees
above, and near the entrance to the city.

E
cleric~
I see you are a cleric, I would suggest that you find the cleric who
resides in the celestial observatory to the south west.  I believe that
he should be able to help you learn spells.  I would also suggest seeking
out Saurd, the great weaponsmith, and ask if he can teach you about maces
or staves.  Saurd can be found in the trees above, and near the entrance
to the city.

Aha, I see you are a monk.  Well, you would have little use for the
weapons we could craft here.  Neither would any of the spellcraft our
masters know be of any use to you.  About all we could offer you here
might be armor that you may find of use.  If you seek more than that I
would suggest you seek out the monastary somewhere on the other side of
the Dragonspire Mountains.

I must warn you of two places, first a strange rock formation called
Hark's Finger where it is rumored that strange beasts live, and a trail
to the south east of the entrance to this city, there are some very
dangerous creatures there.  You mustn't cross the river which the trail
runs into.

When you are ready for adventuring I would suggest you leave the city and
head north on the trail, and then at the first branch in the trail you
come to, head eastward.  Also, after killing something try to @bskin@n

regard you maliciously.~
A small, hateful creature crouches in the darkness before you.  The size
of a small gnome, its twisted form is a flat black hue, its white pupils
blank and expressionless.  The only sound you hear is the incessant,
rhythmical scraping of serrated claws against one another in a slow,
hypnotic motion.

This massive woodworm is over two meters long and almost a meter high. 
His massive elongated body is covered by several large plates forming a
tough exoskeleton.  Dwarfed by his massive body are his short spear-like
legs that are barbed at the ends to facilitate climbing inside a dead
tree.  Around his mouth several large mandibles can be seen, obviously

Sir Herroldus's favorite mount use to be a copper dragon.  He said there
was none to match it in power.
~
E
stat2~
One of the first mounts a paladin calls to aid them is a trained war
stallion.  It's just a little more trained than a heavy war horse.  Sir
Walltier use to carry a battle standard with him on this mount all the
time.
~
E
stat3~
After his griffon died, Sir Walltier chose to fight with a pegasus at his
side.

Aside from his copper dragon, Sir Heralldus most faithful companion was
his spirit horse.  It never failed him, not even in death, he use to
brag.

Though a fiersome and loyal mount, the androsphinx is rumored to be
tempermental.  Sir Jerrvus use to run with one, but I hear that he
preferred the hyperactive and giddy hippocampus more, even though it was

Though not as powerful as his griffon, Sir Walltier use to regale me with

Several lockes of dark-brown hair cascade softly over the high forehead
of this elegantly slender llewyrr woman.  Woven into one of these locks
of hair are several painted stone and wood beads.  You also notice that
tied to the end of the longest lock of hair are several large feathers.
This woman holds herself in a humble yet elegant way, as if she has
greater purpose to her life, as if she has found meaning here.

history3~
Gradually...things...changed.  At first we didn't notice it much, being
wrapped up in the construction of the great stone walls around Pennan
that would make our small village secure for all time.  We even hoped
that one day our village would move beyond being an appendage to Chiiron,
and join the ranks of the greatest cities of the realm.  This was, alas,
not to be.  Slowly but surely, the trade routes which meet at Pennan
withered and died, like a great plant whose roots find only rocky soil.
~
E
history2~
In the days of my youth, this valley was a fine center of agriculture
and trade.  Standing along the great trade route between Narak, Medienne
and Orlumber, Pennan was a fine place to be.  The great caravans would
crisscross the Valley Road like so many ants at work in their tunnels,
always busy and always with something to do and somewhere to go.
~
E
history1~
Your question may seem simple to you, but a great many things are tied in
with this valley, and none of them are so clear cut as we would like
ourselves to believe.

The old hag chuckles.
~
E
dark~
Her face darkens, and the pace of Gwendolyn's speech slows.
~
E
hist4~
The great caravans no longer reached Pennan, and the Gnomes of Orlumber
sent word that their city faced great troubles of their own, troubles
which precluded further contact with 'the larger folk.' As trade dried
up, so too did the funds for our wall, and our leaders' grand illusion. 
Now, with our great fortifications incomplete and crumbled by the
elements, it seems as if we cannot protect ourselves from even the
smallest menaces..Each day, the raiders grow bolder, and our warders more
weary.

Today...things continue to deteriorate.  The hills surrounding Pennan are

Pennan itself has been attacked on numerous occasions, by small, strange
figures who steal into the village at night and set fire to our homes and
fields.  These raiders must be stopped...yet my finest men have been
unable to track them back to their lair.

Look about you, and observe, for Pennan was not always as it appears
today.  Once, the Rua Valley was known through the lands of humanity as a
prosperous center of trade and agriculture alike.  Individuals of all
races would cross paths here, at the small square only a few strides from
where we now stand.  Yet...things somehow changed.  I know not the exact
details, those were events of my father's lifetime, and of his father's
time before him.  Ask the sage, or Gwendolyn, if such things suit
you...I'm not one to dwell in the past.

He scowls.  "They make life impossible.  Every day it seems one of my
animals disappears, or turns up cut to shreds in some secluded area of
the hills, or along the roads.  Bennis even said he saw a few of the
little bastards inside Pennan the other night.  Something's got to happen
soon.  Maybe you could talk to Corahnin; I know his warders are searching
high and low for the blasted raiders, but they're just spread too thin to
be effective.

Please, do something, before an honest shepherd loses what remains of his
flock."

That is the history of the Shuvanaguard as all know it.  There is little
more to tell.  Only that they know their own, and that they carry their
badge of kinship, a finely crafted sword that is their honor.
~
E
guard4~
In the centuries since its inception, the Guard has grown and changed as
all things must.  When we first learned of dwarves and humans we had our
troubles.  Treat them as all other visitors who had thus far come to our
land or grant them the same trust we initially granted those firstcomers
who did so much harm to our precious woods?  Even now there are some who
would close our borders to them in hopes of repairing the inestimable
damage that remains.  Yet the Guard still grows, and a handful of humans
has joined its number, aye, even a dwarf wears the name.  Many see that
alone as a sign of the new changewinds, ones that blow our fortune in the
guise of integration.
~
E
guard3~
First we were to learn of the violence inherent to the baser races, the
orcs, ogres, goblins and their ilk.  We tried to befriend them, bring
them into the harmony of the world, but they rebelled calling us weak
slaves chained to philosophies weaker than the grass upon which we stand. 
It was in those days that the Shuvanaguard was first formed to protect
the Vaasa from their vile encroachment.  Not to slaughter our foes with
the senseless brutality they brought to our lands, but to repell them
with wisdom and righteous strength.
~
E
guard2~
Then it all ended as the changewinds brought the stench of carnage, of
brutal, senseless death.
~
E
guard~
Long, long ago we elves lived in peace knowing complete harmony with our
homeland here in the Vaasa.  The peace was total and complete and our
lives very fulfilling.  An elf could spend an age merely contemplating a
change or perfecting a craft.  The land itself was at peace.

The making of the blades requires much.  Foremost among these is the

unsullied water of the earth touched by the stars.  Bring to me the

E
step1~
The high druid places both ingots of steel upon the stone alter.
~
E
step2~
From within the folds of his robes he pulls forth a small ritual hammer
and several packets of herbs.
~
E
step3~
He looks about for something he seems to have misplaced.  When he sees
you are still holding the starwater, he motions for you to hand it to him
and you comply.
~
E
step4~
The high druid closes his eyes, and for a while even the forest seems to
join in silence with him.
~
E
step5~
@bSuddenly his eyes snap open and he begins chanting strange, liquid words
in a mellifluous voice.@n
~
E
step7~
@CHe reaches forth in the midst of his chant and tosses the herbs over
the ingots.  Before your eyes they seem to sizzle and melt into a single
glowing mass.@n
~
E
step8~
@CHis voice seems to grow deeper as the chanting continues.  He reaches
forth and strikes the mass with the hammer and it begins to glow faintly,
slowly taking the shape of a sword.@n
~
E
step9~
He steps back from the altar and his voice grows deeper still and seems
to resonate throughout the forest.  You begin to feel an odd build up of
power and step back several paces yourself.
~
E
step10~
Then as suddenly as he started, the high druid ceases his chant and
silence reigns supreme.  
~
E
KABOOM~
@MKAAAABOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!@n a searing bolt of lightning crashes upon the
altar emanating from a cloudless sky.
~
E
step12~
Temporarily blinded by the bright flare of light, you only hear the
sizzle of water striking hot metal as the high druid pours the starwater
over the sword.
~
E
step13~
When you can see again, a gleaming sword rests upon the altar in all its
glory.  The high druid picks up the sword, and presses its sharp tip lightly
against your chest.
~
E
step14~
He speaks, his voice somewhat raw from the incantations, saying "By your
word and deed you have accepted the duties of the Shuvanaguard.  You are
charged by your honor to fulfill those duties.  Go forth, and bear your
honor brightly member of the Shuvanaguard".  So saying, he reverses the

E
whistle~
Tiercen looks skyward and lets out a shrill whistle.  High overhead a
hawk wheels off its intended course, circles twice, and breaks off
sharply southward.
~
E
patience~
Tiercen smiles thinly and nods his head a few times, softly speaking to
himself in such a way that you can not understand the words.  You manage
to catch only a fragment, something about "...get here soon".
~
E
waiting~
Tiercen hold up a hand motioning you to wait patiently.
~
E
glance~
Tiercen peers off into the deep forest, seems to find what he's looking
for and motions something over.
~
E
fairy~
A glittering light bobs its way through the forest, followed by another,
then another.  Suddenly you notice a swarm of glittering little lights
merrily flitting their way through the forest to this clearing.
~
E
fairy2~
The swarm of fairies, easily identifiable once they clear the woods, fill
the clearing.  After a few sounds like bells chiming (fairy talk
perhaps?) they coalesce into a whirlwind of light swirling around each
person in the clearing one at a time.
~
E
rbegone~
Tiercen points at $n and loudly intones "@GBegone fould despoiler of my
people@n"!
~
E
left~
$n is surrounded by a whirlwind of glittering dairy lights.  When they
disperse you see that $n is no longer there.
~
E
leaving~
A whirlind of glittering fairy lights surrounded you, their chiming
voices like the ringing of bells.  When you finally get them to disperse,
you realize you are no longer in the clearing.
~
E
arrive~
A glowing whirlwind of glittering lights begins to coalesce, becomes
nearly blinding, then suddenly winks out of existence leaving $n looking
dazed where the lights had been.
~
E
begone~
Tiercen points at you and loudly intones
"@GBegone foul despoiler of my people!@n"

~
E
ok~
Tiercen looks about briefly and says, " My appologies for the wait, I
just don't take well to people carrying about bits of my deceased cousins. 
I imagine it will be a while before the ufortunate soul the fairies took
off returns.  Perhaps they will think better of their accoutrements
before returning.

Now, how can I help you?"

But you have already joined the Shuvanaguard $n.  What more would you

to join the Shuvanaguard perhaps I could tell you a little about the
swords they carry that are the badge of their success?"

later~
Ah, 'tis a noble group of defenders you ask to join, but I can tell you
they would have you learn more of the world first.  Go forth and

wealthy-looking~
are here, playing dice.~
Dressed in finely tailored clothes, this gambler is wrapped up in a game
of dice.  Before every toss of the dice he blows on them and whispers
something to them and closes his eyes as he whips them against the wall. 
His eyes are dead-locked on his game and seems to be unaware of anything
around him except for his current game.

Before you stands the elusive fade, a creature of myth and magic.  The

blending in perfectly with the mists of its hunting grounds, it is
equally feared for its brutal hunting prowess.  Most worrisome of all is
the rumor that it is a creature of some forgotten magic that can turn
itself to mist at will.

Shrouded in dark robes and shadows, this priest of Morr is a mystery like
the god himself.  His robes conceal all of his features and only a pair
of glowing red eyes can be seen from beneath his hood.  Peering closely
you notice that his hand is not normal, but like that of a skeleton,
completely stripped of flesh and showing only bleached-white bone.  He
quietly chants dark prayers, asking Morr for guidance and wisdom.

This drunken shell of a man does not seem particularly aware of his
surroundings.  His bloodshot eyes meet yours as you look upon him, and
for a moment he approaches lucidity.  Quick as it came, the moment
passes, and he resumes sinnging a rather crude tune.

lie in wait of a meal.~
The creature's most noticeable feature is the set of huge mandibles that
it swings in your direction.  Behind them you see four sets of alien eyes
set on its large armored head.  As it quests about with its body, feeling
around the room in search of food, you realize that its eyes are too poor
to see you.  You get a shiver in you spine, however, as you realize the
food he searches for is you.  Thick plates of chitin and spiny bristles
protect its body, and its powerful, short legs hold it in a low wide
stance.  It clacks its mandibles fiercely and charges toward you in a
berserker rage.

Murk beasts are usually passive, docile bottom-dwellers of marshes and
swamps and other murky places.  When hungry or provoked, however, a murk
beast can be a ferocious attacker.  Adult murk beasts can grow to about 7
tons in weight.  Their protective grey murk-like covering camouflages
them so well that they appear to be simply another patch of marsh or grey
rock.

The lion, the proverbial king of the jungle, is seldom found in the dense
tropical regions fabled to be his home.  More often found romping amongst
the highly game-populated areas of the plains, these ferocious and
ravenous hunters are dangerous foes, with claws which can rip a man into
shreds and a powerful jaw which can chew a man in half.  As they age,
however, their skills diminish somewhat, and this beast is no exception,
which accounts for his choice of this cool cave and easier prey in this
desert area.

For a high price, I once tended the wounds of a half-orc that lived

in an alley.  You must find out what happening to the citizens, and find
a way to keep it from happening again or reoccurring.

You might be interested in knowin' this.  A while back, before his home
was destroyed, a mage of some small power lived in the north part of the
town.  I'm sure the place has been ransacked, but you never know what you
might find.  Of course, I'll be expecting my fair share.
~
E
rumor~
Hmmph!  A single gold.  That doesn't buy you much these days.  But I hear
from some of the denizens of the desert that there is something strange
going on within its confines.  Something about a Dragonne waiting to
enter a forbidden place.

Small in stature, and lacking in the pure brute force of an ogre, this

his teeth are half rotted out.  Even a mother would have a tough time

A man dressed in rags stands here.  His face is dominated by a large nose
that resemble the beak of a parrot.  Two beady black eyes peer at you
from under a heavy brow, like a bird looking at a worm.  His peeling lips
are dry and chapped, As they curl back to form a gruesome leer, row after
row of teeth become visible.  They look like giant yellowing thorns, ones
at the outer most edge of his mouth are the largest.  Even though the
teeth decrease in size as they retreat into the depths of his mouth, you
do not think they are any less sharp.

Well, it seems I no longer have the necessary writing implement.  If you

Prenslie recites a short incantation and the candles around his desk
ignite, providing more than ample light to the area.

Next he pulls a hand-sized hexagonal crystal from a pocket and begins
examining the parchment through it.  On three occassions he moves the
crystal aside and runs his hand over patches of the parchment reciting an
incantation under his breath.
~
E
wait~
Finally, satisfied with the parchment, he puts away his crystal and picks
up the quill.  He sits in silent meditation for a moment, then with a
start, dips the quill into the phial of crimson ink and begins writing. 
You can just hear a non-stop series of incantations being subvocalized
under his breath while he writes.
~
E
now!~
Finally, after several minutes of subvocalized chanting and scribing,
Prenslie lays the feathered quill down and rubs his hands to work out the
kinks.  He stands and hands you the now completed scroll.  "To an
adventurer such as yourself, who comes in contact with various and
sundry items, this scroll, used to remove all cursed items from you,
should be of some use.  I hope it serves you well." he says.

Ah, metallic dragons are among the easiest creatures to summon to your

E
stat1~
Hamadryads are female spirits of the forest, whose spirit lies within the
heart of a great tree.  She lives only so long as the tree does. 
Typically, hamadryad spirits center around oak trees.
~
E
stat2~
Hamadaryds live in much the same fashion but are male spirits of the
forest.  While a hamadryad lures away and kill young men would would harm
their forest, hamadaryds do the same thing to female trespassers.  Like a
hamadryad, a hamadaryd's spirit resides within a special tree. 
Hamadaryds though have only been known to center around pine trees.

You know, I can't remember what summons a crystal simulcrum to be a

advance toward you.~
Some souls are brought back by powerful magics to do the bidding of their
summoning master, be he good or evil, they have no choice.  Others are
tied to this plane by oath, or by curse.  This short spectre boasts
a massive frame which, although it may not be as mighty as it was in
life, certainly remains firm and as sturdy as a trunk.  What the being
desires is anything but clear, but your presence obviously is unwanted.

A stern-looking elf glances at you as you arrive, but continues stitching

his attitude and the scars he bears betray a full life spent in the

Aside from a rather large set of feathered wings, this appears to be

deadly looking hooves.  The wings are the pure white of the undriven snow
and look as soft as down.

Although looking mostly human, a primal glow of red lurks behind this

This monstrosity is a creature out of nightmare -- oozing saps and

impossible to tell where the creature ends and the vines of the cave
begin.  This creature could very well be the deciding element in any

by a unknown number of guards.  In his chamber lies the puzzle which
involves a set of runes that you must set into the right combination to

A relatively small, meaning no larger than a full grown elephant, dragon
seems to have had the misfortune of dieing in the presence of a
necromancer.  That can be the only explanation for the frightful beast
before you.  Sickly yellow-green scales glimmer dully in the surrounding
dimness.  Jagged claws the size of shortswords tip most, but not all of
its immense toes.  Despite being dead, it still looks a fearsome foe.

Devoid of flesh and blood, devoid of life and breath, this beast yet
remains a frightful sight.  Though most are cracked, and a few are
missing, enough sword-sharp claws remain to provide a prominent threat. 
A bone-white rib cage large enough to fit inside, remains completely
intact, adding to a sense of sheer size.  In life, this may have only
been a dragon no larger than an elephant, but in death its size seems
irrelevant.

position themselves before you.~
This giant figure towers before you, enormous muscles flexed in a show
of stark challenge.  Hair cropped short above one large eye set in the
middle of his forehead, the giant regards you in the strange sight of a
cyclops.  Judging from his aggressive posture, you doubt he will simply
stand there for long.

This cyclops is HUGE.  Although he does not quite discern your movements
with the acute vision of most two-eyed humanoids, his central eye does
not merely look at the visible.  He stands at 20 feet in height and at
least half that as wide.  Truly a beast of a specimen.

Although not quite as large as some of the other cyclops of his clan,
this particular cyclops possesses a rare thing about his race; an
aptitude for magic.  Thus, he serves as his clan's shaman, mostly a
position of superstition and tradition.  His eye has grown dark and
sinister, and he looks to be a quite powerful denizen of evil.

@RLefty@n, the proprietor of this dingy shop, is a prime example of how
crime does not always pay.  His right hand has been cut off at the wrist,
and he still has a pallor associated with a long stay in prison.  He is
quite talkative, and loves to tell folks about his days as a master
thief: days before the Wizard came into power.

my blessing.

the brazier remains somewhere near voaleth and has not seen sunlight yet. 
Should it see sunlight, it could ruin it and make it unusable.  Take care

world.  Should you wish to know how to survive here, just ask.  In fact,
you can just type @bask troll advice@n, and I will give you some valuable
information.
~

There are a number of useful help files which you should read, first and
foremost would be to type @bhelp newbie@n.  Within this town are several
useful shops where you can buy equipment, as well as practice your basic
skills and spells.  When you are ready to venture forth from here, to the
far east within the cavern walls lie some creatures against which you can
try out your luck...  er, skills.

One important thing to remember is that you can often @btell@n an NPC

and give you some helpful information.  You can also @bask@n those same
characters about specific things, just as you have asked me for some
advice.
~
E
introduce~
When you first arrived here in town, you didn't know a soul.  When you
look at others, you can only see their @bappearance@n, and that is all
they see when you pass them by as well.  In order to know them by name,
you must @bintroduce@n yourself to them in a language they understand. 
To do so, type @bintroduce <target person>@n.  You may need to switch to
their language by typing @blang theirlanguage@n, assuming that you in
fact know their language.  As you become friendly with your
acquaintances, you may wish to @bbefriend@n them, so that they are able
to help you get your corpse should you die.  For a friendly cleric to
summon you, you will need to @bconsent@n them.
~
E
advice2~
I can give you advice on any of the following topics: @bweapons, spells,
armor, pets, food and drink, chat and gossip and other communications,
noteboard, skills, practices@n, and general @badventuring@n advice. 
Simply ask @btroll <topic>@n for information about that topic.

about current events.  Often @btaverns@n are especially good places to

I see you have chosen the inner path.  The way of the monk is not the way

advise you to visit your spiritual leader in a place quite close to here. 
He will gladly train you in many of your basic skills if you go and
@bpractice@n with him.  The gentleman who sells weapons here in town can
also provide some general skills, as well as several other citizens of
this town.
~
E
ranger~
Ah, noble friend of the woods.  Scout, forager, guide.  All this you are
and more, friend ranger.  You will face many trails alone in your travels. 
I would advise you begin your training while here in town.  You can learn
much from the local mage, priest, and weapon trainer.  All of them would
be glad to train you if you will just go and '@bpractice@n' with them. 
When you visit the weapon trainer, I would also advice buying a weapon
from him to defend youself in the wilds.
~
E
paladin~
Ah, I see you have chosen to follow the path of the holy warrior.  As a
paladin you will be tried by both the forces of good and evil.  If you
are to succeed in your holy vows you would do best to seek training from
the priest in the temple and the weapon trainer would be able to be of
great service to you.  Both would be eager to train you if you were to
'@bpractice@n' with them.  You would be well advised to buy a weapon from
the weapon trainer while you are there.  His shop is just east of here.

E
other~
I see you know nothing of the magical or clerical arts, so you should

also explore the rest of the town - there are many places of interest,
and other folks can teach you useful skills.
~
E
mage~
I see you are a mage.  The first thing you should know is that Larblad,
the magic shop owner, teaches spells.  Before you leave town, you should
find the weaponsmith and purchase a staff or dagger.  Without it, you
will have little chance.  Type 'abil spell' to find out what spells you
have.  If you want Larblad to train you, the command to know is
'@bpractice@n.' 
~
E
cleric~
I see you are a cleric.  A wise choice.  If you want to learn spells, go
to the temple and find the priest.  He can teach you if you go there and
'@bpractice@n'.  Before you leave town, you should find the weaponsmith 
and purchase a club or staff.

There is no one single place to learn all skills or spells.  The world is
a large place, and it your job to seek out the various beings who can
teach you the skills you would like to learn.  Fortunately, several of
the locals can teach you the basic skills you'll need to survive.  The
more advanced things you'll need to seek out on your own.
~
E
prac3~
To see if someone can teach you any spells or skills, simply type
'practice'.  If someone is in the room who can train you, you will be
shown a list of what you can learn, how many practices it will cost to
learn the skill, and how many coppers the teacher will require to train
you.  To practice a skill type 'practice <skill name>'.

For weapons training, you should see the orc Wellburn, who lives in the
southwest part of town.  Though now retired, he was once a great warrior
and should be able to teach you a few things.
~
E
prac3~
There are many who might teach you magic, though a good place to start is
at the shop of Larblad.  His few teachings should start you on your way. 
But be warned, for both weapons and magic you have only a limited ability
to practice, so choose wisely.

notes~
A lot of the people in the realm like to leave notes for others to read. 
They have found the use of several different noteboards to be very
effective, as not everyone has the time to meet and talk about the goings
on of the world all day long.  Anyone can use the noteboards with only a
little training (@bhelp notes@n).

drink~
The fountain in Voaleth provides ample water.  You can @bdrink@n from it
(@bdrink fountain@n) or even @brefill@n your drinking containers in it. 
In the wilds, it is also possible to drink from the streams and rivers. 
It is a good idea to have some sort of drinking container with you if you
are leaving town.  A waterskin works well as it holds much more than a
cup does.
~
E
eat~
You can buy food from 'Food and Furs' in the center of town, as well as
several of the local taverns.  However, many people find it more
convenient to go hunt for their meals.  Rabbits and other wild animals
provide good sources of food.  Just to the east of town you will find an
area with some animals that can provide you with tasty food.  Just be
careful not to stuff your mouth too quickly, for once you are full, the
extra food will be wasted.  When you can't eat but are hungry, make sure
you are eating only one thing.

~
E

You ask the aged troll about chatting and gossiping.
~
E
chats~
Players have the ability to comunicate over the vast distances of the
realm using the various chat channels.  To limit the abuse of over using
them, players accrue something called gossip points, which are spent when
you use the various gossip channels.  The channels are @bChat@n (1 point
per use), @bGossip@n (10 points per use), @bAuction@n (1 points per use),
and @bShout@n (100 points per use).  You can toggle the channels on/off by
simply typing their name (except for shout which is always on) or
communicate over them by typing @b<Channel Name> <what you want to say>@n.
Gossip points are accrued simply by being here, the longer you are here,
the more you will have.
~
E

$N looks at you.

Keep in mind that there are folks from many different races in this world. 
You need to speak their language to communicate with them through @bsay@n
or to introduce to them.  If you are grouped with them, you can use
@bgroup tell@n and they will understand you no matter what language you
speak.

You should probably consider purchasing some armor from Gerflak.  You
should be able to find him just a bit north on the opposite side of the
street.
~
E

When you buy the armor you should put it on by wearing it.  Be careful
you do not try to put too much on at once.  You could @bwear@n a @bbracer@n,
but not both bracers on the same arm.  If you are truly in a hurry I
suggest you just @bwear all@n of it at once.

Ah, companion of the woods, to you the animals are more than pets are
they not?  They a friends who will fight at your side.  Others will go to
shops in the towns where people have trained animals to obey, you also
may do this.  For you there also exists the knowledge that you may one
day learn to charm the animals with your woodland magic and they will
travel with you willingly.  Both the trained pets of the shops, and the
freer animals you may meet, can be a boon in a fight for you life, as
they may aid you (use 'option pet_assist').  Be warned, it takes time to
control a pet the number and strength of the pets you control wlil be
limited by your experience in this world.  However, all of your pets will
obey your '@border@n'.  Thus if you '@border wolf sit@n' it will do
so until ordered otherwise.  If you lose your pets, simply @bwhistle@n. 
Provided they are near by and are not asleep, they will slowly try to
find you.
~
E
other~
I have fond memories of pets over the many years.  They have given me
comfort, joy, and often times even save my life in combat.  There are
shops in some towns where pets are tamed and trained to be of assistance. 
Once purchased they will follow you loyally obeying what you '@border@n'
them to do.  If you '@border dog sit@n' he will do so until you command
him otherwise.  In combat pets may assist you (use 'option pet_assist')
even to their death.  They wil remain loyal until they die, or until you
release them (see 'help pet').  Be warned, it takes time to learn to
control your pet and they wil be limited in size by your experience in
this world.  Should you ever lose your pets, simply @bwhistle@n. 
Provided they are near by and are not asleep, they will slowly try to

When ready to adventure, you should enter the the underground areas to

your new skills and spells on, but be sure to @bconsider@b them first,
for some are more dangerous than others.  When you have gained a few
levels try more challenging creatures and possibly even leave the city
and its caverns on your adventures.  If the gate is closed when you
return, @bpound@n on it and the guards should let you back in.  If they
are closed and you need out of the city, simply @bpull lever@n to open
the gate.  If you kill a creature, you may want to @bskin@b it.  If you
are able to skin it successfully, bring the skin back to town and sell it
in 'Food and Furs' in the central part of town.  Skinning these same
animals may also provide a source of food.  Good luck on your journeys.

To be honest, I'm not really sure what paladins use to call their mounts. 
Their guard this secret quite closely.  Nonetheless, like all spells of

the essence of the mount will have more success than something that does
not.

Now that I think about it, I do know of a couple of reagents that

Bent with age, this boatman might be a hundred years old.  At one time he

skin is as dark as rich soil, his hands are callused like treebark.  His
left eye is milk-white, and remains totally still while his other - as
blue as cloudless day - looks around keenly.

face.  Her fingers and arms are grotesquely long, her mouth is twisted in

What a strange little creature.  It appears quite humanoid in nature,
though it is no larger than a gnome. Its mottled brownish skin hangs in
loose sags in many places.  Where the the loose skin is pulled tighter,
such as at its arms, you can see it has very underdeveloped muscle
structure.  It takes a moment to glance at you with its oversized, pale
eyes then goes about its business with complete disinterest.

Generally the tallest of its kind, this troglodyte stands about as tall

pale eyes are the only thing in its face resembling the other troglodytes. 
Where other troglodytes have a forward sloping skull and nearly frog-like
face, this one's face is nearly completely flat.  Its skin is heavily
painted in swirling, runic patterns with brilliant red, blue, and
phosphorescent green dyes.

@MAh, this fine old city.  Its ancient creators long since perished,

beasts, and a horde of fine treasures.  Taking my rightful place as their

cracked teeth, and in exchange, they revere me.  It was only natural that
I assume my position as rightful owner of this ancient dwelling and all

Standing before you is a VERY large orc covered in tattos.  His body is
very muscular and lean giving the impression that he is no apprentice
warrior.  Various tattoos cover his body but one in particular catches
your eye.  The tattoo sits just above his right eye and is that of a
warlord's mark.  Scars cover most of his body as do some fresh wounds
that have been poorly bandaged.  He stares down onto the table before him
at a map of the area and seems to be in deep concentration.

vyan librarians~

are here, discussing the literary merits of various writers.~
Tsarith is tall for a vyan, standing nearly five and a half feet tall
from head to toe.  His skin is as black as a starless sky, and his short
hair the color of the ashes found in a cold firepit.  He is dressed in
dark, elegant clothes trimmed in silver and white.  Though his dark eyes
and neutral expression seem to hold no warmth for you, neither do they
seem set to drive you away.

You are welcome to look through my library, so long as you treat the
books with respect.  Feel free to borrow them, but don't even think of
trying to steal them away.  I have them all enspelled such that they will
always return to me.  Feel free to @bbrowse@n about and see if you find
anything interesting.

lib~
I have collected all the books in this library through years of travel. 
I have yet to glean all the knowledge from them, yet I know that herein
are contained secrets awaiting discovery.  Only through the garnering and
understanding of knowledge will we overcome those that plague us.  By
sharing my knowledge with the like-minded individuals that come to this
city, I encourage them to share knowledge with me.  Once I have found the
answers I seek, I will return outside and cleanse the world of those that
have ired me.

Wisdom and knowledge can only be found through study and experience.  You

Despite its size, this creature is difficult to see against a snowy

covered in a thick white fur, and two white, bat-like wings sprout from
it's back, the membranes a light, rosy pink.  It's eyes and talons are,
by contrast, black as coal, the claws the size of cutlasses, its bared
teeth far too reminiscent of sharpened blades.

This tall, slender, muscular female is amazing beautiful.  Her long
coppery hair flows down her back where it ends in a tightly-braided
ponytail.  Her amber eyes convey a look of compassion but also tell the
story of a veteran fighter who would not hesitate a moment to defender
her home against invaders.  Her large muscles are finely toned, testament
to the training a woman of her kind must go through to become a guard of
the capital city.

The sorceress looks at you gravely.  You hear her soft, golden voice
echoing in the vaults of your mind.  "You speak of serious things, mortal. 
We faeriefolk have dwelt here for centuries, our lives formed around
guarding this forest and to ensure the dark prison behind me remains
sealed.  Lately, I fear, my magic has grown weaker, and the foul evil
behind this stormy wall has grown stronger.  I know not whether I will be
able to keep it sealed much longer."

drove back the dragon and sealed it in a magic prison.  'Course that's
all just a story."

Unlike most of its race who try to pass themselves as darkly colored
lizardmen, this particular serpentman seems to flaunt his serpentine
heritage.  His dark brown and black scales are buffed and shined and his
claws look to be freshly sharpened.  Dressed in loose fitting garments
suited for living in the desert, the serpentman looks harmless enough and
in fact, quite eager.  Something about his constantly shifting eyes

Thalor stands a bit shorter than most elves, topping at roughly four and
a half feet.  Though shorter than most adult elves you've seen, he
displays all of their natural fluid grace and dexterity.  His sandy-blond
hair is cut short, appearantly an influence from outside the Vaasa,
though he retains a single befeathered and beaded braid in remembrance of
long gone friends.  He seems somewhat on guard as he studies you with his

The serf winces, as she remembers the great evil.
~
E
history~
I was captured and put to work here in the kitchens five years ago.  The
tyrant that conquered Voaleth sends out annual raiding parties, as you
know, to replenish his slaves.  The evil he has brought, and the cruelty
performed by the Watchers, far surpasses the evils of the traditional
rulers of the city.
~
E
whisper~
You see the serf talk quietly to $n.
~
E
careful~
A @bvery@n careful person could vanquish him, and bring back our
traditional town.  I know that I would be very grateful, as would all of
the people of the town.  You can find him usually hidden away somewhere
in the palace, for he fears greatly for his safety.
~
E
waiting~
That's all i really can tell you.  Can't you help me in some way?

Wisps of silver fog twine and gather, taking on a form that seems human. 
A slender woman, delicately formed, with a thick corona of hair that
still hints at its living color, a soft red-gold.  Her eyes are large
and fixed with great intensity.  Her lips are full and likewise tinted
with a trace of color, so alive in their aspect that one could almost
imagine a human breath passing through them, and a heartbeat behind it. 
She wears a long gown of what must have been a fine wool, pale in color,
the folds shifting slowly as if in a breeze...  sometimes white,
sometimes showing thin tendrils of red running down between the folds,
and a scarlet stain just where the heart would be.

Wisps of chill, frozen mist roll and tumble here, taking on a form that

mouth is grim and closed in a thin line of suppressed emotion, his eyes
so alive in their aspect and self-loathing that you can almost hear his
voice.  The ghostly image is garbed in faint reflections of a guard's
armor, and he holds a spectral sword in his hand, the blade colored a

Garbed in a burial shroud, the lich @b@RRathika@n wails at your intrusion.~

Once a powerful priestess for the god Morkith, Rathika has risen from her
grave to complete her takes of freeing her god.  Blood-covered burial
shrouds cover most of her body except for her hands which bits of flesh
still hang from her boney fingers.  Her eyes are nothing more than mere
red pin-points which seem to burn with a hatred for all life.  Her
stringy grey hair is quite sparce and bits of it occasionally fall from
her head and onto the ground.  Even in undeath, Rathika seems to be a
formidable opponent to all who dare challenge her.

a vampires and his blood-red eyes seem to pierce your soul with his icy
glance.  His figure is quite slim, as if not of this living earth but
rather of the undead.

So newly hatched it this young condor that its feathers are still a bit

Little more than a foot tall, the baby condor looks to be all wings and

{small reptiles} small cactus lizards~

hiss violently here, baring their needle-sharp teeth.~
Little more than a foot long, excluding its lengthy tail, this lizard
stands no more than four inches tall.  Its leathery skin is covered with
minuscule, interlocking green scales that vary in size and shape down the
length of its body.  Much like a cactus, the lizard has prickly barbs
protruding from its body, running down the center of its spine and tail. 
Two inch-long horns jut out from the lizard's head, making it look fierce
despite its lack of size.

This creature stands as tall as an elf, but that is where any resemblance
ends.  Sallow skin hangs in loose folds under its chin and arms.  Long,
thick nails sticking out from its stubby fingers look appalingly like
claws.  Though it does appear to notice your presence, it seems to be
waiting most humbly for a command from its master, its pale eyes cast
downward.

This mpcode is intended to prevent anyone attacking the sacrificial trog
before he can kill himself.  The sacrifice is cool, but tends to make
this mob worth about 80-101k experience.  Way too much.  Just whacking
him before he gets sacrificed tends to earn people 5-12k exp, and they've
taken no damage for it.  Too much for about 1-2 rounds of combat with no
threat of getting killed.  -Talis

in midair, impacting with the shield and flatly bouncing off ; he appears
unaffected by the cold about him.  In addition, elements of cold whirl
about him in a frenzy; he treats his frosty subjects as servants for his

@b@WWelcome to what was once the fine land of Tarik Nor, now as you have
probably seen is nothing more than a bunch of sand, dead trees and the
occasional vulture.@n 
~
E
2~
@b@WYou see it all started when the Arch Mage Tarkath decided he was
bored with traditional magic and decide he wanted to be the center of
attention and devised a plot to open several astral gates to the outer
planes.  This however failed miserably and Tarkath wound up opening a
gate to the Abyss and Nine Hells and before we knew it an army of demons
came rushing through the gates and attacked everything in their path.@n

~
E
3~
@b@WI was part of the finest Dwarven Berserker brigade in the land, the
Skull Crackers.  We rallied our forces and attempted to hold back the
demons but everyone but me died trying to defend our home.  Soon the land
was thrown into a war that lasted over 500 years and those who survived
wished for death as their homeland become nothing more then rubble, but
the demons were wise.  They cast a spell on the land giving everyone in
it immortality so they could live forever, tormented with the deaths of
their lost friends and loved ones.@n 
~
E

@b@WI cannot die and rejoin my clan and thus i stay here, warning newcomers
of the dangers.  It would be wise to leave this place as the monsters
here are fiercer then a hoard of dragons combined.  But if you wish to
continue on I wish you luck my friend.@n

@b@WTarkath was not a cruel man, he was simply..well...dumb.  He was
never a good a mage as the others but none the less received the title of
Arch Mage.  He was always lusting for new spells and magic items to
further his power but never once turned his power towards evil until he
opened the gates.  He lived in the capital city a bit northwest of here
called Morindale, a fine city.@n
~
E
tell1~
@b@WNo one knew if he survived the great war but many people said they
saw him battling a huge black demon atop the castle battlements one day
but other than that we know nothing more.  If he survived he is the only
man that can help bring an end to the evil here.  Seek him there if he
still lives, perhaps he can help you, perhaps even help us all lift this

with a hint of forgotten gaiety stand before you.~
Standing before you is a rare and elusive wild elf.  Her auburn hair
falls in waves down to the small of her back and her skin is of a light
chestnut hue.  She stands an impressive five foot one inch tall with a
slightly fragile build.  No visual scars mar her perfect chestnut brown
skin, though a tattoo of runes encircles her left eye.  These religious
runes draw you into dark brown eyes that seem alight with pure
malevolance.  Where once there may have been a loving smile now lies a
twisted mischevioius grin.  She moves with a fluidity that bespeaks a
dancer, though it is quite evident that she rarley performs dances of
joy, but instead prefers the macabre dance of death.

face seems to dance at the light of flame.  Small glasses dot his nose,

This squat old woman's eyes are the first thing that grabs your attention. 
Although her aging looks and gnomish manner make her look meek, dark-blue
orbs glare at you silently, and you feel as if they could freeze a dragon
in its tracks.  As if the thought 'freeze' came into your head, you
notice that the room has gotten considerably colder since you stepped in,
and this woman seems to be causing it, as you notice her mumbling a
series of unrecognizable words, probably a spell.

This graying old adept may look ancient, but there is a step of life in

as if he has just discovered the meaning of life, and is frantically
searching for a book.  Small blue sparks of electrical energy fly from

This short alchemist is working several things at once.  Holding a beaker
of some volatile substance in one hand, he checks on a series of glass
tubing that is leading a yellow liquid to a small flask containing a
purple liquid.  Squinty-eyed, he pours the beaker into the small flask,
and a huge cloud of bluish smoke erupts from the container.  Grinning
eagerly, he has a childish light to his eyes, and as he walks back to a
small store of ingredients on a nearby shelf, you realize that he is
simultaneously incanting a spell, just barely audible from the din of the
smoking flask.

Enshrouded from head to foot in a black-hooded cloak, the necromancer has

A billowing, swelling mass of darkness floats here, nearly engulfing the

Wearing a suit of what once must have been princely armor, the spectre

darkness once more.

The scales of this desert serpent still glisten from hatching.  Already
half the length of your arm, the viper is clearly large to have just
emerged from its egg.  The fang-bearing bone on each side of the upper
jaw not only is much shorter than in most other snakes but looks thicker
too.  An alternating pattern of triangles undulates down from the viper's
head to its tail in shades of pale orange and tan.  Though just a baby,
the fangs of the viper look nonetheless deadly.

It is unclear what this large and shaggy beast truly is.  It looks to be
a cross between an extremely large moorhound and a grizzly bear.  The
creature has muscular fore arms and hind legs, each of which end in wide,
flat paws.  Six-inch, curved nails protrude from each paw, some of which
are covered with a rust-colored substance.  While its body is grossly
misshapen, the beast's head is no less distorted.  Its canine muzzle is
twisted and oblong and its eyes, all four of them, are set to close
together.  Around the creature's neck is a collar of sorts, to which is
attached a length of chain that is draped behind the creature and becomes
hidden.

Covered in sand, dirt and small bugs this desert ogre seems to serve as a
guard for his home.  His thick, leathery skin is greyish in color with
the occasional blotch of sand.  His hair is blueish in color and is tied
up with a thin piece of rope.  His beady red eyes dart around the room,
looking for prey.

Mariposa has striking features, accented by colorful paint on her face
and arms.  Subdued shades of lavender and cerulean form sinuous patterns
about her sapphire eyes and high cheak bones.  The artful colorations
sweep all the way back to her pointed ears.  Her honey-gold hair is held
back by a thin, metal circlet, though it hangs in loose curls, cascading
like a waterfall, down her back.  The picture is completed by her fluid
movement and exquisite muscle-tone as she move from stance to stance
practicing various sword forms.

This serpent's scales are jet-black, and its body can only be seen from
certain angles, appearing almost transparent to its surroundings.  It
hovers about the room, black tail almost touching the ground.  Two
firey-red eyes mark its head, glaring upon you as a puny object about to
be crushed.

This is the largest by far of all the serpents you've had to face.  Its
body is adorned with awesome golden scales that reflect off of the room's
glow, ended with a tail of spikes.  Over 300 feet in length, it almost
seems to slither in the air, as if unaccustomed to being in the sky.  As
it roars, the great cavern trembles.  A mighty breath exhales from his
cavernous maw, a rainbow of elements cascading down upon you.

to be fading in and out from the ethereal plane, much like his body. 
White thin strands of hair trail down his back from his nearly bald head,

@RCrimson scales gleam with the harsh reflected light of burning fires,

with muscles larger than entire horses.  From overhead, twin pale orbs
shed their own minimal light.  Yellowed orbs slit with narrow black
irises resembling those of a snake, though surely no snake was every so
big as this ancient red dragon.  In the face of this being, older even
then some entire races, the dragonfear is a palpable thing laying heavy
on the air.  The raging fires about you go unnoticed as their threat
seems suddenly so much less significant than the malice embodied before
you.@n

From what you can see of this gigantic worm, it is at least a hundred
feet long, though its end is buried in the ground.  For the most part, it
resembles a humongous earthworm.  Bristles stick out of its segments,
which are caked with dirt and sand.  The sand wyrm's skin is a dark,
grey-brown and is marred by several rending scars that run in criss-cross
patterns up and down its length.  Large, chitin scales cover most of the
old sand wyrm.  The creature has no discernible eyes and what passes for
a head is dominated by three bony mandibles which come together like the
pieces of a sphere split into three lobes.  Its leathery skin is
extremely wrinkled.

At first glance, the male which stands before you looks like a simple

Looking every bit like a five foot sand crab with a human waist and legs,
the crabman that stands here is desert in tan and yellow -- two colors
that blend well in the main part of the desert.  The trader's upper body

unicorn mares~

~
with silver hooves and tri-colored horns stand here.~
A tall horse-like creature with a coat of pure white stands nobly before
you.  Its neck is graceful and its eyes are a deep, vibrant violet. 
Aside from its unusually white coat, the mare has a long, spiraling horn
which protrudes from the center of its equine forehead.  The horn tapers
to an extremely sharp point and is at least two feet long, maybe even
three.  The tip, middle and base of the horn are each a different color,
being blue, white and black respectively.  Her mane and tail are a fluid,
silver color intertwined with streaks of gold.  Shiny silver horse shoes
have been shod to her four hooves.  Surrounding the mare is an air of
innocence and purity.

This mass of yellow and gold butterflies flitters to and fro in a

parchment-thin wings with sunburst patterns done in yellow and orange on
them.  Their bodies are covered with a golden brown fuzz and each has a
pair of delicate black antennae.  The butterflies also have ruby-red eyes
surrounded by a ring of orange.  Unlike most butterflies though, the legs
on these appear to be abnormally sharp.  In addition to that, when they
alight on the nearest surface, you can see that their tongues are
unusually serrated.  Powder from their wings falls to the grounds as they
fly about in a cloud.

Garbed in light browns and yellows, the figure before you looks, at least
superficially, like a lizardwoman.  She has the lithe figure and fine
body structure of a female lizardman, but for one thing, her scales are
much too dark.  For another, her claws are much larger and more primitive
looking.  Also, her eyes are lidless and much more serpentine.  Slung
over both her shoulders are several parcels of gear and equipment, some
of which looks entirely useless.  Her unusually thick tail snakes behind
her as she moves, leaving a slithering trail along the ground.

This large, camel-like beast is covered in thick, wool-like shaggy hair. 
Its tail is like that of a horses except shorter and much thicker. 
Strong fore and hind legs prove that this beast can handle any terrain

you can find.

Clad in bright colors of gold on red, his costume seems chosen to go with

faded and it is difficult to make out the golden boars head on the red
field that is displayed.  A hooded dovetailed mantle rests on his head
and shoulders providing him some protection from the elements.  A thick
leather band hold a harp case firmly in place, out of the way, at his
back.

An elf ancient enough to be counted a legend in some parts, A'elinfael
rarely leaves the Vaasa.  His long golden hair is streaked through with
white in places giving him an austerity not often seen in elves.  Lines
of age, an even rarer sight on the llewyrr, mark his face if only with
the barest whispers of time's passing.  More than anything else, the
far-seeing look of one who has seen ages pass marking his eyes is the
guage by which you can see his status as an elder among his kind.  He is
spoken of in llewyrr legend as both a priest and a sorceror, but always
with veneration.

ticket.
~
E
red~
@RRed-colored tickets@n will allow you to enter the main theatre arena.

There are several things you should keep in mind when using the tickets
here.  You can only use each ticket once.  Once you leave a section of
the theatre that requires a ticket, you will have to purchase another one
to go back into that section.  Also, remember that if you want to go
backstage that you would have to purchase at least a red-ticket and a
yellow-ticket to get there.

If you have the red-colored ticket in your inventory, you can give it to

{tall, spiraling plants} aquatic tendril vines~
~
~
grow here, undulating with the current.~
This hearty, aquatic plant has a body of spiraling leaves that emerge
from a thick, fibrous mass that lies partly buried by sand.  Each of the
vine plant's tendrils are about five inches wide and at least fifty feet
long.  Though the tendril vines resemble sea weed, the edges of the plant
are much too flat and lacking in chlorophyll.  The tendrils of the plant
move about lively, whipping their sharp edges about dangerously.

Standing about three feet tall, this baby dragon has just emerged from
the egg.  Its bright yellow scales are still slick with moisture and its
eyes seem a bit unfocused.  The dragonling has a stubby snout with tiny,
sharp teeth and short, curved fore claws.  Its wings, though they would
span about six feet when unfolded, do not look like they can support the
hatchling' weight as of yet.  The hatchling shorts signs of having horns

{creatures resembling needle-thin stalactites} crawling piercers~

crawl toward the nearest wall.~
This is just an ordinary stalactite, made of limestone...or is it?  In
fact, the surface texture of the stalactite is too slick to be ordinary
limestone.  On closer observation, the 'stalactite' has a small, opening
and closing mouth towards it tip and it seems to have tiny, gripping legs
around its base.  A greenish-brown ichor surrounds the creatures mouth. 
Otherwise, it appears as a long, tapering dripstone formation that comes
to an extreme point.

{short, reptilian creatures} dwarf serpentmen~
~
~
with black scales stand protectively before a tree.~
Like a lizardman, this very short man has several reptilian
characteristics.  His skin is comprised of dark brown, almost black
scales and both his hands and feet end in claws.  The serpentman's neck
is nearly twice as long as that of a lizardman and looks for all the
world like a cobra's head with a slightly elongated cranium.  It also has
a tail, which looks to be thinner and more prehensile than a lizardman's. 
Outfitted in a small blue tunic and wearing a set of spectacles tied
about his head, this dwarf serpentman looks less like a warrior and more
like a scholar.

Old tickets seem to be sticking out of the backstage collections guard's

huge callous hands very similar to those in his pockets.  The collections
guard looks like a strong man, and he has quite a big nose on his face.

At the shoulder, this one-humped dromedary stands about seven feet tall. 
His legs are long and he has two-toed feet with spread, padded toes that
seem meant for walking on sand.  He has a coarse coat of fur that is tan
in color and that grows especially thick especially thick on the head,
neck, upper forelegs, and tail tip.  Judging by its dun-colored coat and
fat-storing hump, this large mammal looks to be especially suited for

Though shorter at the shoulder than a one-humped camel, this two-humped
dromedary is still taller and heavier.  Her neck is long and flexible,
suited for observing any direction without having to turn around.  The
grayish-brown coat is short and fine in this dromedary and grows
especially thick on her head, neck and upper forelegs.  Her padded toes,
all two of them, are wide spread on each foot, seemingly to make walking
on sand all the easier.  With two humps of stored fat and water, this
camel could go weeks without water or sustenance.

{large, sandy-brown spiders} desert tarantula~
~
~
with menacing eyes creep along the sand.~
Nearly a foot in diameter, this arachnid is much more than your average
house spider.  Like any other spider, it has a cephalothorax and an
abdomen, eight eyes, and eight legs.  Its legs and body are covered with
tan, bristling hairs and its eyes are as black as onyx.  The desert
tarantula also has wide chewing mandibles attached to its head.  Unlike
most spiders, this particular one lacks visible web spinnerets.  Perhaps
it uses its natural desert mimicry to ensnare unsuspecting victims.

This noble-looking creature is an odd mix of several species.  Its body
is that of a lion, complete with large toenailed paws and a rich, tan
coat.  Emerging from the sides of its leonine body are the wings of a
hawk, which are tucked in close to its body.  The head, though it is
surrounded by a thick, dark brown mane is that of a man, not a lion.  His
features are careworn but not overly hostile and his eyes are a
remarkable shade of green and speak of intelligence.  His long, leonine
tail swings back and forth at a leisurely pace.

Fatter than most serpents, this particular one is about six feet long and
about five inches in diameter.  Its scales range in size and color, from
rough and orange, to diamond-shaped and yellow.  It has a broad but flat
head with deep pits set into either size.  A sticky-looking film covers
its scaly body.  Sand and bits of desert debris cling to its body,
allowing it to blend into its surroundings more effectively.  Glaring red
orbs rest beneath its bony brow.

This long, black serpent has small, oval scales.  Around its head are
loose flaps of skin.  The serpent has short fangs and a thin, forked red
tongue.  Its amber-colored eyes seem to follow any visual clue.  Moving
with a slow and perceived grace, the cobra at least seems harmless.  On
the back of its broad head are dull white markings that resemble two

Brother Thomas smiles in a kindly manner and pats you on the back. 
"Worry not about such dangerous things, my child.  You time to will come,
soon enough." 
~
E
dark~
Brother Thomas frowns slightly, "The history of the Starkadder family and
Darkfall are very tightly enmeshed in many people's minds, though I don't
know how closely aligned the two truly are.  There is a journal in the
library below that recounts the times of Darkfall, read it and make your
own decisions."

"The Starkadder family was once a good and just ruling clan, and gave the
early city of Medienne many able Dukes.  That changed when the ruler of
the family at the time, Vadis, became close friends with a young mage by
the name of Croazner." 

~
E
o-dark~
$n has a long, quiet conversation with Brother Thomas.  Thomas does most
of the talking.
~
E
dark2~
Brother Thomas continues, "The reputation of the Starkadder became darker
as time progressed.  Vadis and Croazner were both young in those days,
and won many battles; for their clan as well as Medienne, but rumors
started to float about the town that the family was involved in dark
rites...  the fact that Vadis had bound an Ogre clan in allegiance to the
Starkadders did little to soothe the city's nerves." 
~
E
dark3~
Thomas says, "Some say that Croazner and Vadis had a hand in bringing
about Darkfall.  Whether or not that is the case, they certainly
benefitted from it, and the entire region shook under the iron hands of
that clan for many years, even after Vadis and Croazer disappeared from
the public eye, presumed dead.  The clan's reign ended here, in this
temple, and ended poorly." 
~
E
dark4~
Thomas says, "John the Bloody and Ethan Starkadder, his younger brother,
were to take wives in a double wedding.  Their brides were mysterious and
foreign, and of course rumored to be witches on top of the rest.  When
the time came for the family's priest, Marzan, to perform the rite, a
great cry rose up from outside the temple, and a mob surged through the
doors, attacking the bridal party and killing several, including both of
the young brides." 
~
E
dark5~
Thomas sighs and concludes, "Ethan and John were enraged, and slew dozens
of townsfolk before carrying their unwed mates in their arms to the
family's crypt.  With the remainder of their family's knights, and the
aid of their priest and a mage who served with them, they crafted a curse
upon the Cemetery that has lasted to this day, turning it into a
veritable armed camp of the undead.  Some say that even Croazner and
Vadis returned to this world when the rite was completed...  some say
they never left."

maw, running in small rivulets down its sharp canines.  Nearly all of its
body is covered in hard, dull yellow scales, from neck to tail.  Only the
underbelly of the yellow dragon appears unarmored and even there, the
hide looks thick enough to turn away any normal weapon.  The
emerald-green eyes of the sand dragon hold uncommon intelligence.

Huddled over a nest of sorts, the yellow dragon here is busy guarding a
small clutch of eggs.  The dragon dam's large yellow wings are tucked in
close to her body and draped over part of the nest.  For the most part,
the scales of the dam are a dull yellow color, with a few brighter scales
interspersed here and there.  Her leathery underbelly has several old,
long scars running down its length and the talons on her claws are ebony
and extremely sharp.  Her ruby-red eyes blaze like miniature suns.

yellow sand dragons~

are here, digging at the ground with their claws.~
Two thin horns jut out of the cranium of this large yellow dragon, giving
it an angular sagital crest.  Covered in a mottled mix of dull and bright
yellow scales, the sand dragon seems well suited for blending into the
desert terrain above.  Long canines and needle-sharp molars hang out of
the dragon's mouth at odd angles.  The flank of the beast has a few scars
running down it as well as a few nasty gashes on its fore arms.  Roughly
thirty feet long, the dragon's wings are tucked close to its body, so
that it might walk through the area without trouble.

rests its bulk over a depression in the floor.~
~
~
~
~
The most notable thing about this dragon, save for its tremendous length,
is that its abdomen is swollen almost to the point of being distended. 
Clearly a dam, the sand dragon has lusterless brown scales that have the
texture of sandstone.  Possessing little snout, the dragon's maw is
parabolic in shape and filled with a double row of piercing molars and
canines.  Wingless by nature, the dragon lacks grace in its movements as
is much bulkier than other species of dragons her age.  Her leathery
underbelly is a slightly different hue of brown and looks slightly more
vulnerable than the rest of her scaly body.

Largest of all the brown dragons,~

The massive fore arms and legs of this colossal dragon end in equally
large claws.  With a short snout and curved maw, the head of the dragon
resembles a horned lizard than that of a typical dragon.  Diamond-shaped
spurs that look as malicious as its talons stick up along the dragons
spine and tail.  While all but the underbelly of the dragon is covered in
dark brown scales, overall its body seems well protected.  Lacking wings,
the brown sand dragon is much more bulkier than other dragon species.

This small dragon looks little more than a few hours old and like all
infants, this ones topaz eyes show but one thing: hunger.  Its scales are
a light brown color and its eyes are barely open.  Nonetheless, it
appears to have emerged from the egg with fully sharpened claws and teeth. 
From snout to tail, the dragonling is about four feet long and has but
thorny nubs running up and down its spine.  Clearly wingless, the brown
dragon hatchling seems broader than other dragons you have seen.

Like most centipedes, this one resembles a segmented worm.  Each of its
segments is covered in brown chitin and has a pair of legs attached to it. 
The front segment of the centipede, in place of legs, has a set of
piercing mandibles which look slightly venomous.  The biting organs on
the centipede are not as much of a concern as its size, however, for the
centipede is at least six feet long.

Segmented like a worm, this millipede is remarkable for its length of
seven feet.  Clearly a giant of its species, the millipede has large,
chewing mandibles adapted to its head.  Unlike a centipede, which only
has one set of legs per segment, this giant millipede has at least two,
sometimes three pairs of legs per section.  The hard, chitinous
exoskeleton of the millipede is a mottled tan and brown color and blends
well with the desert terrain.  The millipede has no eyes as far as you
are able to discern.

tiny~
crawls around here~
Tan in color with a series of red stripes running down its back and
sides, a small desert salamander is here.  About five inches long, the
little red-striped newt has tiny, webbed feet and a long, thin tail.  Its
body is dusted with sand in a few places, especially around its pointy
nose.  Being the color of desert sand, the tiny newt's body seems to have
adapted to an arid climate for no matter the oppressive heat, its body
remains nice and cool.  The newt's wide, yellow eyes blink periodically
as the desert salamander renews their surface with moisture.

The gecko's large, slitted eyes are covered not with moveable eyelids but

lack veins and meet in a straight line down the middle of its back. 
Clearly not used for flying, the scarabs wings look to assist more in
defense and in short hops.  The thorax and abdomen of the scarab are
covered in a dung-colored chitin that is dull and scratched.  Attached to
the giant scarab's head are moving antennae and serrated, clacking
mandibles.

Drosmag~
~
Queen of the crabmen~
~
~
stands patiently next to the glass throne.~
~
~
~
~
Though fairly short, the female crabman standing here has an air of regal
authority and power that is hard to dismiss on account of her size alone. 
Attired in an oddly-shaped robe that nonetheless manages to flow about
her person, not much of her chitinous or humanoid body can be seen.  Only
her silver-ringed eye stalks and head stick up out of the robe.  On what
passes for her forehead, there is a greyish-silver birthmark of a circle
with radial rays.

The body of this crabman looks a little plump and soft around the edges.

embellished with little gemstones and metal studs.  In particular, this
crabman seems to value wealth.  His white eye stalks appear to be

Wearing little but a leather loincloth, this crabman works intently over

The crab-like arms and humanoid legs of this crabman are thickly corded

Known by my people as the Valley of Sands, there are four different sands
which have come to fill this great, twisting canyon.  The most abundant
desert soil is tan in color and fills most of the northern and eastern
sections of the desert.  Next in abundance are those parts of the desert
surrounded by sandstone canyons as black as night.  The sands within are
equally as dark.  And it is within the next smallest portion of the
desert, the red desert, that we have chosen to make our homes.  Finally,
by far the smallest desert region is the desert of white sand.  Little
known about it.  Its blazing sands reflect too much light for my people

Try as she might, this female crabman appears to have allowed age to
catch up with her.  She chitin-plated upper body is dull and shows signs
of atrophy and her white eye stalks emerged but limply from her head and
appear, at best, unfocused.  Strips of rotten cloth and valuable scarves
have been tied about the crabwoman's body, giving it a semblance of
covering.  Hanging around her neck on a shiny mithril chain is a single
red lens.  At times, she picks up the lens with her trembling, clawed
hand and holds it up to one of her eye stalk ends.

Greetings, traveler.  Not many find their way through the desert these

The People of the Valley were once Her people.  Led into this twisting
canyon by Her benevolence and fleeing from an oppressive man king, the
People at once made this place their home.  This was back in the days
when the sheltered valley was a place of life and greenery.  Not the
barren wasteland it has become.  And in those days, the people looked
much different.  We...looked much different.

In those days, the People were quick to build monuments in Her honor, as

~
E
stat1~
The People should have foreseen the happenings of this day from many
moments off.  The Pharaoh of that Day, Olybinn the I, may his name
forever be cursed, began asking more and more from the People, become
greedy for power and control.  It is alleged that he even challenged the
Goddess Herself for dominion over the People.
~
E
stat2~
The Goddess, in Her wisdom, realized that no one man should have such
total control over Her people.  But he had angered Her and once angered,
She is slow and the Pharaoh was no more and his son took his place.
~
E
stat3~
Olybinn's son, may he rot for five eternities, was twice the man his
father was, in ever malicious way possible.  He is told to have struck a
pack with the Goddess' four, lesser siblings and together they challenged
Her.
~
E
stat4~
Sadly, though lesser, the combined might of all four of Her sibling gods
was too much for Her to bear.  They usurped Her powers, and shattered Her
godly essence.  However, their victory over Her was not complete.
~
E
stat5~
The Goddess still lives on, just barely, though She has no influence over
this realm anymore.  But in the moment of Her defeat, She divided Her
powers, as only a true god can do.  Part of Her power went to protecting
the Great Pyramid, the greatest work of Her People and part went to
protecting a small part of the valley, so that no matter what Her
siblings did, they could not totally destroy at least one part of the
Valley.
~
E
stat6~
It is unclear how the Valley then became the barren Wasteland it now is,
but without Her powers protecting it, it was inevitable, some say.

looming~
watch over the forest, guarding it from harm.~
The guardian ent which stands here is one of the stoutest of the
tree-like beings you can remember seeing.  Dark brown bark covers the
torso and limbs of the ent.  Its arm-like branches are extremely lengthy
and massive, easily as thick as a ten-year old sapling.  The feet of the
ent look like wide, exposed roots that have been striped of their bark. 
Embedded in the brow of the ent is a small crystal that occasionally
catches light and throws it off in a splendid spray of rainbow colors.  A
golden yellow moss surrounds the edge of the crystal.

pure white~
with tri-colored horns paw at the ground anxiously.~
A tall horse-like creature with a coat of pure white stands nobly before
you.  Its neck is graceful and its eyes are a bright, intelligent green. 
Obviously a stallion, the unicorn has a long, spiraling horn which
protrudes from the center of its equine forehead.  The horn tapers to a
needle-sharp point and is at least two feet long, maybe even three.  The
tip, middle and base of the horn each seem to be made of a different
precious material, this being lapis lazuli, ivory and onyx respectively. 
His full mane and tail are like molten gold with streak of silver running
through it like a river's tributaries.  Golden horse shoes, a perfect
match to his golden mane, have been shod to his hooves.  Surrounding the
stallion is an almost palpable air of strength and virility.

Many years ago, my mate and I lived in a lush, flurishing grove, deep in
the heart of a valley.  The valley was protected by a powerful goddess,
and all was well.
~
E
aid2~
But then one day, our peaceful lives were shattered.  The goddess was
thwarted by her lesser siblings, and her powers of protection over the
valley faded.  This left the valley unprotected.
~
E
aid3~
And so began a horrible passage of events that ended with the loss of my
mate.
~
E
aid4~
I had gone out scouting, trying to find a suitable place to rest out the
winter in what remained of the once mighty grove.  But in my absence,
some vile creaturee smelling of filth entered the remnants of the grove
and attacked my mate.  Before I could arrive to assist her, the creature
had savagely cut off her alicorn.
~
E
aid5~
Often our race have been hunted for our horns, for they are magical and
are what give us life.  Before, when the goddess protected the valley,
never had to worry about the hunters.  But after her usurpation, it was
terrible.  My mate and I were the last of our kind, and I had failed her!
~
E
aid6~
In rage, I chased the hunter from the grove, past the pyramid, and for
many leagues beyond.  Nonetheless, I finally lost him.  And I haven't
been able to return to the grove since.  The memories are too painful.
~
E
raid~
The unicorn stallion bows its head and you feel it communing with $n.
~
E

If the alicorn which was stolen from my mate is found and placed once
again on her head, she can be brought back to life!
~

So tell me, please, will you help me?

I am grateful that you have undertaken this momentous task.  Once you
find the alicorn, I beg you to journey to the valley grove, south of the
Great Pyramid, and restire my beloved to life.

of alien beauty cower behind the fountain.~
The nymph's long, platinum-blonde hair is plaited into a single braid
that cascades down her back.  With ivory-toned skin, the extraordinarily
beautiful woman is beyond anything you have every encountered before. 
Wearing little but a few, cleverly placed maple leaves, the thin, limber
maiden warrants much attention.  Her eyes, which sparkle like diamonds,
are the most unusually shade of green you have ever seen.

Taller than a human and having twice the average girth, the creature
before you is made almost entirely of sand.  Its hands and feet are
overly large and look capable of smashing even the thickest of materials. 
Its face is almost featureless, save for a gaping maw and two beady,
depthless pits that must be its eyes.  A few bits and pieces of stone
debris are mixed in with its sandy body.

The scales of this reptilian creature are black in color with a light
dusting of brown.  A little under six feet tall, this more sinister
version of a lizardman has sharp, protruding canines and outwardly
jutting incisors.  Ending in claws, both the serpentman's feet and hands
look dangerous and best avoided.  its slitted eyes are lidless and yellow
and seem to be ever watchful for movement or change.  Behind the muscular
serpentman trails a thick, scaly black tail.

The slim musculature of the serpentman before you is better suited for
running and light hunting than anything else.  The serpentman's scales
are dark brown, almost black and are cracked in two in a couple of places
along its body.  With long, rending claws and a thick, whipping tail, the
serpentman looks like a capable fighter.  His slitted, yellow eyes peer
about nervously, surveying the area every chance it gets.  Darting in and
out between its double row of needle-like teeth, the serpentman's black,
forked tongue tastes the air.

A hulking brute of sand with a columnar body looms over you.  Its arms
are as thick as tree trunks, ending in two-fingered mitts and it has
little or no definition to its lower body.  Instead of legs, its lower
body moves along a flowing mass of viscous sand that holds no sand for
long.  Set into the sand golem's face where eyes should be are two gems;
a green one and a clear one.  Both are finely cut and look quite valuable. 
Though its wide mouth gaps open, it emits no sound.

The small dragonlet before you flies the air currents on a pair of tiny,

This desert is very large.  And dangerous.  But it did not always be this

Once, long ago, there was but a single race of dragons dwelling in this
valley.  Sadly, my kind is but a magical mutation from that great race. 
For a long time, the dragons and People of the Valley lived in harmony. 
But then, something happened.  After the Goddess was betrayed, the
usurper captured the two most favored of the dragons and through some
spell, imprisoned them.  Once they were ensorcelled, the last pharaoh and
his magicians tortured and transformed the remaining dragons, creating
two races of them which were directly opposed to one another.  The
battles and sorceries began draining the life out of the Valley itself. 
And without the Goddess' protection, it eventually became a barren
wasteland.

small enough to fit on the feet of a pixie.  In one hand, the little

More than a foot tall, this large bird at first looks deformed.  Its

While its eyes stare ahead, the avian does not appear to be concerned
with its surroundings in the least.  Most of the bird's tail and flight

Bloated and smelly, this zombie lizard seems ignorant of its surroundings. 
Its round, slitted eyes are covered in a dull grey film and rigor mortis
has set its tail into a permanent shape.  In places, the tiny lizard's
scales have fallen off, revealing thin, green hide beneath.  The claws of
the lizard look just as sharp as they must have been in life, though its
movements are very sluggish.  The lizard's forked tongue hangs out of the
side of its mouth, rotting and drawing insects.

It is unclear what this large and shaggy beast truly is.  It looks to be
a cross between an extremely large moorhound and a grizzley bear.  The
creature has muscular fore arms and hind legs, each of which end in
stiff, flat paws.  Six-inch, curved nails protrude from each paw, some of
which are cracked or broken.  While its body is grossly misshapen, the
beast's head is no less distorted.  Its canine muzzle is twisted and
oblong and its eyes, all four of them, are swollen.  Much of its skin and
muscle tissues bear clear signs of decay and a fetid air surrounds the
creature.

A foul, noxious odor emanates from this bloated beast.  Eight feet in
diameter, the huge, worm-like beast rises but partly out of the ground. 
There is no telling how much of it lies below the surface.  Entire
sections of its plated body have been torn away and hang onto the sand
wyrm by the merest strips of hide.  Thick, wiry bristles jut outward
between the more intact armor plates of the sand wyrm, acting as feelers
for the otherwise blind creature.  Though clearly dead, the animated sand
wyrm seems to be lying in wait for something.

At first glance, the creature before you looks like a noble, white horse. 
With metal-shod hooves and a mane of silver and gold, the horse stands
about three spans taller than most.  Its eyes are red and so fiery that
they practically glow.  Its as you gaze at its eyes that a few things
become apparent about the horse.  The first is that it is a unicorn, in
truth, for a long, sharp horn protrudes from the middle of its forehead. 
The second is that its hide is more pale than you would expect and a
swarm of flies surround the unicorn.  Most importantly, though, you see
that the unicorn has been dead for quite some time.  Its body is bloated
and strips of flesh have begun peeling off of it.

Also, the usually bright, vigorous eyes shared by nearly all ents are
instead glazed over and milky white on this specimen.  every movement the

Though considered young by its size, this bloated dragon is already as
tall as a human.  Were it not for the fetid smell, clouds of flies, and
scavenging worms swarming in and around the beast, one might mistake it
for a dragon with but dull and colorless scales.  However, these can be
explained more simply: the dragon is dead.  It no longer has any wings to
speak of, if ever it did and one of its eyes has been clawed out.  Mostly
colorless, the young dead dragon's scales are dented and broken in
several places.  All up and down the dragon zombie's tail there are bite
marks and chunks of flesh and scale missing.

Very little flesh remains on the bones of this camel zombie.  What does,

eyes has been knocked out of its skull and hangs loosely by rotting
tendons and muscle.  Though its humped back is bloated and sunken, the

crawl along the ground, unable to fly.~
Almost comedic, this zombie bat is fat and bloated, like one of the dolls
a toymaker might make.  The thin membranes on its wings are ripped are
shredded and pieces of fur have begun falling out of its decomposing body. 
Also, the claws at the end of its wings and feet are stiff with rigor
mortis.  A thin red fluid dribbles down the bat's needle-sharp canines.

The skeletal body of this dragon is horribly mutilated.  Its bones are
cracked and broken in many places, leaving pieces of its ribcage and
skull completely missing.  The inside of the skull is partly exposed in
one place, on the same side where one of its large horns has been broken
in half.  Most of its claws are still quite sharp, though a couple are
split and jagged.  Sand clings to many of the dragon skeleton's bones.

Held together by rotting cartilage and magic, the skeleton of a creature
resembling a lizardman stands here stiffly.  Unlike a lizardman, the
skeletal structure of this being is clearly much more serpentine.  Its
neck bones are longer, its body is more columnar, and its claws are much
too wide.  Lacking eyes or flesh, the five foot skeleton in itself might
seem menacing.  Added to this though is an unearthly, crimson glow that
sits in each of the skeleton's empty eye sockets.

wings are flared open.  In place of eyes, a ruddy red glow sits in its

Bleached and white, this skeletal lizard seems ignorant of its

sand wyrms~
~
~
rise out of the ground with clacking mandibles.~
About thirty feet long and a foot tall, what you see before you resembles
a gigantic, segmented earthworm.  It has bristle-like hairs which stick
out of its segmentations and its body is slick in some places and covered
with sand in others.  Unlike a worm, though, this creature has a tough,
leathery hide on which are attached close fitting chitinous scales.  Each
scale is about five inches in diameter and look to be several inches
thick.  For a mouth, the wyrm has a tri-sectioned mandible, each ending
in barbed bone.  Milky white eyes, obviously blind, are set into the side
of the wyrm's 'head,' just behind its mandibles.  The sides of the wyrm's
body are scared deeply in a few places and a couple of its scales are
dented.

A particularly well-groomed patron of the theatre stands before you

The manic creature you see before you may be human.  It is hard to tell

story~
The clearing you see before you is very old.  The trees who's branches
shelter this clearing and create the canopy were here since the begining
of time.  The clearing is the home of the dragon hatchery, every dragon
that ever was started under this very canopy.  The rocks you see there to
the east, are not rocks but eggs.  Some have been here for hundreds of
years waiting for their turn to hatch.  A great magic covers this
clearing, allowing many climates to exist.  It allows for harmony in the
clearing, no dragons fight each other here.
~
E
rstory~
@WThe gnomish warrior continues telling his tale to $n.@n
~
E
story2~
You can climb that egg to the east if you wish to venture further but be
warned, the clearing and everything under the canopy are dangerous. 
Dragons waiting to leave the hatchery and find a cave or forest of there
own can destroy even the heartiest warrior.
~
E
story3~
If you do go good luck to you, and may the riches of the canopy come to
you.

You see before you a huge toadlike monster with a horn protruding from

to be alive.  Slow forming warts form on its body, bursting randomly to
release a foul smelling gas.  Once burst, the warts leave behind open
sores that rapidly fester and fill with a greenish-yellow pus.

The humanoid remains before you are perhaps 4' tall, though a definite

greasy, matted hair that covers most of the body has fallen away in
patches.  Gore stains the teeth of the reanimated corpse's canine head. 
The eyes that stare from the dog-like head have a milky film over them as

A fully complete skeletal remains of a small humanoid remains amazingly

four foot tall form is topped with a skull that seems somehow wrong, more

bugbear skeletons~
~
~
click and clatter about on their own.~
A large humanoid skeleton ambulates under its own power, creating quite a
ruckus as the raw bones grate and clatter against each other.  It stands
just under seven feet tall, and though nearly picked clean, in places a
bit of flesh or muscle remains tenuously clinging to bone.  The gruesome
remains of just enough hair-covered flesh remains on the right side of
the skull like some insane mask provide just enough nauseating evidence
to prove that this was once a bugbear.

Dressed in green raiment, this quiet spectre regards you in silence.  His
eyes are a deep brown, and cast a somber look about the room.  His face
is drained of color, and there is a scar running down his cheek from near
one of his eyes.  Strangely enough, he appears to be fading in and out of
view, as if unfocused or not wholly there.  A powerful yellow aura all
around him seems to light up the room.  A silver sword shines in his
hands, also wavering in and out of focus, but looking powerful in his
grip.

This mighty beast was once a mere human named Nordun, until a curse was
put upon him and his brethren.  Its mouth is wreathed in flame, frost,

scales glisten in the light, a sparkling pink which seems to change in
different light.  A golden crown sits on its head, forever a reminder of
who Nordun once was.  Well over one-hundred feet long, it spans the width
and breadth of the room with its tail and body, and its head reaches to
the ceiling.  Black eyes eye you in hate, and chill your blood to the

Drak'tar~
~

A juvenile @b@Rred dragon@n rests here, flames shooting out of his nostrils.~
~
~
~
~
This young red dragon is quite large, towering a good 12 feet into the
air.  His scales are a bright, glossy scarlet color which constantly
shine everytime he breaths a stream of fire.  His tail is fairly short
but has several massive spikes lining it.  A pair of massive horns
protrude from his head which look extremely sharp.  Every few moments he
stretches out his wings and then folds them back to his body.

Before you stands Sir Dagrith, one of the most famous and well known

of shimmering white armor which is almost blinding to look at directly. 
Held in his hand is a massive broadsword which has several runes etched
across its blade.  His eyes portray a look of honor and dignity and by
the looks of this stern paladin, he is a force to be reckoned with should
evil arise.

sandstone rocks~

~
with sandy trails behind them sit here.~
Sitting on the ground, minding its own business, is a very old looking
sandstone rock.  Its surface is pitted with the assault of both abrasive
desert winds and the occasional rending gash of what is probably some
desert reptile.  Though large enough to sit upon, its rough, craggy
surface is fairly bumpy, which would make the experience unpleasant at
the very least.  The bottom of the sandstone rock is beveled, as if by
something other than nature.

Not the largest orc you have ever seen, Thangmar is perhaps the ugliest. 
The left side of his face is scarred, with thick bones sticking out at
the cheek.  The left ear is also missing, with nothing but a vile hole to
remind you it was there. Despite these hideous scars, Thangmar is stil
quite capable.

This is Cullin, Medienne's resident village idiot.  Cullin can usually be
found staring straight ahead with a rather vacuous look in his glassy
eyes.  If not for his noticably peculiar actions he would be a fairly
good looking man by human standards.  His shoulder-length hair is mostly
free of tangles at the moment and his clothes are more or less unrumpled
and mostly clean.  Other town members take turns keeping an eye on him as
he seems to take little notice of himself.

flicks in and out.  Its scales are solid black, and a triangular pattern

Once a possibly a powerful ranger, now this poor man has watched his

out a long sigh as he straightens up with the aid of his sword.

Forest of the Kings."@n

Periytian leans against his sword and continues to speak: @e"I have taken
it upon myself to warn all those travelling through these parts of the
dangers that lurk inside the forest.  Many a good ranger has died in
there trying to battle the evil and although it seems hopeless we
continue to fight.  Within the forest are several illusions which the
demons have conjured up to confuse and destroy unwanted visitors."@n
~
E
speak1~
Periytian points westward at the vast forest and says: @e"Within the
forest are five crossroads and five illusions.  I do not know what
exactly each is or what they hide but I can give you this bit of
information.  The first is true, the second is false, the third is false,
the fourth is true and the fifth is false.  If you can decipher the
meaning of it then you will be able to pass the forest boundries.  I do
urge you though, on the other side of the forest lies the city of
Morindale, the source of the evil in the land, you may not be powerful
enough to survive but I know of something that can help you also."@n 
~
E
speak2~
With a muffled groan of pain, Periytian continues to speak to you:
@e"Within the forest lies the ancient catacombs of the king's of
Morindale.  Many of them died while trying to defeat the demons and their
bodies were placed there under a magical guard.  Within the catacombs are
items of great magical power which can be used to help stop the demons
and banish them back to the Abyss from which they came.  I do not know
the exact location of the entrance or where inside the catacombs lie the
artifacts, that is for you to find out.  For now though, I wish you luck
and good fortune in your journies and hope that you can help bring out
land back to its previous glory."@n

This five-foot long mink resembles an aquatic version of a weasel with
its whiskers, narrow eyes, and long bushy tail.  The dark brown fur of
this enormous creature shines in the light.  Its beautiful fur looks
plush, soft, and exceedingly comfortable to touch.

Tough scales of light brown threaded with black cover this horrific snake. 
Its body is thick, perhaps five inches in diameter at the widest point,
and its tail tapers to a dull, blunted point.  Its head is wide with
large, frightening eyes that seem to glaze over in a sort of trance as it
watches you.

Old age seems to be approaching the mystic as his unkempt yellow hair has
partly fallen out of his wrinkled head.  Slowly running out of his nose
towards his mouth is a trail of green snot, and clumps of dirt appear
stuck in his eyebrows and yellow mustache.  HIs eyes are deeply inset
into his head so that his eyes appear almost hidden by the dark shadow
his forehead casts.

High Bishop~
~

of Grottington is praying before the altar.~
~
~
~
~
Engaged in a prayer, the High Bishop has a very peaceful, pious look.  He
is rather short, even for a goblin, and his robes touch the ground and
bunch up so that his legs cannot be seen.  He is holding his palms
together and has his eyes closed revealing a set of dark blue eyelids.

A middle-aged gentleman, Professor Frippet holds his head high, looking
down the bridge of his warty nose.  Little brown moles with hairs
sticking out of them speckle his neck destroying any smooth skin he once
had there.  His graying hair reaches down to his shoulders and is very
knotted from lack of care.

He is nothing more than a combination of skin and muscle.  Every muscle
on his arms and legs bulge out to show everyone who sees them the power
they are capable of.  As you look at him, he takes the time to look you
over as well to make sure you aren't causing trouble.  Although he looks
powerful, he also looks rather disgusting as his nose drips an unpleasant
yellow goo.

The brown-eyed guard has many scars on his body apparently from a long
experience with battle.  Muscles peek out from under the guard's
protective armor.  A wrinkle or two around his forehead is even further
enhanced by the muscles near his temples.  As he looks you over, he
displays his needle-sharp teeth while smirking at you.

The man before you is oddly pale, almost completely white in fact.  His
black hair goes slightly past his shoulders and is thick and luxurious. 
You notice bright green eyes that seem to capture and reflect back light,
causing them to sparkle.  His attire is rumpled, but still very elegant. 
Looking over him you cannot find a single wrinkle.

Merely a mass of shadows, this being has no predefined shape or structure
to it.  It constantly morphs its outline to appear like that of a clawed
beast, a tall humanoid and a small dragon.  Two white dots seem to serve
as eyes for the being although those too are transparent and keep no
shape.  Swirling about the shadow is a light crimson mist which ripples
through its opaque form.

white centuar warriors~

heavily-muscled~
eye you with suspicion.~
This heavily-muscled white centaur has the body of a pure white stallion. 
His long tail is as white as snow and covered with intricate beaded
straps which keep it from fraying.  His long, blonde hair shines like the
sun and a few strands of it have been braided and tied back with a silk
rope.  Like a gentle blue sea, his eyes show compassion and peace but
also tell a story of a veteran fighter who knows never to trust a
stranger.

The human female before you is the perfect example of what beauty is. 
She has long blond hair, reaching to her lower back.  Blue eyes that seem
to capture the light and sparkle stare out from a beautiful face.  Her
skin is the perfect example of alabaster, and doesn't have a wrinkle on
it that you can detect.  Her shape is full-figured.  Her clothing, while
elegant, seems old and out-of-date.

This beetle stands nearly five feet tall.  She is quite the oddest beetle
you have ever seen.  She glows softly with a golden light which radiates
out through all parts of her clear, crystalline body.  You can, in fact,
see right through her to the wall of the chamber.  In the middle of her
faceted carapace is only a brilliant golden light, impossible to look
directly at for long.

Known throughout the land as one of the wisest sages that ever lived,
Acalith now spends his remaining years as the advisor to the Lord of
Darkhaven.  Several wrinkles covered his tanned, leathery face, testament
to the years he has watched come and go.  His deep, piercing black eyes
seem almost magical and as he looks upon you, you feel as if he were
probing your mind for any hidden secrets.  His long, flowing black robes
are covered in ancient runes and sigils which glow with a pale blue light. 
Within his hands are a dusty stone tome and a staff carved like to look
like a serpent.

This large speciman must be a half-breed of some sort.  He is almost as
large as an ogre, but lacks the wild look that they have.  His facial
features are much more human, aside from the thick brow.  His hair is cut
short, and his face has several days of thick beard growth.

Tall and lithe, Korlaka wanders about her mother's cave, dispensing a
harsh trollish justice with her meaty fists.  Matted hair clings to a
head with a slightly less bony look than the other trolls of this cave
complex, above eyes with a frighteningly sharp intellegence.  Her skin is
an odd dusky grey, and stretches across sinewy muscles that seem built
for speed.

Somewhat smaller than the other harpies, this one seems much more

hello~
Hello young one, I suppose you have come to hear the legend of the well. 
Many have come before you, none have returned.
~
E
legend~
The well was once the pride of this area; the first man made water source
ever.  Great amounts of magic and work went into it.  Only problem was we
made it too close to the ocean and the walls of the aqueduct cracked. 
Sea water filled the well and made it useless to us.  We closed the well
to prevent people from drinking the tainted water.
~
E
mermen~
Rumor has it that the wells cracking was no accident.  A group of mermen
warriors live in the near by waters and some think they cracked the well. 
The aqueduct is now filled with a vast amount of sea life as well as with
the mermen who patrol their aquired territory.
~
E
me~
Everyone else left the area when the well was closed.  I had no place
else in this world save the shack you stand in today.  I stayed living
out the rest of my years and telling others the story of this well.

~
E
mermen~
The mermen live in the surrounding waters of this beach.  A powerful
wizard saved them in a war long ago and as payment they now guard the
only passage to the gyspy island that lies in the distant seas.

~
E
gypsy~
So you want to know about the gyspy island do you.  Well the island is a
prison of sorts.  A powerful wizard banned the group their long ago.  The
mermen that call the waters near by their home guard the only passage to
the island.  Strong magical currents created by the wizard make it
impossible to reach the island by ship.

giant~
dig around in the sand.~
Standing upright, the desert scarab would be about four feet all.  As it
is, while it is resting on its six segmented legs, the desert beetle is
nearly a foot high.  Unlike other insects, the front wings of the scarab
lack veins and meet in a straight line down the middle of its back. 
Clearly not used for flying, the scarabs wings look to assist more in
defense and in short hops.  The thorax and abdomen of the scarab are
covered in a dung-colored chitin that is dull and scratched.  Attached to
the giant scarab's head are moving antennae and serrated, clacking
mandibles.

well-defined, and several scars in the shape of a lightning bolt
accentuate the muscles on his legs.  Despite his powerful build, what
commands your attention is his impish grin and his battle-ready stance.

Though large, the dragon before you stands with a deft grace that belies
its bulk.  Hexagonel crystal scales of various sizes armor its body from
its long, sweeping neck to its short, stubby tail.  Tines of crystal jut
outward from the tip of its tail like the barbed spikes on a triclopse's
club.  The crystal dragon's browbridges slant downward at a protective
angle, shielding its green, slitted eyes.  Also, the claws on the dragon
look impossibly sharp and well-honed.

Before you stands a being of air and flesh.  From the waist down, there
is nothing but a swirling cyclone of air.  But atop the column is the
torso of a strong, muscular man.  His eyes are slightly slanted and quite
intelligent.  Bands of iron are clamped around the djinn's wrists. 
Trailing behind the djinn is a long, black ponytail.

Like a geyser, the lower half of this being gushes crystal blue water up

oversized human.  Its hands are quite large and are bound by red bands
engemmed with lapis lazuli.  The marid's eyes are his most unusual
feature.  They seem to speak of endless cruelty and intellect.

At first glance, you see a young human woman who is maybe twenty five
years of age.  Her clothing is a bit shabby and she carries herself with
a wary grace.  A closer inspection, though, reveals that the woman's face
has a feral quality to it and is covered in a light dusting of redish fur. 
She has an unusual nose, like that of a fox and her ears are large and
tufted.

Standing at least eight feet tall, you see what at first looks to be

an iron chest as thick as a barrel, the golem before you looks onward
with faceted garnets for eyes.  Emblazoned on its chest is the mark of a

Surrounded by a nimbus of fire, this being is made of both flesh and
flame.  From the waist up, you see the body of a large, humanoid male
with the physique of a blacksmith.  Around each of his massive wrists are
mithril bands with a fire opal set into each.  Rather than having a lower
body, from the waist down he is nothing but an undulating column of flame. 
His eyes are of blue flame, which compliments his blue-black ponytail
that hangs down his back.

{blue horses with tails like dolphins} hippocampi~

prance about.~
With the body of a horse and the tail of a dolphin, the gait of this
creature must be awkward on land.  Nonetheless, an eerie air of
perfection and grace surrounds the creature some have come to call a
hippocampus.  While it might be more at home in the water rather than on
land, the hippocampus looks at ease with its surrondings.  The
hippocampus's hair is a deep, sea blue color that compliments its foamy
green mane.  Scintillating, the hooves of the hippocampus look as though
they are made of mother of pearl.

Larger than the largest warhorse, this young dragon has shiny copper
scales that are slightly curved around the edges.  He has a leathery

but healed scars up and down his wing membranes and a few slashes across
his flanks.  It would appear he is not novice to combat.  Though

More than your average steed, before you stands a powerful and yet
elegant horse with both a set of wings and a four foot horn protruding
from her forehead.  And unlike most horses, the coat of this one is blue
with soft, silken hair.  Also, her tail and mare are of the purest, most
radiant white you have ever seen - and they match the color of her wing
feathers perfectly.  The horn which juts out of the middle of her
forehead is a long, tri-colored spiral of ivory, lapis lazuli and onyx.

The most clear and striking detail about this powerful horse is that he

its non-corporeal form.  Though of about the same size of a trained war
horse, this creature is anything but.  Its eyes are a brilliant green
color and so piercing that there is no question that it is intelligent. 
The spirit horse carries itself with a proud yet weary demeanor.

Before you stands a griffon - a powerful creature with an air of nobility

Harnessed and tamed, the chaotic forces of pure lightning have been

thundermare has a strong, muscular body and a broad back, able to carry
an armored knight.  But in shape are where the similarities with a mere

To mistake this beast for a horse would require more than being just half

perch warily.~
Twisted beyond anything any sane homonculator might intend, this creature
is a griffon of the most vicious magnitude.  No griffons are said to be
more fierce than black ones.  Unlike most griffons, the body of this one
is that of a panther and its head and wings are those of an angry roc. 
Its head has an enormous beak and its claws, particularly its back ones,
are long and wicked.

The horse before you looks like it could have ridden out of some dark
dream.  Her coat is a black, midnight-blue color and is glossy from being
well-groomed.  Her hind and fore legs are strong and muscular and her
back is broad.  The nightmare's hooves, mane, and eyes are sooty, red
flames that crackle and flare with life of their own.  Indeed, this mare
looks to have ridden from a dark, twisted nightmare rather than a mere
dream.

The bulky, twisted mass of scales before you is a frighteningly grotesque

behemoth are mithril-hard, and covered with a flame-retardant slime.  A
dull, greyish-green, the monstrous serpent matches the hue of the water

but appears to be formed entirely of water.  Its crystal clear waters
swirls violent like a whirlpool up and down its body from its legs to its
arms.  The rippling whirlpool, though, is intersected by two smaller
pools of darker water that swirl about in tight concentration where eyes
might be.  Aside from these, the watery behemoth has no facial or body

Six feet tall and formed of flame, the being before you has twice the

shoot off periodically from its fiery body.

Before you stands a creature made entirely of black earth.  With legs the

Superficially, this creature looks like a very large, very powerful
canine.  Its teeth are sharp and its paws wide.  Also, its muscular frame
lends to it the attributes of a hunter.  Trailing behind the creature is
a long, thin tail that wags to and fro frequently.  The creatures eyes
and body, though, are indicative to its true nature.  The unusually large
dog's eyes are swirling chasms of madness, changing color and texture to
match the primal elementals of earth, air, fire and water.  The
creature's entire form seems to change composition at a whim to
correspond to its eyes.

Were it not for the fact that his skin texture and color appears to
change from moment to moment, you might mistake the man before you as a
human.  But as his skin and eye color change from blue to red, red to
green, green to violent, and back again to blue, it is quite obvious that
he is anything but human.  Dressed is a carefully tailored violet and
green outfit and wearing red high boots chased in blue, the man has a
regal air about him.  On his brow he wears a diadem of interwoven flame,
air, water and earth.

rests here, his eyes filled with concern.~
~
~
~
~
Apparently in his late hundreds, this fragile looking human is scarred by
many wrinkles and old battle scars on almost every bit of his flesh that
you can see.  His almond-shaped eyes have no permanant color, rather they
cycle through the hues of a rainbow.  His long white robes are covered
sigils and runes which pulse with a deep crimson light.  A look of
concern, worry and possibly even fear crosses his face every moment as he
glances around.

Lieriae grasps his cane and says with a worry-worn face: "For centuries I

this time I will heed the warnings.  We must prepare for battle, my child. 
The fate of the land rests in your hands alone."

Lieriae signs deeply and says: "I must rest now.  When I have consulted

place these words upon thee.  At no time should you ever doubt yourself
or your faith.  Believe in your gods, for only then will ye be able to
harness the power that may save us.  Become chaotic, lose sight of this
goal or doubt yourself, and our doom will be handed to us and not even
the gods combined can save us then." 
~
E
demons~
Lieriae's face pales and he begins to speak: "The demon lord known as
Gza'r has been awakened within the depths of the Nine Hells.  The last
time he awoke several races were exterminated.  To put it in simple
terms, he is a Tanar'ai demon, one of the worst kind.  He is able to
control hordes of demons at his own free will."

Lieriae stares at you and says: "The only way to stop him is to slay him
with the staff of the four winds.  Its last known location was the Temple
of the Phoenix within the Black Wastes.  The location of the temple is
unknown but legends hint of it being to the northwest of the mountains. 
Find the staff and return to me when you have it.  Then I shall inform
you on how to use it.  Make haste, the demon lord arrives soon."

Before you hovers the spirit of a beautiful elven women.  Due to her

are two puncture wounds on her neck, they are bright red.  Odd, since the

thank~
Thank you!  Let me tell you how I came to this retched form...
~
E
part1~
My husband, Luvon, was an adventurer, like you I think.  He left one day
with a group of companions to go on a great adventure, deep into the
lands of the east, past all of the land that is currently common
knowledge.  Several weeks later, only one member of his party, Nethmurta,
returned.  She was very weak, with many wounds all over her, and drained
of blood nearly to death.  Luckly, she was a great mage and managed to
create a gate of some sort back to Medienne, where she was found outside
of the west gate.
~
E
part2~
While Brother Thomas and his fellow clerics tried to heal her, she
related her tail to them, and it was later told to me by the clerics. 
Apparently Luvon's band of adventurers made it to an unexplored castle
which is very ancient.  After slaying many monsters and passing many
dangerous traps they made it to a set of stairs leading to a crypt below
the castle.  Upon descending these stairs the party found a group of very
powerful undead.  All of the party was slain by these beings, except for
Nethmurta.  She said they were very powerful, capable of sucking the
blood out of a person in an instant!  Later I was to learn of just how
accurate she was.
~
E
part3~
A year later what remained of my family, my only daughter and I, were
visited by a horrible curse.  The curse was brought down unknowningly by
Luvon, and resulted in our deaths.  Late one night, while I was reading
by the fire and my daughter was asleep in bed three travelers showed up
at my door.  When I greeted them they immediately grabbed me, and started
talking about revenge for the death of their kind.  Apparently, before he
died Luvon managed to kill two of the beings that had slain him and his
comrades, and now these three undead were here to do the same to myself
and my daughter!
~
E
part4~
And that is exactly what they did.  We were taken down to our basement,
and forced to watch as the undead used many powerful magics to transport
an ancient burial crypt into what was once a large and cozy basement! 
When they finished a bone-chilling, freezing wind blew constantly up into
our house!  The last thing I remember is hearing my daughter scream as
she and I were slain together, over an odd well with a freezing wind
pouring out of it.  After a while I awoke to find myself a ghost! 
Summoning up as much of my will as I could, I managed to become the
semi-solid spirit you see before you.  In a few hours horrible memories
started to work their way into my head, forcing me to remember my
daughters and I's death!
~
E
part5~
The undead beings had cursed my daughter and I, to exist as spirits
hovering over these lands forever, then slain us and allowed our blood to
collect in the well.  I believe if these undead beings are destroyed, my
daughter and I can go to the eternal rest that awaits us, and to Luvon. 
Perversely, these beings have now made our old home their lair, killing
some of the innocent towns folk of Medienne to exist!  Please @Ctell@n me
you will @Caccept@n this quest!
~

~
E
reason~
I am grateful that you are willing to try and free my daughter and I.  To
release you need only kill the leader of the three undead, for that one
is most responsible for our deaths!  Here is the key to our house, do not
lose it for it is the only one I have!
~
E
doing~
I know you are trying to slay these beings already $n, and I thank you.
~
E
done~
What are you talking about $n, you have already slain these beings silly!
~
E
secret~
Also, the land upon which our house is built was once sacred to the Elves
of the Vaasa, as such the ground still contains many magics.  To aid you
in your quest, you can bury the heart of a frost giant shaman in the
ground behind my house to summon forth a very special rose bush.  The
roses will help you to slay the evil undead, though what their specific
use is I can not say.

Thus is Murphy, master of philosophies and the universal laws.  Though he
is responsibile for the codification of quite a few of the universal
laws, he is perhaps best known for the one that received his name;
Murphy's Law.  If anything can go wrong, it will.

oops~
As you go to attack Murphy you slip on a banana peel, spin crazily about
and go careening into nearby objects.  In the process you manage to bash
your funny bone, then hopping about in agony you stub a toe, bash your
knee and crack your head causing a well-spring of blood to cover your
face.  By the time you recover, you realize you've completely forgotten
your original intent was to attack Murphy.  Better luck next time.

This massive puddle of liquid is grey in color and has a fetid odor

Built from brass, a large golem stands here with an impassive expression
on its burnished face.  The golem's body is roughly cylindrical in shape
and attached to it are broad arms and sturdy legs made from banded of
riveted brass.  Atop its shiny head is a triangular fin with a fine,
sharp edge.  The only evidence that the golem is more than just a statue
is the pair of gleaming blue eyes that peek out from beneath two sculpted
brass eye brows.

The body of this golem is a direct contrast to its arms and legs.  While
its grey body is slender and sleek, both its arms and legs are massive
and heavy.  The lead golem's arms are like jagged, serrated blades of a
sacrificial and look extremely sharp.  The only thing sharper on the
golem's body are its filed, pointed canines that jut downward from its
large, circular mouth.  Set into its angular head are two pits of
blackness that appear to serve as the construct's eyes.

Made of platinum, this golem looks extremely valuable.  Luckily, it
probably looks too menacing and massive for even the most courageous
thief to try and steal.  Its body is cylindrical in shape and has two
sculpted arms adjoining it.  The golem's base appears to be little more
than a moveable stand.  Its head is flat and jutting from each of its
polished, platinum hands are extremely long spikes.

Forged into the form a man fit for battle, the contours of this golem
follow the shape of massive muscles.  The iron golem resembles a human in
every way except for its complete lack of hair and his hands, which have
been molded into the shape of mallets.  Much strength looks to lie behind
those wide, iron arms.  Set into the golem's narrow iron head are two
small, sapphire jewels which glow faintly and serve as the construct's
eyes.

looks like a solid suit of armor with bright green eyes glowing beneath a
sloped, helm-like head.  The ends of the obsidian golem's arms end in
massive hands s and along its shoulders, jutting outward like a
porcupine's quills, are sharpened obsidian flakes with rapier-thin edges.

Made of stone, this golem looks extremely massive.  The golem's stone
body has a sculpted look to it, as if someone carved each of its limbs
from a block of stone and fastened them all together.  Its body is
cylindrical in shape and has two sculpted arms adjoining it.  The stone
golem's base appears to be little more than a moveable stand spilt down
the middle to form two thick, tree trunk-like legs.  Its head is broad
and flat and has a pair of cold black eyes set into it.

Carved from quartz, the body of this golem is massive and broad.  Thick

clear, legs made from the same quartz as its body.  The golem's head is
thin and transparent and is lit from within by a royal-blue glow. 
Jutting from the center of its chest is a long spike of quartz.

This golem has been polished to a gleaming shine.  Constructed from

form is crafted from blue topaz.  The ends of its orange arms are tipped
with even bright orange topaz claws.  Its bright blue topaz head, with

This massive golem has been constructed from the purest corundum . Its

piercing tips and set into its shoulders are wedges of sliced corundum
that has been give sharp edges.  The lower half of its body looks more
like a mobile stand than a pair of legs.  But they have been faceted and
cut to a clarity any jeweler would be hard pressed to match.  Two
sky-blue sapphires wink out from beneath its ruby corundum helm.

strength looks to lie behind those wide, crystalline arms.  Set into the
golem's narrow, crystal head are two small, radiant green eyes.  The
golem's chest glows with a soft green light and for the first time, you
notice that the facets and lattice structuring of the crystalline golem
is that of green starite.

Stuart is a young human lad in his mid teens and is well-known by the
Chiiron citizenry if not often seen.  Any citizen on the street could
point him out and tell you that, yes he's Prenslie's assitant, though
he's usually out of town on business for Prenslie so you won't see him
often.
His arms hold an assorted mass of looseleaf parchments, scrolls, vials
containing various ground herbs and powders as well as the odd rod or
wand poking out from place to place.  As he shambles about he
occassionally seems to lose the odd parchment or two which, frotunately
for Prenslie's sake, magically disapear a moment after they touch ground.

E
papers~
Stuart seems to be talking to himself, deep in thought.  You make out
something along the lines of "...that sheaf of paper?  If I don't find it
he'll surely turn me into a toad this time" followed by a heavy sigh.
~
E
trip~
Suddenly Stuart, not able to see the ground before his feet due to the
armload of supplies, trips.  It is some moments before he manages to
disentangle himself from the sprawling mass of parchments and supplies
which he even now begins to recollect.
~
E
ohno~
Suddenly Stuart's eyes go wide and all color drains from his face.  "Oh
no, the mugwort, I forgot the mugwort again!" he cries with dismay then
promptly he runs off.
~
E
spell~
You over hear Stuart contemplating some mystic equation.  It sounds as if
he's saying something like "...the innate arcane balance of germander
and its quasi-elemental effects...  water I think...  and the catalytic
alignment of Thormod's node with the..  yes, the proper phase...." He
trails off in contemplation.
~
E
cauldron~
Stuart seems to be going over some mental list verbally.  "...scrub the
cauldron free of rust, pick fresh hellebore, water the new strain of rose
seedlings...  ah and can't forget the freshly pressed robes from the
cleaners".
~
E
eye~
Stuart seems to be verbally going over a list he has either in hand
somewhere or in his head.  "...eye of newt, got it.  sack of flint, got
it.  tongue of tromp, got it though I still don't know what for.  pickled
hen's toes, hmm...  better run by Pennan real quick."

The first and most noticeable feature about this spirit is that it looms
nearly seven feet tall and seems to fill the chamber.  Even though he is
non-corporeal, his features are distinct.  He has long blond hair
which is bound in the back by a silver, seashell clasp and intense, sea
green eyes.  And while in life his human face might have been considered
handsome, his features are twisted and angry.  The spirit still
appears to be wearing a long, regal red robe fastened at the waist by a
red leather belt.  Also, emblazoned on his forehead is a golden crest.

Though humanoid, this non-corporeal spirit has several unusual features. 
His skin is bright pink and his eyes bulge outward to twice their normal
length and size.  On his right arm he has a large, chitinous claw and his
left hand is missing its thumb.  When taken altogether, the spirit's mix
of features makes him look like a cross between a human and an angry red
lobster.

Perhaps a couple inches taller than the average dwarf, this angry spirit
is mostly humanoid.  In addition to its humanoid features, the spirit's
left hand ends in a red, chitinous claw that matches its ruddy pink skin
tone.  Stocky in build, the spirit has thick legs and a wide torso. 
Aside from his crab-like features, the humanoid spirit's non-corporeal
form has one other, unusual feature: it has no eyes.

This humanoid spirit is a bizarre cross betweeb a crab and a human.  The
spirit has the upper and lower body of what you might see on a tall and
yet stocky human.  However, both its feet and hands end in crab-like
claws.  Not only that, but the spirit's left eye bulges several inches
out of its head, until it is less of an eye and more of an eye on an
eyestalk.  The spirit's other eye is perfectly normal, like a human's
eye, save that it glows with a burning orange hatred.

Five feet tall and extremely robust, in life this incorporeal spirit's
bulk must have been a force to reckon with.  The creature's visage and
skin are red in color and its features are a vague mix of human and crab. 
It has claws where it might have had hands, very little facial or body
hair, and its entire upper body, except for its jaws and eyes, are those
of a crustacean.  A thick plating of chitin encircles its chest.

lobster-claw hands, the spirit's prehensile appendages are just
oversized hands with four digits.  Also, its eye stalks are much shorter
and more primitive-looking than most living crabmen possess.  The crabman

Part crab and part human, the creature before you is clearly a spirit as

scurry about nervously.  The spirit's eyes brim with uncommon
intelligence even while his face contorts in an angry snarl.

Wavering like a reflection cast in a rippling pond, the visage of this
spirit before you shifts and twists.  Roughly five feet tall, the spirit
has the lower body of a well-built human warrior and the upper body of a
giant sea crab.  Though incorporeal, you can see that the crabman spirit
is clearly agitated.  Its eye stalks are moving in a frenzy of patterns.

Standing about five feet tall, this crabman looks a lot more stolid than
its kin above.  With muscular legs and two large, serrated, pinching
claws, the crabman has a serious look to his crustacean features.  His
red, chitin-plated upper body is extremely pale, probably from lack of
exposure to sunlight.  Strangely, though, his eye stalks are only half
extended and are glazed over, as if the guard were not entirely 'there.'

Standing before you is a rippling mass of muscle, scales and thick skin. 
This demon stands at a height of eight feet with a dusky grey colored
skin.  Wings too small to carry it in flight poke up over its shoulders,
framing its horned head in perfect manner to show off the malevolent grin
adorning its face.  It is clear this creature was built for battle: its
scaled forearms end in blade-like protrusions while its long whipping
tail ends in a deadly spike.  Both of its hands and feet end in gleaming
dark talons, each slightly curved to enhance the pain its victim receives.

This greenish skinned serpent is nearly six feet long from mouth to tail
tip.  Its green skin has yellowish speckles covering it, perhaps
obtained due to the high sulfuric content of the waters that it calls
home.  Rows of glistening fangs fill its mouth, set just before what
appears to be yet another weapon of the k'sskian: large glands that
contain a highly acidic poison.

Wavering like a reflection cast in a rippling pond, the visage of this
spirit before you shifts and twists.  Roughly five feet tall, the spirit
has the lower body of a well-built human warrior and the upper body of a
giant sea crab.  Though incorporeal, you can see that the crabman spirit
is clearly agitated.  Its eye stalks are moving in a frenzy of patterns.

A giant of a creature stands before you.  Nearly thirteen feet tall from
horn to foot, it is truly impressive.  Red flecks shimmer slightly on its
deep black hide, acting in a horrid mimicry of the stars burning in the
midnight sky.  Smoldering crimson eyes lock on to you as it moves, almost
giving the impression that its eyes alone could devour you.  Both its
hands and feet end in serrated talons and its mouth is filled with
glistening, six inch long fangs.  While only a lieutenant in the demon
armies, this is not a creature to mess with.

Grayclaw~

The protectorate to Object,~
~
meancingly glowers at you.~
~
~
~
~
Toughened and scarred by thousands of years of often life-threatening
service, Grayclaw is the loyal protectorate of the mighty deity Object.
Part wolf, part dragon, this powerful, ironic beast is the last member of
a race of guardians created eons ago by the gods to serve
unflinfhingly at the sides of their liege for all eternity.

Grayclaw stands four feet at the back, with a round, protruding skull and
powerful, leathery forearms as its most striking features.  despite its
apparent apathetic behavior, and eyes lackluster enough to belie
lethargy, this beast has at its command a razor sharp intellect with
teeth and claws to match. Add to this an unflappable sense of
determination and a remarkable knack for detecting the unobvious, and one
can quickly gain an appreciation for why this legendary creature has a
reputation for never giving the opportunity to provoke it twice.

overly thin, the woman looks to be both nimble and deft in every movement

The creature so closely resembles a newt that that's all it could be,
except its the size of a large dog!  Other mutations are also quiet
evident, perhaps due to generations of evolution in the polluted
environment of the sewers.  Among them is a third eye set in the
forehead, extra wide webbed feet, and a peculiar set of ridged spines
running along either flank.

To say that this doll-like creature looks strange is an understatement. 
It smiles wildly at you through diamond-shaped buttons, which are its
eyes.  Covering its entire face, except for those eyes, is a light blue
mask with red dots encircling its cheeks.  Flowing from the top of its
head are orange woolen strands.  Covering most of its body is a
combination of bright blue circles and a plaid design, giving off a odd,
contrasting appearance.  Its hands look proportionally larger than its
body, and its feet are almost as long as its fluffy legs.

not that well known, yet.  Anyway, Tireth and my twin sons had made a
quick trip to Sos-kul to investigate an odd darkness that had been
reported to the north of the city.  I asked Tireth to send someone else
for I had ill feelings about their endeavor.  When that failed I asked him
to not take our young ones with him.  Tireth said his famous lines of the
boys need to learn the ways of the world, and that was the last I have

~
are here, their banded bodies looking extremely hungry.~
This enormous wyrm is over sixty feet long, its segmented body colored in
alternating bands of red and gold.  Its large, black eyespots have been
filmed over by a thick green substance, but it looks accustomed to
feeling its way around.  Its entire body is coated in a green layer of
slime.  Thick hairs stick out where segments meet, and they seem to
provide movement for the beast.  Great fangs stick out from its mouth,
over a foot in length, and they are stained red with blood.  It must have
recently finished a meal.  Despite its size, its body moves with a silent
intensity, and from the looks of it the monster is very agile and supple.

This ivory-white animated pawn chess piece looks peculiar.  It has two

wide.  It stands a little over five feet tall, with a round, bulbous top,

Long, powerful arms extend from its sides, and two legs protrude through

Though transparent, this man retains much of the visage he must have had

About as big around as a small shield, this colorful arachnid makes no
threatening moves.  Its legs and body are covered in short, bristling red
hairs.  Most of its abdomen is also covered with white spots.  The red
and white spotted spider has four pairs of pale green, faceted eyes. 
Unlike some spiders, this one appears to be lacking both venom glands and
spinnerets.

Covered in a suit of shining chaimail armor, this dark faerie constantly

This large, muscular human is covered in several old scars from past
battles.  His stringy black hair is mottled and unkept.  Grasped tightly
in his hand is a serrated cutlass which glistens with fresh blood.  He
constantly squints as he peers down the tunnels looking for any sign of
intruders that would steal his well-deserved treasure.

canna~

Standing before you is a wild elf.  Almond-shaped eyes of a startling
turquoise drink in every detail of their surroundings.  She hardly seems
to blink as those large eyes survey the area, weighing and measuring
every detail for its potential threat or use.  Every hue of gold
imaginable twines in and around itself through a thick braid that hangs
past her waist.  Flawless ivory skin is made to seem even more pale by
the aura of darkness that shrouds her in perpetual shadow.  A wickedly
gleaming mithril half-moon arches elegantly from the dark ebon staff of
her pike, a weapon she carries with an easy familiarity.

Vivid turquoise eyes stare calmly out of a delicate ivory face, detailing
the area about them.  Soft golden blonde hair is swept back from her
temples into a vague crown, while the rest hangs free to her waist.  An
aura of shadow seems to surround her as she steps into the sunlight, soft
and flickering.  She stands taller than the wild elves, due to her
half-human ancestry, but with all the silence and dignity of her sylvan
forbears.  A slim-bladed longsword rests at her side, well-made and
gleaming, and she seems no stranger to its use.

Standing before you is a small human boy.  No older than five or six

out from a tousle of dirty blond hair, due to his faint traces of wild
elven blood.  Bright jade green eyes sit atop delicate cheekbones, while
a mischevious grin is never far from his lips.  Shifting his weight from
foot to foot, he seems about to burst into a flurry of motion.

This lizard is rather huge, despite its long, scaly tail.  Its tough,
thick skin is composed of olive green and deep purple scales that
sometimes glisten in the light.  Its head is pointy, and huge,
tired-looking eyes gaze out at its surrounding territory.  The
arrow-shaped tail is worth noting due to the royal blue color at its tip
which looks very sharp and dangerous.

Clearly human at one time, the ghost of a young human male hovers here. 
He is dressed in simply clothing, and though transparent, his skin
appears dark and tanned.  Numerous scars from burns decorate his arms
like badges of honor.  The ghost's eyes, which are a pale shade of blue,
look as if they hold half the world's sadness within their depths.

~
E
stat1~
It was in a cottage much like this one where my mistress worked her magic
with forging blades.
~
E
q1~
Alegra, my teacher, had a son who was skilled in battle even before I
came to her asking to be taught how to forge magic into blades.  In time,
we grew to be best friends.
~
E
q2~
On the eve of an important battle, I had just finished my best sword yet
- a small short sword with a tiger's head for a pommel.  I wanted so much
too impress Jergault and my teacher Alegra, that I snuck into his room
and switched the short sword his mother had given him with my own.
~
E
q3~
I knew for sure my sword was better.
~
E
q4~
My arrogance cost my friend his life.  He died on the battlefield when my
sword broke in his hand.
~
E
q5~
At once, Alegra knew her son was dead and came to tell me.  It was then
that she found the magic short sword she had given to Jergault to protect
his life among my belongings.  I tried to explain, but in a fury, she
drew her own magic blade and relieved me of my life.  I hoped my agony of
betrayal would end there.  But alas it did not.
~
E
q6~
I know not how long i drifted in the nothingness, but I came to find my
spirit unable to rest by my misdeed.  I stay here, in hopes that Alegra
will come back to the cottage and forgive me.
~
E
q7~
If you will agree to help me, I will be forever grateful.
~
E
doing~
Take the short sword of Alegra and cast it into the pool where the corpse
of Jergault was thrown.  It is said that the pond lies underneath a great
column of broken stone.
~
E
thanks~
I am forever in your debt for returning the short sword to my friend. 
Perhaps now his shade will forgive me and I will be able to find rest.

White Oak and Black Dove,
Had split their order intwain
One opted for peace and wisdom,
The other taught nothing but pain.
~
E

They decided to settle it one and for all,
So they met atop a hilly clearing,
Without warning the battle began,
Sending screams of war to all those in hearing.
~
E

With robes aglitter in fiery runes,
And a lightning bolt in each hand,
An unusal man with an 'E' on his robe,
Joined the good monks in their final stand.
~
E

But when the battle came to an end,
Only the White Oak monks remained alive.
They had made the sorceror both a member and a friend,
Even if he leaked wild combat magics like a sieve.

Lived a wise young woman,
With looks you'd not understand.

E

She had the mark of power,
Burned upon her chest,
In all its beauty,
It resembled the ruling crest.
~

But she had another destiny,
And practiced the arts of healing and alchemy,
So that if hurt ever came to her land,
She could heal it with the touch of her hand.

E

Like all her people, she lives alone.
Surrounded by the magic of the red desert sand.
And only with the proper teaching,
Can someone enter her people's land.

Not a soul truly does know.

Some say the valley perished,
Due to a drought or a blight.

Little did Endurus find,

But he passed on all his knowledge,
To his son before his final rest.

Dressed in flowing robes embrodiered with twining green ivy leaves, this
dwarven woman has long, thick side whiskers and cold, statue-like
features.  Her eyes, though, which are of a soft brown color matching her
robes, show tenderness and kindness.  Every inch of the dwarf's exposed
skin is covered with tattoos and emplems of nature and the elements.

The quasi-elementals are where the solid-elemental planes of earth, air,
fire and water come into contact with both the positive and negative
energy planes.
~
E

The eight quasi-elemental planes are over-seen by guardians - elemental
creatures made up of all the elementals.  And the guardians in turn are
kept in check by savants.  Overlords, so to speak, of the planes.

flour-covered,~
stand here, mixing some dough.~
Standing just under three feet, this small halfling girl is just barely
in her teens by human standards.  Her long, flowing black hair trails
down to her waist and is neatly tied with a pink ribbon.  Her large,
round violet eyes convey a sense of happiness and enjoyment from working
in her bakery.  She quietly hums a tune to herself as she mixes some
dough for the next batch of bread.

This trim gnome has quite a refined look about him.  His beard is trimmed
neatly and his hair is combed back into a pompador of sorts.  He is thin
for a gnome, which makes his round face and large nose look even larger. 
His black hair only shows a few sparse grey hairs, giving the only
indication of his age that you can see.

red line, like a trail of blood, can be seen on its stomach.  Even its
eyes, which are as black as coal, are cold-looking.  The serpent appears
to have two very large venom sacs running beneath its throat.

Moonstones, at least those which still have the power of the full moon,
are rarer than you might think.  I happened to find some once while
spying on some trolls in their warrens for a previous master, before I
got thrown in here.

Conjuring demons is tricky, but stealing the skin of one already on this

Making a belt such as this one is very draining for me.  But since you

regenerated properties from the demonskin and make a very useful belt.

stand here, ready to take your order.~
This young halfling woman is quite beautiful.  Her long blonde hair is
neatly tied back with silk ribbons.  Her violet eyes twinkle in the light
like a star in the night sky.  A broad smile seems imprinted upon her
face and never leaves it.  Her form is unlike other halflings due to the
fact that it is slender and her muscles are finely toned.

A lean figure of a dwarf he looks no thinner than your average well-fed

ashen-gray beard, tucked into his belt to keep it out of the way, speaks
of his advanced years.  Despite the spectacles perched upon his broad
nose, his eyes hold none of the rheumy stare of one losing their site,
rather they follow you with a keen interest in your every move.

This bear stands over 7 feet tall.  He towers above you in an
intimidating manner.  His teeth look large enough to bite you in half,
and his paws could kill with one swipe.  You shiver as he breathes on you;
his warm breath is offensive to the nostrils.  He is heading your way, so
either stand your ground or RUN!

This darkspawn is the reanimated remains of some poor soul, its body now
decomposed and reduced to a walking pile of bones.  Cold white light

or hunger.  Moving with a speed and grace unnerving in such a creature,
its one goal seems to be nothing short of the destruction of all living
creatures.
