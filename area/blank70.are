The forest on this side of the trail seems strangely scarce and
downtrodden.  Small bits of what must have been shrubs and bushes are now
just sticks and twigs.  The soil here is mostly sand and fine dirt with
small tufts of grass that have somehow survived.  There is a road to the
east of here.

The area around you is nothing but a sordid collection of withered beauty. 
Twisted old vines and underbrush litter the area, making it difficult to
move.  The sandy soil that makes up the lifesblood for these plants
makes it quite difficult to thrive.  You may move in any direction from
here.

On this, the western side of the Old Forest Trail, the soil has a large
sand content, consistent with that of the trail.  Old, twisted pieces of
rotten vines and dead underbrush litter the area around, making for a
quite desolate picture.  Small pebbles lie strewn all around the area
here.  You can move in any direction, and there is a road to the east.

The way becomes hard to follow here, mostly because of the scraggly vines
that seem to be grabbing at you from the ground.  Small insects seem to
crawl into tiny pits and crevasses in the sandy soil that dominates the
area.  You may move in any direction here, provided the underbrush
allows you to.  There is a road to the east of here.

Looking around you, nothing else is to be seen except ugly brown vines
and wilted black shrubbery.  The occasional insect is the only sign of
life that you can find around here.  To the north, you can see the tops
of a few trees poking upwards towards the dark sky.  You can move in any

The small scrub that you have been walking through comes to an abrupt

brush that remains around is withered and broken, and much of it is
completely without leaves of any kind.  The stratified rock paints a
beautiful picture against the horrid ground that you have grown
accustomed to travelling on.  You may continue to the north or east.

Scrub Brush~
This area looks to have once been rich in animal and plant life, but is
now devoid of such.  Old, dead vines and grasses litter the area here,
mixed in with a few small animal bones.  The gritty soil hides some of
the underbrush and bone matter here, leaving only a few small pieces
poking through.  Once rumored to have been the most beautiful forest in
the realm, this is now nothing.

The gritty soil runs into a solid stone wall to the south of here.  Small
bits of grass and other debris poke out from under the rock formation,
but are still struggling to survive, most likely for lack of water.  You
may proceed in every direction except south, where the rock has made the
way impassable.

Scrub Brush~
The thin brush that you have been making your way through gives way to a
large rock formation that forms a corner at this point.  The soil is
almost completely sand and fine pebbles mixed with the remnants of what
looks to have been vines and grass.  You may move north and east.

The brush that you have been walking through comes to an abrupt halt at
the rock shelf that rises up to the west here.  The beautiful hues of
brown and yellow present in the rock are almost mesmerizing in the
patterns they form.  Small tufts of grass and debris poke out from under
the rock, barely staying alive.  You may proceed in any direction except
west due to the rock formation.

Scrub Brush~
The scraggly brush comes to an end here at a rock shelf that rises up to
the north and west.  You can see many small insects and tiny plant life
that seems to grow in the cracks in the rock.  This rock looks to be
impassible to the west and north.

A Tree~
The view from the top of this tree is absolutely breathtaking.  To the
north, you can see the Cairn Mountains rising it their regal splendor,
and you can make out the road leading up to them.  You can see the tops
of other trees around you, and you suddenly realize that you are higher
up that you originally thought.
