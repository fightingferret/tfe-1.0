Outside the Graveyard of Lost Souls~
To the south, a large black iron gate offers entrance to the
long-abandoned Medienne Cemetery.  The gate's hinges are rusty and creak
softly in the wind.  A path leads up a slope to the north, leading toward
the Medienne town wall before turning east.
~
[Conner] A skeleton resets out here because the zone 'leaks.' -- It's on purpose
[Cynthia] I kinda like the name "Graveyard of Lost Souls" better than "Medienne Graveyard" ... feel like changing the area name just because of the opinion of a mortal? :)

gate~
The gate stands well over 12 feet high.  It is made of iron and is
painted midnight black.  The hinges are rusting and cobwebs cover the
majority of the surface.  The gate handle is in the shape of a demon's
head.  
You must put your hand in the mouth to open it.
~
E
demon head~
A long, oval shaped head forms the handle to the gate.  The ears are
pointed, the nose is long and thin and the cheek bones pertrude from the
face.  The face is black, but somehow the narrow slits, one might call
eyes, are darker still.  The mouth is open as if he is shouting an
epithet at you and sharp fangs protrude out from underneath the thin black
lips.

    "Enter at your peril."@n

With that, the image of the spectre fades away.

Graveyard of Lost Souls -- Inside the Gate~
Age-old trees with gnarled limbs intertwined form a latticework of
branches overhead that blots out the sky and allows only a grey,
unfocused light through to illuminate worn and broken headstones, some
sunken nearly to the point of exposing the resting dead below.  Glimpses
can be had of leaf-covered, weed-choked paths winding through the area,
and it is easy to see that few among the living have walked here in
recent years.

Undisturbed Ground~
The grass here has grown to waist height, brushing against the legs of
anyone walking through the area.  The gravestones here are almost
completely obscured by the grasses, but the few that can be seen seem
fairly old and largely undisturbed.  To the east stands the heavy black
iron fence that borders the cemetery.

Unlike much of cemetery further to the west, the ground and graves here

The fence is a blackened, wrought iron, twisted into vine and leaf

however, is the image that the cemetery is surround by a black, thorny,
iron hedge.

Mist and Memories~
The area here is misty, with vision hardly possible past a few feet, even
in the daylight hours.  A thick but prematurely shorted tree overshadows
an old grave marker here, fashioned in the shape of a youthful, almost
cherubic angel.  Both the tree and the marker appear very old.  The outer
black iron fence of the cemetery lies to the east.

Standing beneath a stunted juniper tree, a stone angel stares heavenward
with hollow, carven eyes.  Mist lies all about the figure, and has
condensed in small droplets on its upturned face.  Every so often, a drop
grows heavy enough that its own weight pulls it down the cheeks of the
image, giving the impression of a softly crying young girl, staring to the
skies imploringly.

At the Foot of a Hanged Man~
The only movement in this area is the slow sway of a useless, frayed rope
shifting slightly in the wind as it hangs from the branch of a tree that
sits in the very corner of the cemetery, just where the fence to the east
meets the one to the south.
~
[Conner] Legends say that a mandrake grows naturally only in the ground 'at the feet of a hanged murderer'. You can get a mandrake here, but only if you do everything in the right order.

Graveyard of Lost Souls -- Dark Canopy~
Close-set trees, their upper branches intertwined, form a thick canopy
overhead -- reinforced by vines and dead foliage, until no more than a
mere hint of light can seep through from above.  The eastern edge of the
cemetery is already lost in shadows, indistinguishable from the gloom.

The air is cold and dry, the whole area suffused with a light, diffuse

Footsteps in this area fall with cracks and crunches, instead of the

A winding, faint path weaves its way through the area, sparsely populated

revealing a long-untended path.  Piles of muck and trash have accumulated
against the heavy black fence to the north.

Nothing more that a twisted, ruined trail following the northern fence,
the path continues it torturous journey through the area.  The dark,
looming fence to the north is far less than a straight line here, forcing
its way into the bends of the path.  Here and there, a crumbling grave
stone reveals itself, lost remains of an orderly area rendered unusable
over time, the broken shapes slowly melting in the distance.  Oppression
hovers in the air like an ancient, dusty shroud.

Whispers and Dreams~
Shadows flit just on the edge of your vision, though the wind is still
and you see nothing that might cause any movement.  This whole area seems
alive, in fact, crawling with shadows from no apparent source, sighing
with whispers that your mind wants to make wind in the trees, but which
your heart knows as half-heard voices... the whispers of ghosts.

Overgrown Garden~
This place seems to have once been a small herb garden, perhaps having
something to do with the dilapidated old building directly to the west. 
Now, however, the place has gone almost completely to weeds: once neat
rows are overgrown, thyme and rosemary mixed with thick, coarse grasses
and nightshade. A heavy iron fence stands to the south.

This seems to be fairly near the center of the cemetery.  To the east

of some sort of chapel, probably long abandoned, while to the west --
obviously the oldest portion of the cemetery -- stand several large
mausoleums, probably belonging to some of the wealthier Medienne families.

Shattered Chapel Courtyard~
You survey a small open courtyard, strewn with rubble from a demolished
fountain, one of the few remnants of a small abandoned chapel that lies
just to the south.  The area was once paved with flat, gray flagstones,
now shattered and broken, stray weeds and wayward wildflowers nudging
through each dirt-filled crack.  Beyond the ruined fountain lies a small,
derelict chapel, its stonework and statuary tilted at crazy angles.

Along the Northern Fence~
To the west is a solid, unyielding mausoleum, almost out of place among
the fallen gravestones and black, uneven fence to the north, remnants of
a forgotten past.  The dirt trail winds both east and west, but is
obviously rarely travelled.

Before an Ancient Crypt~
Just to the west lies the heavy door of a large mausoleum constructed
in a very old style.  Tall weeds and grass wave here in a chill breeze
that does not blow quite strongly enough to dissipate the scent of decay
drifting from the crypt.
~
[Marek] The crypt west of here is an old section that someone took out to put in a back gate... I lost the gate, redesced this, and put it back in... didn't used to be there, so You've pry not seen the ghouls before.

The path here winds along through the trees to the north and south. 
Scents of dank earth and loam ride the chill breeze and carry muffled,
unidentifiable sounds to you on occasion.  Light rarely reaches the
ground here, and the area seems somehow washed out and drained of color.

Twisted trees mar the jagged skyline with desperately reaching fingers,

final release of death.  Grass and weeds wave in the stirring air, and
all about are misty forms, flitting from tombstone to tombstone, evading
your searching eyes.

A freshly opened - or re-opened - grave has disgorged black soil in a
mound over the converging paths here like a man who could not stomach
what he had been fed.  Ghostly, half-seen shapes can almost be seen in
the shifting light, drifting eerily among the trees, a sense of
foreboding lying heavy on the souls of those that venture here.

Within the Tomb~
The dry air here is stale, touched with a faint scent of death and decay. 
The walls around you lie cloaked in shadow, their surfaces unmarked and
unchanged by the passage of years -- utterly indifferent to your presence.

Within the Tomb~
This area is thick with the smell of death and waste -- obviously fouled
by the crypt's more recent inhabitants.  The room is fairly large, with
exits to the south and east, and looks as though it was once a family
crypt.  All of the family remains were 'disposed' of long ago, however.

Crypt of the Starkadders -- Dark Stairway~
Vaulted chambers spread out from the dark stairway here that rises to the
cemetery above.  The hall is lined with many side chambers, some of the
epitaphs still visible on the lintels.  Indeed the stonework here seems
ancient, some possibly predating the current city itself.  The odor of
decay dominates here, hanging in the still, dusty air.

murals~
The paintings here depict a knight dedicated to defending his leige from
threats on all sides -- a duty which has apparently earned him a place of
high honor within the crypt.  The mural on the west side of the room
seems to be painted to resemble some sort of infernal door.  Upon closer
inspection, it seems that the mural may be more than a mere picture of a
door, after all.

The murals here are horrid depictions of rites and practices in which,

A Dark Staircase~
The staircase curves down into the darkness, and ends above you in a
heavy stone door.  As you keep downward, the air gets thicker and more
musty.  This place does not seem to accept the tread of living feet

Bottom of Dark Staircase~
Deep shadows fill the area, creating a sense of foreboding, a sort of
hushed noise that the crypt itself seems unwilling to break.  Colored
murals, once asture and dignified, have grown dull and filthy, barely
discernable; the once radiant gilt-work and carvings are now nearly
crumbled away.  Heavy stone doors are set into the walls to the east,
west and south, and a simple spiral stair rises from the center of the
room to the world above.

Within the Ancient Crypts~
The stonework here is far older and cruder than in the rest of the Crypt. 
The stone-setting itself is more primitive, and it seems likely that this
is the original construction that was built onto later by the Starkadder
clan following the colonization of Medienne.  It's surprising that these
walls are still standing, in fact, as they do not seem very sturdy
anymore.
~
[Merior] is this replacing the black sash that used to load upstairs?
-- No, these wear to the same location as a tabbard -- to the primitive
tribes, that's basically what they were -- also, they don't do the same
thing.

stone-carving artistry that you've seen along these ancient paths.

Vaulted chambers spread out to the west and south from this dark
entrance, pillars rising up like rotting trees, fading into the darkness
a few yards distant.  The stonework here seems ancient, probably
predating the current city itself.  The odor of wetness and decay
dominates here, hanging in the still, thick air.  Shadows dance around
the area as your light flickers off the water that lies, still and dark,
as far as can be seen through the shadows to the south and west.

Ancient Catacombs~
The floor is entirely covered with a few inches of standing water.  The
horrible stench in the water enough to keep any normal creatures away,
the smell of it like a concentration of every evil thing that walks the
earth of this crypt.  To the east and west, the floor is dry, but only
water can be seen between the pillars to the north.

Cold and Dry~
Although cold and basically unpleasant, this hall is at least dry.  The
stonework of the walls and floor is cut in the same crude style found in
the rest of these catacombs, and dust covers the unadorned walls and
floor.  The passage continues to the south, and a simple stone door is

A Chilling Turn~
The temperature in this passage is almost unnaturally cold, even for an
underground hallway of carved stone.  The stones here are rough-set and
unmortared, and the whole area is caked with a layer of semi-crusted dust. 
The passage leads to the north and west.

Chamber of the Well~
This rough circular chamber looks oddly out of place in the midst of a
burial catacomb.  Set directly in the center of the chamber is the low
lip of an open well, which seems to be the source of the shockingly cold
air in the room.  An open archway leads out of the room to the east, and
a heavy wooden door is set into the western wall.

Rest of the King~
Carved roughly, but showing much more effort than other areas of this
ancient abandoned crypt, this room looks as much like a throne room as it
does a mausolem.  Across from the entrance, a huge throne stands on a
dais beneath an ancient heraldic tapestry, on which sits the dessicated
frame of a long-dead, or a least long-buried, barbarian king.

A Simple Hall~
Despite its solid design, this is a simple hall, the walls no more than
ten feet across.  With little else to look at, your attention turns to
the apparently unmortared walls.  The walls are made of heavy stones
carefully laid without so much as a gap for a knife blade to fit in
the cracks, even after time has taken its toll.

All sounds have a muted air here, as if uneasy fear has taken on a

The walls of this chamber are carved from dark granite, the floor smooth,

Leaning, Cracked, and Broken~
The chill, stone walls lean in towards you, allowing you passage only to
the east and west.  The footing is uneven here, the once-fine stonework
of the floor now buckled and cracked.  The passage continues to the east,
where the floor grows smoother, and the west, where, if anything, it
worsens.

Close Quarters~
The finely crafted granite walls are smeared with old blood and raked by... 
it looks like someone took a weapon to them.  Tattered clothing, crushed
bones, and shattered armor and weaponry lie on the floor in an odd sort
of piled ridge that runs from the door right across the room to the far
wall, almost as though the things were swept there by a giant broom. 
An inscription is carved into the far wall, just above a small opening.

[Marek] Do NOT edit the acodes while the code is running, or it breaks everything. (Yeah, big surprise, Imm powers can break the code... passwall screws it up too.

Walls of dusty stone form the corridor around you.  Murals line the

Chill Air~
The corridor runs east and west here, and the air is cold enough to let
you see your own breath.  The pillars here are oddly mismatched with
the rest of the granite stonework -- they seem to be a marble of some
sort, black, striated, with a dark red vein.

The pillars here are constructed of an oddly colored marble you have not

Nearing the End~
Patterns are carved all along the walls here in a heavy maze of
engraving, and pillars of black granite stand to either side, your silent
companions throughout this exploration.  The floor is level, fairly
clean, and unfortunately offers little in the way of a good grip for your
feet.

engraving maze carved carvings patterns~
The carved patterns in the wall seem to be some sort of ritualistic
imagery that progresses from the east end of the hall to the west.  Most
of the symbols are impossible to make out, but a few are obviously
referring to sacrifice of life in the pursuit of some greater power.

Smooth as glass and much much harder, you can't tell if the floors are

get off the slick surface before something shows up to test your balance.

End of the Journey~
The hallway ends to the west in a dark, polished stone door set with many
runes.  The floor and walls are polished here where all other things are
covered in grime, the walls engraved with what appear to be ancient
heirophantic symbols.  A biting cold that goes straight to the core of
your being radiates from the western portal.

Ageless and Entombed~
Carved beautifully, with an attention to detail that shames even the
finest living noble houses, this room is nothing less than a throne room,
and there are signs that the occupant hopes to attain even more.  A large
but plain throne stands on a dais across from the entrance, upon which
sits the earthly form of the creature once known as the archimage
Croazner.

Like the rest of the catacombs, this area is noxious in a way that
suggests that nothing which enters here could remain clean for long: even
the frost that forms on the walls and pillars seems dingy.  The way to
the south might be somewhat less submerged, although it's difficult to
tell from here.  To the west the shadow of a blocking wall can barely be
made out.

huge area, but the air is still.  Burial slots are sealed up along these
walls, their contents safe from raiding.

[Lani] When you look at the slot, wall is misspelled.
[Fyli] look slot misspells wall.

Ancient Catacombs~
Quiet ripples shimmer over the water.  Thin and wispy cobwebs hang down
from the ceilings above, a chill breeze slipping through the pillars and
about you with whispering sighs.  The catacombs stretch out in all
directions from you, as does the water that rises up to your waist.

Ancient Catacombs~
Mysterious, vague shadows flicker through the area, heightening feelings
of insecurity, as if the catacombs themselves take exception to intrusion. 
The darkness here assumes a life of its own, black cast upon unrelieved
black.  You may wade through the murky catacombs to the north, east and
south.

Ancient Catacombs~
The water's depths swirl coldly around your feet, dark and chill.  The
submerged floor makes the ceiling seem even higher, the pillars taller
and more ominous in their looming.  The general feeling is that of your
own insignificance in the face of these ancient stones.

To the south, the floor rises above the waterline, but here it is as deep
as most of the rest of these half-flooded chambers.  Lights show little
more than water to the north and east, and cobwebs hanging from the
ceiling, white and wispy.

Ancient Catacombs~
The quiet of the area is occasionally broken by the sounds of things
unseen moving through the darkness.  Ancient pillars stand around you,
blocking all but the briefest glimpses of the surrounding area.  To the
east and west, the floor is relatively dry, but to the north only the
shimmer of water can be seen.

The pillars loom all about you, making you feel as though you stand in
the midst of a tight tree grove on the edge of a dismal, evil swamp.  The

Ancient Catacombs~
The floor here is higher than most of the rest of the catacombs, and thus
above the level of the water by a few inches.  The floor is strewn with
cast-up garbage and loose stones, but it is altogether more comfortable
than being hip-deep in cold water.  All about you stand pillars like
sentinels, blocking your view after no more than a few dozen feet.

Frozen Hall~
The temperature in this passage remains at the near freezing levels of a
mountain pass, obviously unnatural even for this place.  The walls are,
in fact, crusted with a fine layer of frost, and seems to have been that
way for a very long time.  The passage leads to the east and west.

Pit of the Crypt Dweller~
The water is thick with dirt and garbage, sight is almost impossible in
this murk.  The liquid gets in your eyes and mouth, forcing you to
suppress a powerful gag reflex.  The only way out of here is by swimming
up to the surface, but you can see even in this murk that tentacles from
the crypt dweller curl all around the opening.
~
[Merior] are tentacles there when mob is dead?
[Marek] yeah, they've sorta half grown into the walls in places... like tree roots.
