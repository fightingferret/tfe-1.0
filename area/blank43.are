Before a Dark and Sinister Portal~
An immense, featureless portal dominates the chamber's north wall. 
Otherwise, the room is bare, save for a thin lever, its wooden handle dry
and slightly warped with age.  All about you, the stone surfaces which
surround you are smooth and seem to be joined together effortlessly, 
their edges perflect flush with one another.

Corners Small and Forgotten~
You find yourself in a humble chamber, with finely-fitted stones covering
the walls, floor and ceiling.  As you examine them, you notice their
startlingly close fit with their neighbors, and the thick layer of dust
which covers them in their unfeeling, unending slumbers.

Before the Darkness~
A large stone chamber opens up around you, its walls and floor
constructed with strangely-shaped, smooth stones.  The ceiling above you
looms high, the darkness overhead undaunted by your feeble light source. 
A steep ramp constructed from the oddly-shaped flagstones descends further
into the depths below, creeping its way downward along the chamber's
southern wall.

A immense, jagged cave opens up around you.  The floor is made from the
smooth, finely-joined stone characteristic of the areas above you; the
walls and ceiling, however, are rough and unfinished.  A smooth stone
ramp makes a steep ascent into darkness along the east wall.

Afoot on the Dark Stone~
The finely-joined stones create a flawless plane here, at the foot of a
stone ramp leading up a steep incline.  Aside from the smooth stone
surfaces of the stone ramp, which climbs the west wall up and out of
sight, the floor beneath you is the only other finished surface around
you.  Everywhere else, jagged stone outcroppings and rough stone
surfaces dart here and there, opening up to reveal a huge natural
cavern all around you.

Beyond Time and Memory~
This chamber is long and narrow, having been tunneled from the bare, dull
rock of the hills.  The ceiling here is arched and low, forcing you to
stoop over as you move about.  The fine stonework present elsewhere in
the complex is unfinished here.  The customary strangely-shaped stones
only rise a foot or so above floor level here, construction having been
apparently suspended due to some unknown cause.

To the north, the remains of Pennan's stone curtain rest in an uneasy
slumber, indifferent to your momentary scrutiny.  A thicket of tangled
trees and brush grows to the east, along the spit of land between the
remains of the wall and the creek known as the Valewash which flows by to
the south.  Peering west, you spy a tight grove of ancient pine trees
which rise high above the rest of your surroundings, their darkish,

Among the Silent Pines~
Stately, dark boughs rise to meet one another in an arboreal embrace,
their lofty curves creating a living vault of branches in the shadowy,
still air overhead.  Underfoot, the dry pine needles carpet the cool,
level ground underneath.  Several large white stone boulders lie against
one another near the base of a great pine.  Upon second glance, you
realize that they come together to form a crude altar.

Creeping vines hang down from atop a stone cliff which runs west to south

The pines stand impassively here, silent and somehow able to brook your
presence amongst their ageless, towering forms.  Large strands of a dark,
sticky substance span the gaps between several trunks here, forming a
giant web.

Damp Caves~
The watery cave makes its way between several large rock formations,
forcing you to inch carefully between their odd protrusions and slick
surfaces.  Up above you, you sense another open space, and think you can
detect scores of stalagmites and stalagtites littering the distant
cavern, but the climb up a sheer, wet cavern wall is clearly beyond the
realm of possibility.

The wide tunnel has a more or less level floor, although uneven

The crude mound of rocks is formed of large, mostly flat, rocks and
boulders.  The heap seems largely unstable, but with a little caution it

indeed its intended purpose.

The dark soil of the packed earth overhead rests at an angle, as if
whoever dug the rather large burrow was trying to approximate some sort
of arch or dome.  A narrow rift provides access to a tunnel that looks to
lead further up, perhaps to the surface.  A slight breeze of fresh air
wafting down from the ceiling lends further credence to the possibility.

The dark soil of the earth, crumbling in places, forms the walls of this

preventing an imminent cave-in in some places.  Rusty sconces are
sporadically mounted to the support braces, although none of them hold
torches now, and a few even hang at odd angles where bolts have
completely rusted through.

Ancient Tunnel~
Three wide tunnels form a T-intersection where a tunnel from the south
dead-ends into an east-west running tunnel.  The intersection is
reinforced by several stout wooden beams that brace the arched ceiling in
place, greatly decreasing the chance of a cave-in.  Brackets, thick with
rust, are bolted to the support beams and probably once held torches for
the miners who once worked these now-dark tunnels.

Ancient Guard Post~
This juncture of tunnels was widened significantly and seems to serve as
a large room of sorts.  The smashed remains of a chair and what looks
like a table are scattered haphazardly about the floor.  In place of the
ravaged furniture, several large rocks have been arranged to serve as
seats.  A few ratty scraps of cloth and bedroll in one corner seems to
serve as some sort of bedding where the cave's occupant can catch some
sleep in an off moment.

A square stone table dominates the room as its centerpiece with two crude

Cistern~
A stone fountain dominates the southern portion of this tunnel as it
widens into a small room.  Several support beams insure that a cave-in
will not occur, cutting off this spring-fed water supply.  Several
planks of wood are nailed across the supports just over the fountain to
keep the stray clod of dirt and rock from falling into the cool, clear
water.  Though the walls of the cave are nothing more than dirt, it looks
as if the dirt has been packed tight to prevent it from crumbling.  The
only appearant means of exit seems to be the wide tunnel leading
northward away from the fountain.

Extra support beams reinforce the widened cave once providing a

Forest - Beech Woods~
Scores of beeches grow overhead here, forming a thicket which bristles
near the edge of the riverbank.  To the north and west, the woods thicken
as the ground rises and falls with the undulating curves of the wooded
hills.  The air here is cool and still, but you sense the soft, telltale
breeze of the river air off to the southeast.

Forest - Beech Woods~
The woods thin out here, with spaces between the beech trees where one
can easily look and find an unobscured patch of sky.  To the east, you
see tufts of snarled grass grow along the lip of the riverbank, while
north and west of here the woods seem to thicken, with a few oaks and
elms scattered in among the stands of beech trees.

The woods open up around you here, the ground damp and sloped, leading
downward slightly to the east.  What seems to be a large earthen mound,
exceedingly steep and covered with thorns and other vegetation, blocks
passage to the south.

Forest - Beech Woods, Slope~
The woods here open up into a few small clearings where tall stands of
grass eke out an existence.  The moss-covered remains of a wall snake
west to south here, while the ground rises and falls in great, ambulatory
ripples which suggest a subtle life to the forest of beeches which
envelops you.

An ancient stone wall towers over you to the south, connected to the

obscure your view.

The beeches here seem somehow older, as they cover the sloped,

appears to be a small structure to the northeast of here.

Forest - Rise in the Woods~
You stand on a small, mossy hillock in the beech woods.  A small shelter
stands in between several old trees to the east, only noticeable due to a
small sign posted out in front of the structure.  In all other
directions, the woods open up around you, their branches screening you
from the sky above.  To the northeast, the ground tumbles down toward the
dim, sleek shape of the Valewash as it flows through the woods, along the
floor of the Rua Valley.

The Hedge Wizard's~
Weathered branches intertwine to form a small shelter here, their gnarled
forms providing an ample if cramped space for scores of small potions,
powders and oddies collected from across the realms.  Its denizen a
practitioner of the many, varied lesser magical and mystical arts, you
can expect to find anything - and everything - among his wares.  Who he
follows and where he has come from is unknown, yet the hedge wizard has
remained here, for time untold.

Ancient Tunnel~
The wide tunnel gradually curves until it is no longer heading straight,
but rather heads north or east from here.  The support braces this deep
into the old mines are still in fair condition despite the obvious span
of time it has been since they saw any maintenence.  The brackets that
would have held torches in better times are less rusted here than in most
other parts of the mine, though some are just plain missing where they
had been bolted in before.

Ancient Tunnel~
The wide tunnel retains the gloom that is everpresent in the deep of the
earth.  Dark timbers form supporting braces that do little to enhance the
gloomy atmosphere of the caves.  A gentle curve brings the passage around
so that its exits face north and west rather than running in a straight
line.  A thin, nearly non-existent line of bright metal flakes embeded in
the wall show where a vein once ran and the probable reason for the
sinuous path woven by the tunnel.

Ancient Tunnel~
Thick wooden timbers form braces that help support the immense weight of
the rocks overhead.  Though the braces are starting to show signs of
sagging they look as if they could go a good while longer before they
would give in.  The stone of the walls is the dark color of fresh, loamy
soil though it remains much harder than the loose-packed soil it appears
to be.

The dark stone of the tunnel walls curves sharply, almost at a right
angle, following some directive only known to the miners and formen no
longer present.  Thick wooden beams, sagging under the weight of all the
heavy stone overhead, form braces that still manage to prevent the tunnel
from collapsing completely.  Small piles of rock rest against the wall
where passing feet have kicked them aside after falling in bits and
pieces from the ceiling.

The support braces are obviously all that is preventing a titanic cave-in

Ancient Tunnel~
The wide earthen tunnel splits to form a T-junction heading north, south
and west.  While the southern and western junctions lead off into the
total darkness common to the tunnels, the northern tunnel ends abruptly
in a solid wall of collapsed rock and shattered timber where the tunnel
finally caved in.  The support beams lining the southern and western
tunnels sag noticably and it is only a matter of time before they too
give in.
