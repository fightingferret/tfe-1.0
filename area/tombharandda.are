Before an Underground Archway~
You stand before a large shimmering, archway of granite, raising up to
the ceiling of the cavern.  It is inlaid with tiny bits of @b@Wmithril@n
around its curved, dusty surface in a strange pattern which seems to be
responsible for the shimmering, @Bblue-hued@n sheet of energy which fills
the arch.  An inscription is almost visible through the layers of dust on
the stone beside the arch.  A massive stairway leads up toward the
surface and out of the mountain.  Abandoned sconces on the walls hold
burnt-out torches which have long since ceased to light the chamber.
~
wipe dust to read inscription on stone
[Greyclaw] Am working on this action.
[Kanroc] what exactly does light the chamber?
[Aldric] need to see other people exit other than the tank.

Beyond an Underground Archway~
Your footsteps echo down the length of this long dusty hall, forgotten by
time, forgotten by the world above for generations.  To the south you see
a great granite arch, beyond which lies a staircase leading up and out of
the mountain tomb.  To the north the hall continues into the very heart
of the Cairn Mountains.

A Long Dark Hall~
The hard granite walls reverberate every sound, causing the echos of your
footsteps to linger in the shadows for quite some time.  To the south the
faint glow of a towering archway can be seen, while the darkness
continues to the north.  The cold stone floor has a decidedly downward
slope, leading deeper and deeper into the mountain.

A Long Dark Hall - Intersection in the Darkness~
The cold, dark, forgotten hallway leads down into the very bones of the
earth to the north, into an impenetrable darkness which your light source
cannot illuminate.  Side passageways lead east and west, but their
destinations are not clear as the floors blend into shadow.  To the south
you can barely make out a shimmering arch of blue energy.

This chamber stretches beyond the reach of torchlight to the east and

ceiling.  A dark tunnel leads away from the chamber to the south and a
large metal door is inset in the north wall.  Cobwebs stream across the
room, a thick blanket which blocks vision as a dense fog.

Above a Staircase~
To the south a great mithril door rises above the cold granite floor,
leading south toward the Upper Tomb.  A chiseled staircase leads even
deeper into the mountain tomb below, the darkness making the stair seem
endless.  The stair starts downward to the north but twists away to the
east as it fades into shadow.

At the Base of a Staircase~
A staircase carved into the side of the tomb spirals upward into the
darkness of the upper level of the tomb, while to the east a large hall
continues away from the stair.  The ceiling vaults to about 100 feet
above you in this shadowy, cubical-shaped room.  It is not clear what the
purpose of this room is, as it is bare of anything save a few sconces on
the wall.  Perhaps it was the site of a ritual or ceremony, for as you
listen an echo from across the centuries seems to reach your ears.

A Long Dark Hall~
This wide, high-ceilinged hall's hard stone floor is unforgiving beneath
your feet, resounding an echo for several minutes after every step in the
air that perhaps has not been disturbed for many years.  To the west you
can make out a staircase through the darkness, and to the east you see
the main hall branch into two side tunnels.

A Long Dark Hall - Intersection in the Darkness~
The high-ceiling main hall of the middle tomb continues to the east and
west, while smaller tunnels lead north and south.  The unfathomable
weight of the Cairn Mountains lies directly overhead this far beneath the
surface, perhaps a thousand feet below the ground.  The air here is
chill, as is always the case at this depth, but something more strange
than nature adds to it.

You stand above a staircase which spirals down into the dark depths

staircase.

you stand before the lower tombs.  Something has been carved into the

From a quick look around there is not much which would lead you to
believe that this is the final resting place of a great warrior.  No
mounds of gold sit nearby, no troves of countless treasures adorn the

Room of the Keeper~
This small room is lit by the warm glow of a burning fire in an alcove to
the east.  While small, the room appears cozy, furnished with a bearskin
rug, a solid bed, and a small desk.  On the desk a large open book rests,
dust thick upon its pages.

Inside a Small Alcove~
The six and a half feet tall alcove is a surprisingly deep insertion into
the stone wall, enough so that the alcove seems to be constantly shrouded
in shadow.  This alcove was apparently the used as a burial chamber, as
the residues of embalming materials are intermixed with cobwebs across
the stone surface of the walls and floor.  You can leave the alcove to
the east.
