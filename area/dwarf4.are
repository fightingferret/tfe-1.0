Cave Entrance~
Though the outside of the cave looks natural enough you soon realise that
this is a tunnel and not a cave.  The walls and floor are much too
straight and level and the tunnel holds a true line to the east.  Snow is
blown in from out side and the wind, whistles across the mouth of the
cave making this quite a noisy place to stand.

Tunnel~
The tunnel continues a reasonable distance into the mountain.  The floor
and sides of the tunnel are too regular to be natural as it is holding to
quite a straight line.

Tunnel~
The tunnel gently slopes up to a heavy iron portcullis which has big
sharp iron spikes sticking out on this side.  The floor of the tunnel is
merely smoothed off rock.  The tunnel is actually quite wide still here
probably nearly twenty feet across.  In the darkness above you you notice
an array of small lights like stars at night.  
  
A newly painted sign is bolted to the wall.

Looking more closely, you now can make out what must be a well lit room

portcullis~
The portcullis is surberbly built.  It would take a serious amount of
magic or a big seige engine to break it.  There doesn't seem to be anyway

attention?

Tunnel~
The tunnel has enough room for about eight dwarfs to march side by side
and more than high enough for a dwarf to swing his axe.  To the west
there is a heavy iron portcullis protected by big sharp spikes and to the
east the tunnel opens up into a cavern of some kind.  The ground is
actually paved with a criss-cross pattern of stones though the sides and
roof of the tunnel are smoothly finished rock.  
    
Beside the portcullis is a large lever set into the wall.
~
[Banfiz] I do believe that the dwarfs in the room description should be dwarves.

Kha-da, Square~
This is part of the main square of Kha-da.  It is at the bottom of a
large sinkhole, in which you can see a number of levels above you as the
sinkhole rises up.  The floor throughout the square is paved with an
intricate pattern of criss-cross stones in two different shades of
brown. There are a number of peddlers here selling their wares.

This is the southern wall of the main square of Kha-da.  Along the wall
sit a number of dwarfs on low wooden benches.  Beside them sits a Clerk

is a single anvil set upon a simple stone plinth.
   
A large and ancient anvil rests on a plinth.

A tiny little tink resounds barely carrying its sounds beyond the range

Several nearby dwarves look your way with dumbfounded stares then quickly

A fair clank resounds from your mighty hammer blow upon the anvil.

Nearby dwarves glance your way barely concealing mirthful chuckles.  When
several whispers result in louder guffaws, you aren't so sure whether it
is in appreciation of your skill or lack thereof.  Maybe someone in town
could suggest a better hammer to use.

A loud clank resounds from your mighty hammer blow, echoing back from the

clap at your success, though others walk off without much more than a nod.

clang~
A resounding CLANG echoes throughout the halls and caverns of the

four directions from here, where you can see Dwarfs going about their
normal business and traders plying the available custom.  
   
A small fountain burbles with water here.

Tunnel~
Although the sides and roof are merely smoothly finished rock, the floor
is covered in a criss-crossing pattern of paving stones.  What you notice
most about the tunnel however are the three heavy iron gates in its'
length.  Just to the east of here the tunnel opens up into a temple.

Temple - West Wing~
Gold is all over this very large room.  The roof is gold, gold pillars
stand straight and tall, and gold statues line the sides of the hall. 
This is the west wing of a temple.  Many benches run in two aisles down
the length of the room.  To the east, in the center of the temple, is a
magnificent golden altar.  
   
There is a Newbie sign on the wall - Look Sign.

Welcome to Forest's Edge.  This is the Temple in the city of Kha-da home
of the Dwarfs of clan Khedrun.  In general there should be some equipment
and provisions here to help you get started, please don't keep on taking
them as you improve in level.  Type 'Help' to get you used to this Mud. 
Good places to start for low level characters is out the main gate, go
south and look out for a sign leading to the goblin caves.  There is a
bounty on Goblins so be sure to collect their ears.  If you get stuck you
can always 'chat' to everyone on the mud for some help.  
  
Happy hunting, and may your axe never dull,

Over on the west side of the room are large piles of smoothly rounded
rocks sorted out into piles according to size.  In the middle of the
south side of the room is a winch and a number of wicker baskets.  Below

the door is a small table behind which there is probably a clerk.

Hagar's Hall of Food~
The passage from the square opens up into quite a large hall.  There are
tables and benches along the north and south walls and enough places to
sit a hundred dwarfs easily.  The smell of mushrooms and fish wafts down
the hall from the far end where you can see some doors to what must be
the kitchen area.  Standing next to a counter by the entrance to the
square is a tubby dwarf.  Behind him there is a menu on the wall listing

Dragon-Slayer~
This is a bar dedicated to the honourable dwarven profession of Dragon
Slaying.  Since most dwarf heros have slayed the odd dragon or two it is
full of dragon scales, dragon teeth, other trophies so on.  Behind the
bar is an old battle-worn dwarf that looks like a dragon might have got
the better of him one day.  But as they say, any dragon you can walk away
from is a good dragon.  Along the walls are a number of dragon scales,
dragon teeth and other trophies.

Guard's Room~
There are a number of staunch guards sitting around a table playing cards. 
The room is otherwise fairly spartan though an iron grill in the west
wall covers what is obviously an armoury of weapons and other equipment. 
Another iron grill door in the north wall leads into a room with a number
of sorry looking dwarfs.  There is a sign above the door.  A water trough
has been placed in the center of the room for various personal pets to
drink from and rest in safety.

Glond's Armoury~
Set on stands are quite a number of different suits of armour.  Banded,
scale, chainmail, plate and so on.  If there is a certain type metal
armour ever made then it is probably here somewhere.  Then on the walls
of this shop are dozens and dozens of shields of different sizes and
shapes.

Damon Hill - Jeweler~
A U-shaped counter blocks, and only permits you a little way into this
shop.  Over behind the counter you can see a dwarf hunched over a desk
working on something small and intricate.  But what really catches your
eye are dozens of gems, rings and other jewelery on small velvet pads
sitting on shelves against the far wall.

Temple Centre, Altar~
Set up, on a circular dais is a completely golden altar, upon which is a
huge platter of gold coins, all polished and gleaming in the bright
light.  Beside the altar, set out in a square, are four golden
candlestick stands that must be about five feet tall.  Looking up, you
can see the ceiling covered in the golden relief of a dwarf battling with
a Dragon.  

A very large platter of shiny gold coins rests here, glimmering.

As you reach for the platter of coins the dwarven priest lets out a
bellow and several guards come running in and apprehend you.  The next

As $n reaches for the plate of gold coins the dwarven priests lets out an
enraged bellow.  Sudednly several dwarven guards rush into the room, see

The cell door opens just long enough for several guards to toss $n in,
then it slams shut and you hear the lock clicking shut again.

You reach for the gold coins only to find them turn to a dish of small
pebbles when you touch them.  Appearantly an elaborate illusion that has
effectively ensnared many a thief for the crafty dwarves of Kha-da.  I
wonder where they really keep their gold.  In the bank maybe?

Tunnel~
After a short passage through some very dark rock the tunnel opens up
into a huge box-like cavern.  The cavern is flooded and a still, dark
water fills the square sides of a cavern that must be at least 300 feet
square.  At the center of this cavern, a cube-like building rises from
the lake, crossing the lake to the building is a thin rickety bridge that
only looks like it's a few good axe swings away from being tumbled into
the water.  There are no paths around the side of the square cavern and
no paths around the outside of the building, both simply go straight up
out of the water.

Standing on the flimsy bridge you can see a cube-like building to your

the bridge provide the only light in this cavernous room.  To the north
standing on top of the building are a number of dwarf guards in heavy
plate mail.

1st Secure Bank of Kha-da~
You enter the building and find yourself in a smallish room with a number
of grilled tellers.  Armed guards stand both inside the building and
out.  The 1st Secure Bank looks very secure.  Opposite the teller stands
a bench with weighing equipment for measuring valuable objects.  The room
has a very somber and serious mood.

Covered in books, scrolls, jars, bubbling pots, and steamming cups this

The Young Dwarves' Carefull Assault school is a large room with lots of
large rocks tied to steel bars, dwarfs attacking wooden posts and the
smell of a strange pungent herb in the air.  Against one wall are racks
of blunted practice weapons and running down the side of the opposite
wall are a number of dwarfs, flat on their backs lying on wooden benches
lifting a steel pole with rocks tied to it, up and down repeatdley.

Marander's Cut Price Armour~
Armour and shields clutter the room, most of it is just dumped on tables
and none of it looks new.  Some of it even looks extremely well past
new.  The 'subdued' lighting gives the place a run down sort of feeling. 
You think the reason the lighting isn't too great is that the owner
doesn't want the blemishes and broken bits on the goods in the room to
show up.
