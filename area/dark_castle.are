Gate to Lag Graveyard~
You are now standing before a very large gate which does not seem to have
been used very much.  Beyond the gate, you can see a graveyard speckled
with headstones.  A mystical fog seems to be rolling in from the north. 
If you listen, the graveyard seems almost alive with a number of spirits,
each of which seems to be calling you to join them in the afterlife.

large gate~
Across the top of the gate, carved in wrought iron, is the single phrase,
'LAG CEMETERY'.  The gate itself, appears to be well constructed.  It
would be far easier opening it, than trying to wreck it.

A massive, iron gate.~
E
fog~
The fog surrounds you, hiding anything beyond a few feet away in a
swirling grey cloak.  Besides affecting vision, it seems to alter sound
as well, for you cannot tell where the noises you hear are coming from.
~
E
graveyard~
The graveyard appears quite normal at first sight.  The headstones seem
quite normal.  However, you think you see something moving inside the
graveyard, although you cannot be sure because of the accursed fog.
~
E
headstones~
The headstones are quite scattered, for as far as you can see.  Although
the fog is limiting your sight somewhat, you can see that some of the
headstones are not in very good shape.

Graveyard Path~
Standing just within the gate, you realize that your view of the entire
graveyard is blocked by several trees and a dense fog.  However, you can
see a few tombstones of different sizes and shapes to the north and
east.  To the west, you can see a small path with odd looking footprints
trailing through the graveyard.  A massive gate lies to the south.

The path seems to be poorly taken care of, but is still visible through
the fog.  The path goes to the west from here, but beyond that is hidden
by the fog.
~
E
footprints~
As you look at the path, you barely notice a set of footprints in the
grass of the path.  They do not seem to be normal footprints, however. 
More like that of an animal than a man.
~
E
tombstone tombstones~
Scattered around the graveyard are tombstones of various size and shape. 
Many of them are in a less than perfect state, with time and filth being
the major causes of destruction.
~
E
tree trees~
Although the fog blocks your view for the most part, some of the
graveyard is obscured by a few stunted and malformed trees.  The trees do
not appear to be altogether normal, and there is an unwholesome feel
about them.

Graveyard Path~
You are walking along the path next to the south gate of the graveyard. 
To the north, you see a massive tombstone through the mist and fog.  Even
from here, its magnitude and stability compel you towards it.  The path
continues to the west from here or east towards the gate.

Graveyard Path~
The path you are on continues to the north or to the east along the south
fence.  From here, you can see a large headstone to the west, but beyond
that, you cannot tell what could be out there.  Perhaps you should stay
on the path, just to be safe.  The fog thickens all around you, making it
somewhat difficult to take a deep breath of air.

Castle Graveyard~
A rather simple headstone sits here next to the path.  Although you
cannot see any distinguishing marks upon it, the headstone appears to
radiate an aura of evil and darkness.  In fact, something about this
headstone sends chills up and down your spine.  Looking around, you can
see other headstones to the north and west, but you have a strong urge to
get back on to the path to the east.

Although there is no obvious glow of magic around the headstone,

itself is unremarkable, nondesscipt even, for whatever may have been

Castle Graveyard~
You are now standing in the southwest corner of the graveyard.  A large
wrought iron fence extends to the north and east from this point.  A
rather large monument has been constructed here in the corner to honor
what appears to be a great hero who died in battle.  Aside from the
interesting depiction of some great war long ago, you can determine
nothing else from this tombstone.  Perhaps you should explore elsewhere
and allow this person to rest in peace.  The fog seems to becoming
lighter to the north.  To the east, you can see another headstone.

The monument is for a soldier who saved many of his comrades, although
his life was the cost.  Due to the passage of time, the soldier's name is
no longer known.  That part of the monument has been eroded.

E
depiction~
The picture on the monument, though faded and scarred in some places,
looks to be a battle scene.  It shows a lone man standing up to a force
of several orcs.

Castle Graveyard~
A large hole takes up this entire section of the graveyard.  Much to your
surprise, there is absolutely no fog or mist in this area.  A closer
inspection of the hole reveals that the it must have erupted from within,
as opposed to some external force.  Despite the hole and lack of fog,
everything to the north, east and south appears to be normal.  However,
"normal" is a relative term.  A wrought iron fence lies to the west.

Castle Graveyard~
Standing absolutely still, you can notice the sounds of ferocious beasts
through the slight fog which rolls in from the west.  Aside from a slight
discoloration of the ground below you, there are no indications that
anyone is buried here.  There are no monuments or shattered remains of
headstones, like you have found in other parts of this cemetery.  The
fence which lines the west end of the graveyard disappears to the north
and south.

The fog seems to be much lighter around this grave and further to the

The grave itself seems quite out of place, as it has not crumbled any. 
Also, the inscription on the marker is completely intact.  As many of the
other markers in this cemetery have eroded away, this one must be
different somehow.

The sight of this headstone brings a tear to your eye when you read the
inscription on the front.  A small flower rests at the base of the
headstone in front of you.  Suddenly, the sound of a ferocious howl
brings you out of your reverie.  Looking around, you can see that the fog
has become lighter to the north and west.  However, perhaps you should
climb back on to the path to the east.

large wrought iron fence extends to the north and west from this point. 
Unfortunately, the fog is so thick here, you cannot tell what is beyond
the fence.  However, you can see the small headstones which litter this
corner.  Apparently, someone has designated this corner as the cemetery
for their pets, which is evident by the engravings and gifts rotting in
front of a few of the tombstones.

gifts engravings~
The remains of several small gifts and engravings lie here.  It is hard
to tell what they were to begin with, but they appear to be either pet
toys of some kind, or simple plaques dedicated to the pets buried here.
~
E
fence~
The fence rises over your head, and the top almost disappears in the fog. 
The fence is slick to the touch, and climbing it would be impossible.
~
E
headstone headstones~
The headstones for the graves indicate that this part of the graveyard
was dedicated for the burial of pets.  The remains of wooden and cloth
gifts, as well as flowers lie on various graves, rotting slowly.

Castle Graveyard~
There are no headstones or markers of any kind here.  For some reason,
this part of the graveyard was never used.  The fog is quite thick here,
but you can just make out another fence to the south.  The fence next to
you seems to connect to the southern fence, but it is hard to tell for
sure.  To the north, you can see the branches on some trees.  There
appears to be something swinging from the branches.

You can just barely make out the south fence.  It seems to be very close,
although the mists distort the distance very much.
~
E
fence~
The fence is made of a very old metal.  However, age has not affected its
strength at all.  The top of the fence disappears in the mists.

The fog swirls around you, blocking the sight of anything more than a few
paces away.

The tree, although malformed with twisting branches, is much taller than
the fence next to it.  In the branches, swaying in the light breeze, are
what appears to be a few men.  However, the fog makes it hard to tell for
sure.

Castle Graveyard~
Roots from the stunted and malformed trees have begun to reach the fence
of the graveyard, although it will be many years before the fence itself
will be affected by them.  From the higher limbs of the trees hang a few
skeletons.  A small pile of bones lie at the roots.  Around you, the mist
clings heavily to the ground.

Bones from several human remains are gathered at the roots of the trees. 
Although the bones seem to have been gnawed on, no animals are in sight,
although you can see something gleaming from within the pile.
~
E
skeletons~
A few human skeletons hang from ropes in the higher branches of the trees. 
It seems that the bones are slowly falling down to lie among the roots.
~
E
roots~
The roots of the trees spread in all directions.  Some head towards the
graves, to feed on the remains of the dead, while others spread towards
the fence.
~
E
trees~
The trees seem to be very old, perhaps as old as the graveyard itself. 
However, such a life in these surroundings has twisted the trees into
grotesque mockeries.

Castle Graveyard~
A crumbling monument stands here.  Once, it may have been a statue of a
saint or holy figure, but now there is little of it left.  Time has worn
away its features, and rust has obscured the plaque at the base of the
monument.  A fence stands to the east, disappearing to the north and
south.  To the north, a path creeps along slowly through the graveyard. 
Beyond it, a dark image hides in the background.

castle, directly north of you.  Unfortunately, you can also see a huge
guardian that stands waiting for anyone to try to enter the path.

This is an out of the way part of the large hall which continues to the

and damp.  This area is not as well traveled like to the north.  The
torches and jewels still line the walls, but many of the torches along
the wall are no longer lit.  The wall to the west has a large crack in it.
~
Okay.  Now liches are cool and all, and fun to include in our areas, but
how does this guy fit here?  he doesn't even have a tomb, he's in the
hall, and liches generally have whole tombs and elaborate traps designed
to protect themselves (similar to dragons...) This guy kinda needs it. 
As for the mob itself, he's 30th leve, and dishes out a strange mpc. 
Furthermore, he's sentinel and his xp isn't protected at all.

You are standing in a large hall with lit torches mounted on the walls at
various intervals.  Around the torches, small jewels lie embedded in the
walls, creating a dazzling light show.  Peering into the distance to the
north, you can see a large room that is well lit.  The corridors extend
in each of the cardinal directions.  To the side of the hallway, a spiral
staircase rises into the ceiling.

which lies against the north wall.  Surprisingly, you see many footsteps

E
image prince~
The ethereal image of a proud man floats above the coffin.  You can
barely tell from the faint image that he appears to wear armor and a
scabbarded sword.  It seems to be the Prince's spirit.
~
E
writing~
The writing says, "A shield to shelter the weak, a sword to defend them
from evil, and a rose to remind us of the beauty and thorns of life." 
~
E
crest lid~
A closer look at the crest on the lid of the coffin shows that it is a
depiction of a knight's equipment.  It shows a shield, a sword, and a
rose.  The carvings are set deeply into the stone lid, and look as if
they would fit the actual items.  Below the crest is some @b@Cwriting@n.
~
E
coffin stone~
In the middle of the room rests a plain stone coffin.  It is unadorned
but for a single @C@bcrest@n carved into the lid.
~
E
carvings scenes walls ceiling floor~
In carvings on the walls and floor, you see the Prince in many battles. 
In some, he chases invading goblins away at the point of his army's
spears.  In another, he bows to the leader of the giants as they come to
a peace.  In all, he is shown to be a leader of men and the epitome of
honor.  The carvings cover the walls and ceiling and extend onto the
floor.  It appears the people that prepared this burial chamber honored
the Prince highly.

of angels and gods smiling down at the characters on the walls.  A much

Burned Room~
The walls are covered in what used to be shelves for books and scrolls
but they have all been burnt to nothing.  A pile of ashes in the center
of the room is what is left of the books and scrolls on the shelves.  The
smell of burnt wood is still in the air, suggesting that the fire occured
not too long ago.  A reading table sits in the northwest corner,
amazingly undamaged by whatever destroyed the rest of the room.  The only
exit is through the door to the east.
~
Considering that the items which this action loads STILL aren't finished,
and that t is lame for players to be able to merely search, quit, search,
quit to stockpile powerful items like scrolls of heal I have turned this
action off, once again.  Really good items need to be guarded by mobs,
especially when these items are high-level spells like confuse or heal in
an area without wandering aggressive mobs of real potential threat.

Tomb of the Castle~
This small corridor extends from the main corridor to the west.  The hall
appears to have been made rather hastily.  Jewels and torches line the
walls at varying intervals.  Above you, wooden beams support the rock
ceiling.  A wooden door with steel bands lies in the east wall.
~
I make the door reset locked and added the Imm Skeleton Key.  We need
more uses for thieves, and I doubt that a castle's back door, to a tomb
no less, would be left open.

cave continues to the west, and a fissure in the wall leads back out to
the hallway to the east.

This room is a large hall, continuing on to the north.  Long tables run
down the length of the room, with a smaller table sitting across the room
on this end.  The smaller table is probably the head table, where the

Between the long tables is a smaller table to place the meal while the
servants serve food from it.  This room is richly decorated with
paintings on the walls and a high ceiling gilded and painted.  A curtain
leading to a room to the east and the exit to the west are the only exits

here, and a small stage is set up for bands or plays.  Two statues of a
man and a woman fill the northwest and northeast corners.  Picked over
bones and scraps of metal and leather lie scattered about, looking to be
the remains of yet another victim of the monsters roaming the castle.

vines.  The vines swing hauntingly in the thick, gray mist.  Some of the
vines twist and tangle giving the appearance of nooses ready for a victim.

mists~
The mist seems to ebb and flow before your eyes, even though you do not
feel any breeze.  Looking through the mist you can barely make out the
silhouette of the tree trunk.

glimpse movement~
Out of the corner of your eye and saw movement in the mist below. 
Unfortunately it disappeared just a quick as it appeared seemingly
swollowed up in the swirling, gray mist.

Tree in the Graveyard~
The limb does not look as strong as it did near the trunk of the tree. 
The occasional crackling and shifting of the limb makes you think that it
is not use to supporting so much weight.  Twisting around the trunk and
hanging from the branches are a number of large green vines.  The mist
around the tree ebb and flow causing a feeling of vertigo.

Looking closer at the branches, you notice deep claw marks in the wood
where the bark is missing.

4 vines~
The vines twist and twine around the branches.  The thick, green stems
look as if they are crushing the life out of the branches they cling to. 
An occasional vine hangs down from the tree and the leafy end dangles in
the mist.
~
E
mist~
The mist is thick, even up in the tree.  A silhouette of the tree is all
you can see in the dismal, gray mist.  The mist seems to gently flow past
your eyes, sometimes thicker than other times.
~
E
6 branches~
The branches do not look the strongest and could not support your weight;
however, they do look like good support to keep from falling.  Some spots
along the branches seems to have been stripped of its bark.

Tree in the Graveyard~
The trunk of the tree has gotten considerably smaller and also much
weaker.  There are some branches extending out that help give you support.
The trunk is weathered and the bark crumbles in your hands.  There seems
to be some carvings etched into the wood.

6 branches~
The branches are much smaller than the lower branches.  They also look
much older and more weatherbeaten.  Towards the ends it almost looks as
if the wood is decaying.  Though the branches don't look very strong,
they do seem to give extra support which helps you keep your balance.
~
E
trunk 7 carvings~
The trunk of the tree is weathered and in areas large chunks of the bark
is missing.  In one of those gaps there are some carvings.  Looking
closer at the carvings most of the markings are gone, smoothed away by
weather and nature.
~
E
bark~
Examining the bark closer, you notice that not only is the bark old and
taken much abuse from the weather, but it is also grayish-black. 
The bark crumbles and disintigrates as you touch it.

Dark Shaft~
The shaft appears to be about 5 meters across, but there is only a single
ladder which allows a person to climb up and down.  Dark and dank, the
shaft continues into shear darkness in both directions.  You can just
make out the upper ledge of the shaft above you.

[Calliope] Would like to see the size of this room and the one below changed to no larger than horse size. Anything dinosaur size that climbed up it, couldn't get through the sarcophagus anyway.
