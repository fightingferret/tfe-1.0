Entryway to the Carnation Dump~
To the east stands a large iron gate.  It has obviously guarded this dump
for many years.  In all directions except east you you see many piles of
items.  Directly north a small heap of items that have just arrived and
are in no way sorted, lie scattered on the ground.  West you see a path
that winds it way through the piles and off in the distance to a small
shack.
~
[Kiian] if it is obvious you don't need to say so
[Kiian] might want to adjust name of dump to fit more along lines of medienne/human society

east gate iron large~
A large iron gate closes off the dump from the rest of the world.  As you
take a closer look, the bars and spikes that top the structure appear to
be made of old forks and spoons.  The rusty hinges moan as a gust of wind
leans on the face of the gate.  The latch of the gate looks new.  It
still has a new grime free surface, and looks reliable, more than the
gate itself.

Between the Piles of Garbage~
Piles of moldy papers and worn shoes lie haphazardly all around you
making it difficult to pick your way past.  There is an unusually large
pile of dead horses and unidentifiable animal carcasses blocking your
path north.  As you saunter past the foul pile, something catches your
eye as it scampers under a partially decomposed severed head.

An expression of terror still lingers in the face of this poor animal. 
With care . you. nudge it with . you.r foot, having disturbed the heads resting
place a few cockaroaches crawl out of its gaping mouth towards you.

E
stack horses carcasses~
From the look of this heap, you estimate there to be at least
twenty-three corpses in the pile.  Horses of every breed appear to be
represented in one rotting maggot infested way or another.  Moldering
corpses of forgotton pets are mixed into the pile as well.  A brown and
black hunting dog, a large cat and a partially eaten green pseudo-dragon
lie near the edges of the heap.

Among The Heaps~
The small path between the towering putrid piles seems tighter here as
the piles lean haphazardly towards you.  Continuing your trek in any
direction will be difficult, not to mention smelly because piles of
rotting trash surround you in every direction.  The southern exit is
completely cut off by a rustling mound of dry leaves and branches.

Near the Turnaround~
Slightly away from the initial dumping sites, where the freshest piles of
rubbish lay, you stand in an open space.  The ground is striated with
wheel marks from the varied carts used to transport the garbage to its
final resting place.  Looking off to the south you can see only splinters
of sky past the towering heaps of refuse.

Dead End~
Somewhere behind the multiple piles of trash, you can see a vine-covered
brick wall.  A pile of leaves to your right rustles and appears to be
moving.  Peeking around it you spy a small white mouse scurrying into a
hole in the wall's mortar.

Shivering and shaking, this pile appears to be alive.  But with closer

A Smelly Pile of Rubbish~
The growing stench of rotting debris fills your nostrils, causing you to
gag and choke.  The curving path winds itself to the north and east,  
there is also a clearing visible to the south.
~
[Merior] will the stench grow no matter what direction you have come from?
[S'ynn] yes... this area is particularly stinky.

As your nose slowly becomes accustomed to the stench, you begin to see
that the piles of broken bottles and soiled rags is really quite charming. 
Oddly enough it seems that someone has been trying to salvage and recycle
some of the articles.  A slightly worn tapestry is draped over a nearby
heap, giving the dump a little warmth and personality.

Piles of Glass~
This dead end looks more like a room with walls made of discarded jars,
broken goblets and bits of shattered window.  It appears that the glass
was at one time seperated by color, but it has now merged to form a
rainbow of sorts.  Dust and scratches have dulled many of the pieces but
the piles are still a pleasant change from the omnipresent filth and mold
in the rest of the area.

Amidst the junk and moldering bits of food, you stumble upon a great
collection of valubles.  In every corner of this area is filled with
silverware, every style and every pattern seems to be represented.  A few
even appear to be of the last century.  Long scrape marks trail from
behind one box that is sitting in front of you.  A large sign on a wooden

Trash is piled everywhere, most of it extremely fresh and squishy. 
Leaning against one of the more moderately sized piles is a torn painting
of a fair but rather portly woman.  Next to it lie a few broken chairs
with worn cushions and broken arms.  A burlap sack sits on one of them as
if it were a living being.

burlap sack~
This sack is made of a coarse brown burlap.  Its seams are strained and
items are poking through the cracks.  A foul smelling substance is

E
torn painting woman~
There is a large rip that starts at the womans left eye and continue down
to about the middle of her right leg.  Ignoring the tear, the woman
portrayed here appears to be in her mid thirties.  The painting as a
whole is not displeasing, but you cannot see it ever hanging in a gallery
of fine art.
~

broken worn chairs cushions~
A stack of broken chairs towers here with their wooden arms hanging limp
and splintered on either side of their seats.  Stuffing is popping out
from between the seams of the cushion's worn cover.  Every piece of
furniture here is in a terrible state of disrepair.  There is little hope
of resurrecting any of the pieces, even if brought to the best furniture
repair shop.

The path you are following forks into two unequal parts here.  To the

untouched.  You can hear the distant shriek of a rat who got too close to
a creeping vine, or could it be something much worse down this southern

Humongus Pile of Trash~
You have reached the far northeast corner of the Terr'kaa dump.  From the
looks of the tracks in the dirt, a few carts still seems to come here on
a regular basis.  A rather large heap of horse dung sits here, drying in
the sun.  Consisting of mostly digested hay and grass, this dung gives
off a rather aromatic perfume.

Heap of Rusted Metal~
Further to the west, you can see an old ramshackle structure.  Your
progress in that direction is hindered by a large heap of rusted weaponry. 
Broken swords, dull daggers and bent maces jut out at you from every
possible direction.  Attempting to climb this massive pile of metal would
be futile, not to mention that the chance of contracting gangrene is
incredibly high.  You have no choice to turn back to the way you 
came.

Sharp metal points from swords jut out at you from every possible angle. 
Looking at the pile, you think you see a way of climbling the wobbly
monstrosity without severe injury.  A few maces lie parallel to one
another making a rickety step, a pace away from it is another step
consisting of two rusty swords.  With luck, climbing this heap should be
no problem what so ever, or so you think.

Looming around you are multiple hulking piles of old chicken bones and

Pieces of broken bowls and plates are scattered everywhere.  A few of

huge cross axes north~
Made of clear ice, these two impressive axes stand about one and a half

All of the trees in this area appear to be made of crystaline ice.  Soft
tinkling can be heard as a crisp breeze passes through their branches and
leaves.  A small path winds its way through the dense growth to the east,
west, and north.  Two large boulders sit on either side of the path to the
south as if guarding it.
~
[S'ynn] when entering from south, hear a crackle of the guards turning
back to ice and axes shutting off the exit.

As you stare up at the ice trees, you notice a deep axe cut in one of
them.  No mortal could have made such an impressive chop in the hard
surface of the bark.  Especially because the bottom of the chop is almost
15 feet from the ground and there are no branches one could use as foot
holds up to that point.  The trail splits in all of the cardinal
directions from here.

making probress to the east impossible.

The Shimmering Forest~
It appears that a large animal was fighting here.  A half dozen crystal
trees lie shattered on the slick ice-covered ground.  Avoiding the large
cliff to the north, the melee continues around the sheer drop to the
east.

The Shimmering Forest~
It appears that a large animal had begun a battle of sorts here.  A few
of the branches that over hung the path have been carelessly ripped off
and have fallen shattered to the ground.  To the south there has been a
clearing made in the trees.  While the path continues to the north and
east.

A Sheer Cliff~
Leaning over the edge of the cliff, bracing yourself against the cold
rough surface of a near by tree, you squint into the blanket of fog that
obscures the bottom of the canyon.  Due to the thick grey mist that
swirls 15 feet below it makes guaging the drop impossible

This thick grey fog blankets the canyon in a visually non-penetratable

Looking up there appears to be few hand holds to assist your climb back
up to the cliff edge.  The only exit is to the east into a smally b gully.

A Clearing in the Trees~
A small clearing has been made here off of the beaten trail.  About 3
crystaline tree stumps sit decappitated in the center of the clearing. 
planted carefully betwene the stumps is a small table sutable for placing
one's coffe or pastery down on for a nice tea time break.

crystaline trees stumps decappitated~
Something has sawn off the se trees at the base.  Leaving n about 1.5
feet of trunk pertruding from the ground.  In the middle of the stump
circle is a carefully crafted table made of brances and leaves of the
surrounding trees.

E
carefully crafted table~
About 10 branches have been bound together in the middle and them evenly
positioned into an asteriks formation.  Small flat crystaline leaves have
been layd over the top of it for a smooth surface.  The feet f this table
have been expertly carfved.  Each of which look resective le like a bear,
a deer and an opossum standing on their hind legs balancing the tabletop
on their heads.

To the south, the ice covered path takes a sharp turn right and from
there dissapears into the distance.  The trees grow densly along the edge
of the path, as if afraid of intruding into its borders.

A small amount of water has gathered in the ditch making the ground moist

Eventhough seemingly impossible, the trees have grown up from the ground
at a ridged 90 degree angle to the ground and impacted themselves up
agains one another forming a formidable wall on either sid of the path. 
To the north, the trees appear to be a tad more relaxed and spaced out,
while to the south the monotony of squished trees continues around the
bend.
