Tower Foyer -- Entrance~
You are at the entrance to an aged tower.  A plush carpet has been spread
all along the room, covering much of the wooden floor.  Dangling from the
dusty ceiling is a surprisingly fine crystalline chandelier.  An eerie
silence pervades the foyer.  The only interruption to the silence is an
occasional creaking noise, perhaps of the tower settling...  or something
else.  A large heavy oak door lies to the south, allowing departure from
the tower.
~
[Merior] is chandelier crystal or crystalline?
[Starshine] extra south: keyhole?
[Starshine] make creak a random acode, rather than in room desc?  add
action listen, perhaps?
[Starshine] extra wooden floor: would be nice for flavor to get a
description of the wood and floor...

The chandelier dangles precariously from the cracked wooden ceiling.  It

Tower Foyer -- Stairwell~
The northern wall is painted in the distinctive @Yyellow@n and @Rred@n
that give the entire foyer a somewhat cheerful look.  It is in sharp
contrast to the decrepit look evinced by the worn carpet and chipped wood
from the wall and floor.  Protruding its way out from the wall is a small
crank with a furred handle.  A narrow wooden stairwell stands alone at
the middle of the room.  Twisting and turning, it leads upstairs into
unknown darkness.
~

[Starshine] room desc: change to "painted a distinctive..." or perhaps the yellow/red color should be pointed out in other foyer rooms, if it's also on other walls? seems like it'd be rather noticeable.
[Starshine] extra north: remove keyword north. paint isn't dull?
[Starshine] extra carpet: add keywords floor/wood?
[Starshine] use color on stairwell in roomdesc?

The faded scarlet carpet contains patches of dust.  Moth-eaten holes

A Hidden Chamber~
You are in a narrow, unlit hallway.  Although cobwebs now hang from the
ceilings and walls, this small chamber appears as though it was once
often used.  The wooden floors show a lot of wear, as if many feet have
trod upon it.  Greasy stains and spills have marred the floor and the
southern wall.  At the lower right-hand side of the southern wall is a
small crank with a furred, black handle.  Gazing northward, you can make
out what appears to be a kitchen; while to the east and west are a few
rooms with a lot of old tools.
~

[Starshine] perhaps change right-hand side? not sure having the rdesc depend on a direction of viewing is good.

Tower Foyer~
Like the rest of the foyer, this section shows many signs of wear and
abuse.  The carpet has many large holes, and the walls have several
cracks in the shapes of a lightning bolt.  Cluttered into one huge pile,
old wooden and stuffed dolls rest neglected at the northeast corner of
the foyer.  In the middle of the partially carpeted floor is a cracked
wooden door.  Disrupting the strange @Yyellow@n and @Rred@n design of the
eastern wall is a small wooden door.

The walls are painted in a @Yyellowish@n color with large @Rred@n circles

huge pile dolls corner~
A thin layer of dust has accumulated upon this pile of toys.  Small
wooden figurines of various animals, fairies, and gnomes as well as
stuffed, plush dolls of animals lie on top of each other.  Some are
missing arms, legs, or tails, while others appear in decent condition,
merely untouched for a long while.

Tower Foyer~
Thin layers of dust blanket the carpeted floor.  The smell of stale air
permeates throughout much of this part of the foyer.  The once bright
colors of the northern and western walls appear more faded, the paint
having been worn out.  A cracked wooden door on an uncarpeted section of
the floor lies at the center, while a small marble door stands against
the western wall.

Tower Basement~
Many tiny dust particles scatter into the air, making it difficult to
look around clearly.  Some of them cling to your face and onto your
clothes.  Off to the north is a silver, knobless door.  Numerous symbols
line up and down its smooth-looking surface.  In the middle of this room
is a narrow wooden staircase which leads upstairs.  The basement appears

A Storage Room~
A strange, tremendous warmth seems to be originating from something along
the corners of the room.  Rolling down the dark stone walls are thick,
brownish stains.  Perhaps the stains were caused by the heat mixing with
chemicals in the walls, or perhaps they were caused by something else... 
Scattered into tall, island-like stacks all across the floor are
dust-covered toys and dolls.  A faint light seems to be emanating from
one of the stacks.

A Kitchen~
Small and unorganized, this kitchen appears to be a makeshift room used
to prepare and serve food as quickly as possible.  Dusty cupboards hang
just high enough for a gnome-sized person to reach.  A blackened stove
has been placed at the northern end, with a few half-burnt logs still in
it.  To the north is an almost-clear glass door leading outside to a deck. 
To the east is a small door with a window at the top of it leading to
what looks like a pantry; while to the west is an eating area.  To the
south is an unlit hallway.
~
logs and flint used to summon a flame demon each reset, will add hint
somewhere in descrip later possibly 
flame demon resets a charcoal for claw custom
[Starshine] room desc: make last sentence "South is an unlit hallway."?
[Starshine] extra dusty: change "deteriorated"? not really an adjective.
[Starshine] would be nice to have east/west/south/north extras, since you should be able to look in a direction...
[Starshine] add to acode 1: burn command?
[Starshine] you want a mob to load if enough logs and have flint. right now - if the area has just reset and a demon is already here (someone fled from it) and i type light stove, it says i need logs, if i then put on logs, i can pop another demon. is this meant?
[Starshine] acode 2: perhaps should be: if demon in room, you can't get close enough to the stove, else if reset0, put log in stove, remove reset0.
[Starshine] then acode 1: if demon in room, you can't get close enough to the stove to light it. else if reset0, need more logs, else check flint, load demon.
[Starshine] might want to make use of reset1 (remove reset1 when demon loaded) so you can only load 1 demon a reset. right now, i can keep killing demons as long as i have flint.
[Starshine] hmm...OR could set flag reset0 when demon loaded, so player has to put in another log, which player probably doesn't have a lot of.
[Starshine] add hint - the stove still looks usable, but would need a fresh log before it could be lit...?

Tower Foyer~
This section of the foyer is even more dilapidated than the rest. 
Splattered haphazardly along the worn carpet are dried bloodstains from a
not so recent struggle.  A gnome-sized dent has been deeply ingrained
into the brightly painted western wall.  Hanging along the southern wall
is a framed drawing of a small gnomish child.
~

added it altho it didn't seem to make much sense for one since the rdesc
is basically of the foyer, hence rname 
[Merior] i agree - dont need foyer extra
[Merior] might want carpet not scarlet to better show the blood?
[Merior] not sure i understand ion shield on the mob or detect hidden
[Merior] marmor is kinda low - up by like 4 to 6 each
[Starshine] replace "ingrained" it's functioning as a verb and has a different meaning in that capacity.
[Starshine] extra worn: bloodstains
[Starshine] extra western: use 1 western would include 1 west in keywords here.
[Starshine] extra southern: perhaps add 1 before southern keyword here? also "...a stuffed"
[Starshine] why is mob's mflag left hand checked when nothing sets on it?

The walls of these rooms are painted in a bright @Yyellow@n and mixed
with splotches of deep @Rred@n circles.  The strange designs of the walls
contrast with the decaying look of the room.  Cobwebs inhabit the
southeast corner of the room, like a thick veil covering the floor's
edges.  Almost half an inch of dust has accumulated upon the worn carpet.

Tower Deck~
This spacious wooden deck overlooks the expansive forest north of you. 
Gazing northward beyond the railing of the deck, you marvel at the dark
green, leafy tops of many trees.  Appearing faded and gray, the wooden
finish of the deck's railing and floor has eroded, making it slightly
dangerous for anyone to tread upon without fear of a loose board suddenly
breaking.  You can move westward along the deck, or head through the
glass door and back south into the tower.

Hallway -- Second Floor~
This narrow, unlit hallway extends north and south along wooden
floorboards which have become creaky and worn.  Somber blue and red paint
along the walls has chipped away, revealing the dark gray stone of the
walls.  Hanging crookedly from them are a few oil paintings.  A twisting
staircase in the middle of the hallway leads downstairs to the main floor.

This section of the basement is even more dank and dustier than the rest. 
Brownish and greenish fungi have sprouted across the ground and even
along the gray walls.  Moving around the soft, sloppy floor may prove
rather arduous and unpleasant.  The muddy ground also gives off a musky,

This room looks as though a wild hurricane blew through it.  The wood
from the ceiling is cracked, and the beams supporting it appear ready to
collapse at any moment.  Forming thick, unkempt piles at the corners of

within the piles are rusty hammers, chisels, nails, carving knives, and
other tools.  You can leave west.

Dry paint, along with the muddy soil and surprising dampness of this

the floor and atop some crates and storage boxes are piles of dolls,
gadgets, and other toys.  A film of dust covers the toys as well as

towering marble obelisk symbols~
The black marble obelisk stretches ten feet in the air, almost piercing
through the ceiling.  Strange inscriptions surround its surface.  Several
lines seems to section off the obelisk, possibly as a representation of
different planes of existence or worlds.  On the bottom are
ferocious-looking beasts lifting up their hands or other limbs trying to
touch the things above.  The middle depicts familiar things such as trees
and humanoids.  The top of the obelisk is the most difficult to decipher. 
A small smudge of something green partially covers it.  If you reach high
enough, you think you could wipe it off.

A Nursery Room~
The light blue paint and wondrous drawings along the walls remind you
that this now dilipidated place may have once been cherished by its
former inhabitants.  The painting of a bright yellow sun with a broad,
smiling face gazes cheerfully at you from the ceiling.  On the carpeted
floor, worn dolls and toy balls lie scattered about.  Resting against the
eastern wall is a small crib in the shape of a ship.

A Game Room~
Deep yellow wood, mixed with smooth white stone, create a rather pleasant
yet banal design for the walls of this room.  A few dartboards hang along
the western wall.  Prominently placed as the heart of the room is a chess
table made of solid granite.  At one corner is a pile of wooden boards
with various patterns on them.  Some show diamond-shaped, black and red
designs while others have squares drawn around their edges.

[Starshine] room desc: This part of the deck...?
[Starshine] extra north/west - forest, south - window, wall of tower, east - deck and door?
[Starshine] change acode 1 to both get and search? since searching clay pots where you end up finding a pot seems a bit strange.
[Starshine] acode 2/3 - randomize? or use stat check?
[Starshine] perhaps load flint as part of search pots action? rather than just leaving it lying about?

A Balcony~
You are on a rundown balcony overlooking the entrance to the tower. 
Narrow cracks have formed on the floor's tiles, and some of them have
become dislodged from the balcony.  The railing is made of a grayish
stone and forms a continuous semi-circle.  Gazing southward, you are
treated to a magnificent view of towering beech and oak trees of the
dense forest.

A Master Bedroom~
A powerful force seems to have decimated this once splendid room.  The
carpet has been ripped apart, with many holes and reddish stains scattered
all across it.  A full-sized bed draped in torn, stained fabric rests
against the eastern wall.  Next to the bed is a wide office desk with a
very cluttered top.  A large, oval-shaped window lies on the southern
wall, its glass partially broken.  A lever hangs just beside the window.

A Round, Smoky Chamber~
Many pieces of junk litter the tiled floor of this round, spacious room. 
Grabbing your attention is a pile of smelly remains of some poor soul who
wandered here.  The bones appear snapped in half, and insects now reside
within a cracked skull.  Oddly enough, the smoke, which permeates through
the chamber, seems to avoid the pile of bones, forming a round, smokeless
gap above it.  At the southern end of the room stands a wide, carpeted
stairwell.

Hallway -- Third Floor~
The halls here are decked in gaudy trinkets, such as small copper
pentagrams and miniature skulls of various animals.  On the floor are the
decomposing remains of previous visitors.  They lie spread across the
eastern wall, a testament or possible warning of the dangers of your
current location.  The hallway comes to an abrupt end southward as a
metallic stairwell stands, providing passage upstairs.

This stairwell is surprisingly ostentatious, unlike much of the rest of
this otherwise ordinary-looking tower.  The polished banister of the
stairwell is made of thick oak wood, and its smooth texture demonstrates

A Lavish Throne Room~
Blue and silver glitter from the domed ceiling of this extravagantly
furnished, yet extremely warm chamber.  Piles of coins resembling ocean
waves surround the room, sparkling so brightly that they might blind
someone who stared at them for too long.  Menacingly situated at the
center is a huge throne of bones.  From behind the throne stream out
thick white vapors.  Just below and before the throne upon the marble-
tiled floor is an immense, neatly-drawn pentagram.

Before an Old Tower~
You stand before an enormous stone tower.  The blue paint on its facade
is cracked and peeling, leaving behind a decrepit, abandoned appearance
to the tower.  A large heavy oak door to the north serves as the only
obvious entrance.  Long strands of ivy grow beside the door and covers
much of the tower's front.  Dense, overgrown shrubs and trees obstruct
travel west and south.  To the east, a plant-covered trail slopes its way
downward.

Chirping noises from the dense forest to the north and south are the only

tall trees to the northwest, you can make out an aged tower whose stone
appears worn and eroded.  You can move up the trail eastward, or down the
trail westward.

An Overgrown Path -- Before a Gazebo~
To the north of you stands a gazebo which obviously has not been cared
for lately.  Its wood is cracked and faded gray, and many rocks and twigs
cover the steps of the entrance.  Trees surround its wooden railing, like
giant, intimidating guardians.  The trail slopes slightly down if you
head east, and upward if you head west.
