Hidden Trail~
The path takes a sharp turn here, bending around to the east and south. 
The drab grey of the surrounding area mirrors the dull gravel of the
path, creating a lackluster, dismal landscape.  Looking northward, you
see only a barren field of grey stone.  To the south, trees loom at ever
closer intervals, split by a small path which winds its way deep into the
stone forest.

A Winding Trail~
The somber, grey trail runs through the colorless area surrounding it. 
The vegetation which borders the trail has sickened and died, leaving
only brown leaves and blackened stems behind.  Standing at irregular
intervals, a few tall, slender trees dot the area to the south of the
path.  The trees are a drab, grey color, right down to the leaves.

Closer examination of the slender trees reveals that they have been
turned to stone.  The delicate stone leaves have broken off in places,
leaving razor-sharp shards of broken stone behind.  Littering the ground
near the trunks of the trees is a myriad of broken stone in the shapes of
twigs, leaves, and even the occasional branch.

A Hidden Trail - Near a Stone Sapling~
In the middle of the trail upon which you stand, a small stone tree
stands.  The sapling's trunk is only as thick as a man's forearm,
indicating its scant age.  Grey vines of ivy wind their way around the
oak sapling, giving the semblance of leaf-bearing limbs.  The rocky
ground around the tree supports only dead and dying vegetation.  A few
scraggly young trees try to grow in the poor soil around the trail,
though their leaves are scant and brown.

This tall, thin sapling was once a thriving, vibrant young oak.  Its

On Path to Woods~
Dying, scraggly trees hang their bare limbs down over the path, as if
reaching for what little life is still left near the forest floor.  The
few green plants left among the brownish dead brush struggle to reach the
sun.  Greying ivy strangles the last bits of life out of the dwarfed
trees, even as the vines themselves perish.

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
A gentle breeze blows through the silent forest, passing over you in a
gentle caress.  The stone leaves of the tall oak trees stir not at all,
immobilized forever.  Petrified bushes border the trail through the
forest, pruned and trimmed into patterns nature never intended.  A few
stone birds perch on the limbs of the petrified oaks, frozen for all time.

Bushes of solid rock line the trail along this portion of it, while
beyond the bushes stand a wealth of tall, slender oaks.  Well trimmed and
pruned, the bushes were in full bloom when their metamorphosis was
effected.  Delicate stone flowers peek out from between the flinty leaves
of the shrubbery.  A small fox, caught in the act of slinking through the
flowery flora, was petrified along with the vegetation.  His fluffy tail
and beady eyes are clearly visible between the stalks of the bushes.

Hidden Trail~
The silent, somber trail is bordered here by drab, ashen vegetation.  The
plants cling to their precarious existence, the hard, rocky ground
allowing no room for water to flow to their roots.  Dwarfed, twisted
trees grow in small patches to the south, their leaves long since fallen. 
Rocks color are scattered liberally throughout the area, cluttering the
trail.  The absence of vivid color is profound; the faint green of the
dying plants the only hue other than the dismal grey.

The drab landscape around you is limned in shades of grey.  The light grey
of the dry, ash-like dirt which covers the ground on and around the trail
blends with gravel of a darker grey.  The few struggling plants which grow
in the harsh, rocky soil are limp and wilting, all the green draining out
of them to be slowly replaced by a greyish-brown color.

Hidden Trail~
An opaque, swirling mist creeps along the ground.  A faint breeze blows in
from the north, tattering the veil of mist aside in places to reveal
rocky, uneven ground.  Patches of gravel and grey, lifeless dirt are
visible for a moment before the mist closes back in.  The smell of death
and decay wafts past your nostrils, carried in from the north by the light
breeze.

The trail winds its way through the crowded stone trees of the petrified

hang their flinty limbs over the small trail.  Looking up into the boughs
of the trees, you see a stone robin seated among the stone leaves, his
once red breast turned a somber grey.

A Narrow Path Through the Stone Forest~
Tall, slender pillars of stone jut out of the grey earth, the remnant of
these once magnificent young oaks.  Branching out from the stone trunks
are thin, fragile limbs covered with delicate stone leaves.  A few of the
flinty leaves have fallen to the ground to shatter into a myriad of
jagged shards.  The path which runs north and south through the desolate
forest has fallen into disrepair and you must pick your way carefully
through the broken fragments of stone.

densely, their trunks thicker than those to the north.

A Narrow Path through the Stone Forest - Path's End~
The trees crowd in closely around you, the path all but obscured by the
moderately slender oaks.  Stone bushes and shrubs border the path, ending
abruptly with a wide trellis on each side.  The stone vines which cling to
the trellises bear large, delicately shaped flowers.  To the south, the
narrow path fades away, absorbed by the dense stands of trees.

The forest stands silent and desolate in its monotonous greyness.  The
tree trunks are close together, their stony boughs hopelessly intertwined
into a flinty canopy overhead.  Precious little light could filter through
the tangled mass above.  The ground is littered with broken shards of
stone leaves that have fallen in a rather sad parody of autumn.  It is
possible to make your way through the trees on three sides, but to the
east the trees form an impenetrable barrier of stone trunks.

A thin trickle of water runs through the center of this area of the

tiny brook burbles along cheerfully.  A few drooping plants have taken
root near the stream, trying desperately to leech life out of the sterile
layer of dust.  The stone trees stand in a forbidding wall to the south,

Stone Forest - A Silent Corner of the Woods~
This corner of the forest is silent and grim.  The lovely stone trees
stand as silent sentinels, watching over the forest eternally.  A few
blades of grass struggle to grow in the lifeless grey soil, which is
little more than the dust of ground stone.  Stone limbs lie scattered
around on the forest floor, shattered by the drop to the hard ground.

The Stone Forest - Twin Oaks~
Twinned oak trees stand silently in the desolate remains of the forest. 
The texture of the two trunks reveal that they had grown together from
time long past, and had not merely toppled against each other after being
unable to support their new weight.  The elegant arching of the two trees
creates a long patch of twilight grey against the slate-colored ground of
the forest.

A light, powdery film of grey dust blankets the area, presumably all that
remains of trees vaporized in the explosion which laid waste to this area. 
Still other stone trees were shattered like glass, the jagged remnants of
the riven trees litter the area.  Charred trunks of stone trees dot the
area, looking like rows of sharpened stakes.  A tiny stone mouse stands
caught in the poise of running, its little tail close to the ground.

tall, majestic, stone oak.

limbs, and create angular shadows across the ashen plain.

surrounded by the limbs and leaves of other trees that were torn away as

E
oak tree behemoth~
This massive old oak appears to have been felled just as the
petrification swept over this part of the forest.  The freshly cut tree
transformed to stone, as well, though parts of it seem to have rotted
away as dead wood.

Stone Forest - Near an Old Campsite~
A gentle breeze flows through the area from the west, carrying with it
the gentle sound of running water.  The stone flora is thick, the stone
leaves of many plants tangle together creating a barrier to the west.  A
ring of small rocks has been piled together to create a makeshift hearth
for a fire.  Two sticks of old, rotting wood jut up from the ground,
supporting a metal spit from which hangs the skeleton of small animal,
possibly a rabbit.

Stone Forest~
A canopy of tangled stone branches shelters the area from the sky.  A
myriad of stone leaves in various states of condition lie scattered all
along the forest floor.  Moss and ivy that clings to the stone trees has
turned to flinty grey stone.  Lustrous grey stone trees surround you on
all sides, though to the north, west, and south you could probably
squeeze through the oak trunks.  To the east, an impregnable barrier of
intertwined trees prevents passage.

Stone Forest - Before a Shattered Gap in the Trees~
The trees come to an abrupt end here, closing in so thickly that nothing
could slip through the impenetrable stone wall of oaks.  However, blown
right through the middle of the seemingly impervious bastion is a gaping
hole.  About ten feet in diameter, the hole is almost perfectly circular. 
The bottoms of the devastated trees are still intact, mostly and the
intertwined tangle of stone boughs holds the tops in their original
places, defying gravity.
~
this is where the water serpent busteed through the trees to get to his
little pond.

Stone Forest - Near a Stone Druid~
A tall, majestically beautiful stone oak stands here, proudly hanging its
grey boughs out over the area.  Strangely enough, the oak stands in
seeming dominance over the other trees.  Its boughs spreading freely, the
other trees perhaps not quite daring to intertwine their limbs with that
of the singularly lovely oak.  At the base of the petrified oak a man
kneels, though he, too, is as petrified as every other creature in this
sad forest.  One stone hand is placed on the tree trunk, the other raised
to the heavens clasping a strange symbol.  Passage to the east is blocked
by a barrier of close oaks.
~
Acode pending a cflag for Cynnis' religion, then will load the symbol for
followers.

man druid base~
The stone man kneels at the base of the lovely oak, his head bowed and
his posture that of a suppliant.  One hand rests lovingly on the stone
bark of the oak before him, and the other is raised high.  He clasps a
strange symbol in his upraised hand.
~
E
symbol~
The symbol depicts a wolf under a blanket of snow-covered trees, howling
at a quarter moon with a naked female llewyrr stretching to complete its
diameter.  The symbol is made of an untarnished silvery metal, possibly
mithril or silver alloy.

Stone Forest - Near a Crimson Blossom~
Overshadowed by a forbidding wall of densely packed trees to the east, the
forest is grim and grey.  Stone ivy vines rest lightly on the petrified
trunks of adult oak trees.  A few petrified plants resting around the
bases of the oak trees bear delicate stone blossoms, brittle to the touch.
One flowering plant retains a single red flower, a splash of crimson
which breaks the desolate monotony of the grey landscape.

This small, crimson flower looks to be some variety of wild rose.  The

A Shattered Path Through the Crowded Trees~
The trees here have been shattered to create this tunnel-like path through the
closely crowded copse.  The stone trees have been melted away in places,
though mostly it looks like something crashed through by sheer force
alone.  There are a few tooth marks and slashes on the still standing
remains of several shattered stone oaks.

Smashed aside by the might of some obviously powerful force,
stone trees lay in a myriad of shards and chunks all over the ground.  The
marks of giant teeth marr the surrounding trees.  The remaining oaks close
in around their fallen comrades, making the path constrictingly close.

A Shattered Path Through the Crowded Trees~
The narrow confines of this enclosed path seem to bear down on you.  The
air is heavy and still, tinged slightly with a faint odor of decay.
Shards of stone that have been melted together lie in heaps along the
ground.  Splintered tree trunks combine with the residual stone to make
progress through the area slow and painful.  Ominous creaks and cracks
filter down from above, where the stone boughs of the still-standing oaks
support a canopy of torn tree tops.  To the east, the stench of decay
grows stronger, accompanied by the moist scent of water.

A Brackish Pond~
This old pool is covered with moss and a greyish-green slime.  The
brackish water beneath the viscous covering roils uneasily.  A few
forlorn plants have taken root in the slimy foam around the edge of the
pool, their stunted leaves and brown stems showing the sickly influence
of the unhealthy liquid in the pond.
