Small Forest Path~
The forest is extremely dense here with the small forest path coming to
an abrupt end.  Small bushes can be seen growing between the tall pine
trees to the east and west.  A small gap in the trees to the north allows
passageway to what looks like the remains of a garden.

Unkept Garden~
Tall, untidy grass grows all around, it appears that it has remained
uncut for many years.  Thin strips of pine peek out from among the weeds,
marking where a flowerbed once stood, but now separate a small compost
heap from the neighbouring vegetation.  To your north stands a small
house; it too shows signs of long-standing neglect.

Decrepit House~
A decrepit house looms ahead of you, its form casting a huge shadow over
the surrounding area.  The paint on this old building has all but
disappeared, with the rotten timber showing through quite clearly.  The
beams of the building creak from each gust of wind which blows through
the house.  There is a door to the north to enter into the house.

Hall~
The walls are barely covered by a flaky white paint which makes the damp
walls clearly visible.  There is a coarse, faded rug that lies in the
centre of the hall, its colour long since lost to time.  The surrounding
floorboards are rotten and uneven; it appears that they could collapse at
any time.  There is a set of stairs in the corner of the room leading to
the next floor.

The floorboards are made from solid oak.  The wood has been eaten away

The stairs look to have been very badly built using a dark hardwood. 
Most of the steps have broken with constant use and their old age.  The
steps that still remain are almost totally rotten and uneven with just a

The heavy smell of a coal fire lingers in the air.  At the far end of the

have been stained black from smoke, indicating the flue may not have
worked properly.  At the side of the room there is a small glass window
looking out into the garden.

The shelves of the larder are bare, the food having long since been

in the wall, trickling into the centre of the room to form a large puddle. 
There is an echo of water draining through the rickety floor boards.

The smell of cold rock and mud drifts in the air, squalid and old.  The

drips from the ceiling creating a steady fall of water like a fine spring
rain.  To the north the stream appears to become deeper.

from the high cavern ceiling, and a pale milky liquid drips from them. 
Large rocks covered in algae are strewn about the area like stepping

Base of a Well~
The rock walls glisten, reflecting the already reflected light from a
large pool of water.  The pool is immense, and is filled with what
appears to be a never-ending supply of fresh water.  There is a small
crack in the rocks where the water gushes into a stream that has
developed to the south.  A red brick well has been built above you.  The
bricks have started to crumble with old age and with frequent use.  At
the side of the cave there is an iron lever.

Garden Well~
No grass grows here, just large weeds that can survive in these unkept
conditions.  A red brick well has a rope hanging down its centre which
sways with the wind.  Moss covers the exterior of the well and weeds
decorate its base.  There is a winch attached to the centre of the well.

Inside a Fireplace~
The fireplace is almost pitch black, with the brick walls having 
been scorched from the heat of the fire.  On the floor remains the 
ash of burnt timber.  The smell of a burning wood fire still lingers 
in the air.  Above you the flue is covered in thick dark soot.

Garden Path~
This seems to be the start of a small garden.  It has run wild, plants
are twice as big as they should be.  To the south runs a small path, by
the side lies an old terracotta pot.  Broken pottery lays scattered
about the area, suggesting that once there were many potted plants here.

The small path snakes its way, cutting through the darkened ground.  A
lonely sundial stands tall and proud trying to not get strangled and
buried by the rampaging plants.  As you overlook the garden you spy a
small fountain tucked away, covered with sweet smelling honeysuckle.  To
the west a row of small bushes grow, to the east large trees shadow the
area.

Masses of wild flowers grow everywhere, they tumble onto the path.  It
looks like it once was a beautiful mosaic full of colour and vigour, now
only small sections of it remain - the rest broken and lost to time.  A
small statue is covered by tall shrubs with deep vermilion buds which
sway in the sweet smelling air.  Under an archway lies an ivy covered
bench, the archway was once strong and proud, but now weeps due to the
harshness of nature.

The wooden walls of the house have been severely damaged by the

there seems to be the rotten remains of bear meat.  There appears to 
have been a door to the west which has been boarded up with solid 
oak planks of wood.  Surrounding the house there are tall trees 
keeping the house secluded.
