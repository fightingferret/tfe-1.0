Overgrown Path~
You are standing at the western edge of a big forest.  To the west is a
narrow trail, leading through an arch made out of hedges.  To the east,
you can see an overgrown path leading into a dark and forbidding forest.

Archway~
The bushes form an archway directly overhead.  Although the bushes look
green and healthy, they don't appear to have been groomed in a long
time.  A lantern hangs on either side of the arch entrance.  The path
continues west, under the archway and east, back into the forest.

lantern lanterns~
Large lanterns are hung from metal hooks which disappear into the hedges.
~
E
bushes~
The bushes seem to extend as far as the eye can see.  If it weren't for
the thickness of the forest, you might have been able to see where the
line of hedges end.  For now, it appears the only way to proceed is
through the archway or back into the forest.  
~
E
archway~
The archway is caused by the bushes coming together high overhead.  As
you squint to see the arc, you can just make out some lettering.  
~
E
lettering~
Somehow, the foliage in the arc has turned lighter to form a phrase.  The
phrase states, "Castle Lag."

Courtyard~
You can't help but stare at the wonderous beauty of the marble fountain
which stands in the middle of the courtyard.  An archway leads back into
the forest to the east, while gravel paths lead to the north, east and
west.  Surprisingly, the sounds of the water trickling down the fountain
urge you to sit awhile and rest.

fountain~
You see the most elaborate fountain in the known world.  Ornately carved
animals adorn the fountain from top to bottom.  Fresh water cascades down
the sides and into a shallow pool of water.  Despite the apparent
degradation of the surrounding area, the fountain seems to stay in
pristine condition.

The courtyard seems to be as unkempt as the forest to the east.  Yet, the
marble fountain centered in the courtyard, appears to maintain its
beauty.  
~
E
archway~
A large archway stands to the east, beyond which, can be seen a dark and
foreboding forest.

Gravel Path~
Amazingly, the path opens up into a spacious opening surrounded by
oversized thorn bushes.  A rather new-looking statue stands here.  The
figure is of a male faerie, although he is slightly taller than most
faeries.  The stone eyes stare blankly out at you, but you see where the
sculptor added laugh lines near the corners of them.  It looks like a
relaxed face, and the stance of the figure is casual, with one hand on
its hip and the other one extended as if to shake hands with visitors to
this little corner of the garden.  Small chunks of the statue's base have
been hacked away, leaving the chips lying on the ground as evidence of
the misdeed.

Gravel Path~
The bushes have slowed your travel to a mere crawl.  You begin to feel a
strange, foreboding sensation, which causes you to sweat uncontrollably. 
The urgent need to return through the bushes to the west controls all of
your thought processes.  A small opening covered by thorny branches lies
to the east, while the thin trail tapers back to the west.

Bottom of Knoll~
The ground seems to become softer as you walk along between tall hedges. 
The grass in no longer green, but instead, has turned an ugly, brownish
color.  The smell of mud and gunk wafts to your nose from the north.  A
small knoll rises to the west.

Swamp Entrance~
Mud begins to suck at your boots as you force your way through what is
the beginning of a small swamp.  The hedges around you appear to be
suffering from this infernal muck and slime.  The trail of ooze which
makes up this swamp extends to the north and south.
  
A sign stands half buried in the mud here.

Swamp~
You are now waist deep in an oozing slime which attempts to suck you
down.  The dark hedges which line the swamp have taken on an eerie
quality as they strain to contain the murky slime.  You can feel your
skin crawl underneath you clothing.  Fear begins to creep into your
heart.  The swamp seems to continue to the south and west.

You are swimming in a murky swamp which is clearly over your head here. 
Although the tall hedges still surround you on all sides, the job of
containing the swamp appears to be taking its toll.  Spaces can be seen
in the thick branches where some of the muck has forced its way through. 
The swamp continues to the south and east.

rises high into the air.  An iron-bound drawbridge looks to be the only
accessible way to cross the large moat that surrounds the castle.  More
hedges block any further passage south.

Entry Hall~
Rectangular in shape, this entry hall stretches to the east and west,
connecting the mechanism room and entrance to the rest of the castle. 
The entire chamber is austere and lacking in ornamentation.  A small,
wooden door is set into the northern wall while a much larger, more
detailed, door lies broken off its hinges in the west wall.  Deep gouges
have been cut into the south wall of the entry hall.

A long table of polished blue marble dominates the center of this hall. 
Ten chairs carved from the darkest mohagony line up against the stone
walls to the east and west.  Before the table stands a short white
pillar, atop which rests a sealed tome and a large, open book.  A round
ink pot and several quills accompany the open book.  Two wide doors, one

This large, central chamber has a vaulted ceiling of reinforced grey
stone.  Beneath its graceful dome rests a large mosaic of colorful tiles
that takes up the entire floor.  Two great halls, with red carpets
running down their center, extend to the north and south while smaller
passages branch off from this chamber to the west and east.  Torches line
the wall to either side of each passageway, fills the chamber with ample
illumination.

A long, grandiose hall stretches its way to the north and south.  A

Old but colorful tapestries hang from black, iron rods mounted upon
the west and east grey stone walls.  High overhead, a crystal chandelier
is suspended, whose tines sway back and forth like a tree in the wind.  A
spiral stair stands off to one side of the hall, disappearing into the
upper recesses of the castle as it winds up and around.

provided by smoky torches set into sconces upon the columns.  The

columns rise up to meet the ceiling high above at regular intervals,
keeping the chamber's vaulting in place.  Torches set in sconces mounted
to the columns belch for a greasy yellow light and a lot of smoke.  The

Marble columns extend high to the ceiling, supporting an unusual type of

Dank Hall~
Built from square cut blocks of deep gray stone, this hallway corners
leads both to the north and west.  The walls bear neither sconces nor
ornamentation.  Etched into the surface of some of the stones are
snake-like runes.  A fair amount of illumination can be seen coming from
the far north.

Atop an Oubliette~
This dark stone cul-de-sac is about forty feet wide and thirty feet long. 
At its center is a large hole whose rim is lined with sharp metallic
spikes.  Bits of torn leather and other substances best left alone cling
to a good number of the dangerous spikes.  There is very little edge to
speak of surrounding the pit.  A dark hall full of shadowy recess lies to
the east.

Kitchen~
The interior of this kitchen must have been white at one time, but almost
every inch of the walls is covered in a thin layer of sooty grime.  The
remains of once luxurious countertops line the walls, on which lie rusty
kitchen utensils.  Near one of the cupboards stands an old wash basin. 
Near the basin, there is also a large hearth with a black kettle
suspended over it.  A perfectly square opening is set into the south
wall, and beside it hangs a length of rope.  A swinging door hangs from
brass hinges in the west wall while ordinary wooden doors lie to the
south and east.

Great Hall~
This long, elegant hall is resplendent with bright paintings and a
plushred carpet that runs down its length.  Tall statues stand at the
entrance to the smaller hallways which run from east to west.  From thin,
iron chains mounted in the ceiling hang large candelabras made of copper. 
The great hall extends to the north and south.

doors.  Four statues occupy this part of the great hall, each framing one
side of the latter two passages.  A chandelier of tarnished silver and
dusty crystal tines hangs high above the floor.

Great Hall~
This grand hall reaches an end to the north, but continues onward to the
south out of view.  The edges of the red carpet here are tattered and
frayed.  Two smaller halls branch off from the northern end of the great
hall.  The western passage is framed by a pair of tall, armored statues
and a shorter, more solemn statue, stands beside the eastern passage. 
Overhead, illuminating this part of the hall with its numerous candles,
hangs a crystal chandelier.

Prison Doorway~
Even though the walls in this hallway are grey in color, you can see the
dirt and grime streaking their surfaces.  It looks as if the cleaning of
this passage has been neglected for a long time.  Along the floor are
several deep scuffs and scratches, as though something were dragged
across it.  The trail of struggle marks ends at the base of a stury iron
door set into the east wall.  The door is large and has a grill set into
it. To the west, in all its splendor, lies the great hall.

Prison~
The interior of this prison cell is a vast, empty expanse with walls of
white marble.  The marble has a smooth, polished surface.  A large iron
door with a window grill is set into the west wall and it has neither
lock nor handle.  You also can see virtually no cracks where the door
should be.  The marble texture of the wall meshes nearly seamlessly with
the door.

Hall~
A short hallway branches off from the great hall, which lies just to the
east.  This hall continues west, ending at the threshold of a large,
iron door.  The most dominating feature of this hall, though, is neither
its length nor the door at its end.  Rather, upon the north wall hangs a
massive painting of a well-armored warrior fighting a colossal red dragon.

An immense bed sits against the far wall of this room, beneath a pair of

A large desk rests against the northern wall.  A sturdy iron door is the
only way in or out of the extravagant bedchamber.

The desk is made out of the same reddish-brown wood that the bedframe is

are a number of maps and letters which look like battle plans.

E
tapestries~
The tapestries are immense in size and are woven out of fine silk.  The
pictures woven are of warriors battling towards victory over throngs of
evil monstrosities.  One certain warrior in the tapestries seems to catch
your attention.  The face seems familar, but from where you are not sure.
~
E
chest~
The chest is made out of solid oak and is reinforced by iron bands.  An
ornate crest is carved into the front and sides of the chest.  The crest
is of a shield with a dragon emblazoned on it and two swords crossed over
the shield.  The latch is in the shape of a dragon and the mouth looks
like the keyhole.
~
E
swords~
Mounted above the bed, these two swords are distinctly different but both
seem to radiate power.  One of the swords has a purple hue to the metal
and occasionally crackles with energy.  The other sword is an impressive
sword made out of a strange glass.  Within the sword, the magic that
created it swirls slowly in a mist of colors.
~
E
bed~
The large bedframe is made out of a beautiful reddish-brown wood.  Ornate
carvings of vines and mythical beasts are etched around the entire frame. 
The mattress is also of fine quality, filled with feathers rather than
straw, creating an especially nice place to sleep.

Hall of Wonders~
This long hall appears to be a gallery of sorts.  As it continues
eastward from the great hall, this stone corridor becomes cluttered with
white marble pedestals.  Atop the pedestals are strange and unusual
devices enclosed in domes of glass.  A door bound with bands of iron is
set into the east end of the hall.  Much of the hall, while clean, looks
to be falling into disrepair.

are several black marble pedestals, atop each stands an unusual and
expensive-looking vase.  Each vase has its own distinct features.  A
great hall with a red carpet running down its center lies just to the
east.

The beds are simple straw mattresses thrown onto a wooden frame.  The

Short Hall~
Compared to the great hall just to the west, this passage through the
castle is quite short.  The hallway ends here, at the threshold of
light pinewood door.  The only ornamentation in this hallway is a single,
ancient painting which has begun to fade.  The portrait depicts a gallant
warrior standing before an enormous castle.

Hall~
This corridor of stone stretches to the west for a long way, until it at

spots where decorations might once have adorned.  The floor, The floor of

Guards' Quarters~
This rectangular stone room has a rather austere ambience to it.  While
it has a number of pieces of furniture, each piece is extremely simple
and lacking in originality.  Eight beds are scattered about the room,
with a single grey blanket covering each.  At the foot of each bed is a
small chest.  In the center of the room is a round table whose surface is
littered with food and playing cards.  A cherry wood door is set into the
east wall.

Small, Empty Room~
Small and empty, this chamber appears to have little use in the castle. 
A few boxes are piled in the far corner of the room, along with a couple

of these and the floor thickly.  A door, fashioned from light pinewood,

Escape Tunnel~
Hewn from solid stone, a secret tunnel has been carved out from behind
the king's throne.  In days of old, and perhaps sooner, this tunnel was
likely used as an escape route for the king and his family.  The tunnel
extends far to the south.  Old torch sconces, long since turned green
from corrosion, line the sides of the east and west walls at even
interwalls.  On the east wall, you can see the faint outlines of the
throne's back.

Secret Tunnel~
Constructed of stone the color of a white shirt after a hundred of so
washings, this stone passageway is in a surprising good condition,
considering its apparent age.  Although the tunnel is narrow and cramped,
there is still enough space for easy passage.  A wall of stone and brick
has been erected to the south as a means of sealing off the secret
passage from the rest of the tunnels.  Dented but empty torch sconces
made of brass are set into the sides of the tunnel's walls.  Judging from
the amount of dust and dirt on the stone floor, this passage has been
here for many, many years.

Within this vaulted stone chamber lies a mass of wealth.  Piles of coins,

out of the heaps are several chests and gems that would make even a
pirate envious.  A heavy layer of dust covers the treasure though, as if
it has not been disturbed for many years.  The only exit from the stone
vault lies to the south.

Covering the drab walls, these tapestries bring color and life to the

in the foreground of the picture, a small party of adventurers prepare
for battle.

The small crystals are strung together and dangle gently below the
candles of the candelabra.  These clear stones have been cut to catch and
refract light into many different colors.  Certain crystals seem to
have been cut differently and produce only one color.

pain line the shelves to the south.  The counters to the east are adorned
with machines and instruments of oddly grotesque designs to evoke the
most pain a body can take and still live.  Straps criss-cross the large

1 west~
The first painting shows the hero standing above a grave holding a blue
rose.  In the background you see what is left standing of a fireplace. 
Looking close a single red tear streams down the hero's face.  The
picture next to it shows as the hero delivers the killing blow to a
obsidian armored warrior.  Unfortunatly the wounds the hero sustained are
great and the hero also dies.  Behind the battle the outline of the
hero's spouse smiles gently ready to be reunited.
~
E
1 south~
The paintings on this wall show a different view of the hero.  One
painting shows the hero in front of a small home tending a garden.  In
the background of the picture sits the sword etched with red runes.  The
other picture shows the hero relaxing in front of a fireplace.  The
hero's spouse stands behind gently messaging the shoulders of her beloved.
~
E
1 east~
The life of the hero continues on this wall.  The paintings on this wall
depict the hero during the early adulthood.  One of the paintings shows
the hero dressed in leather jerkin pulling a sword etched with red runes
from a block of ruby.  In the other picture the hero stands over a dragon. 
The red runed sword is embedded deep in the skull of the dragon.
~
E
1 north~
The paintings on the north wall show scenes of the hero's youth.  The
first painting shows the young hero defending a friend from a grizzly
bear wielding nothing more than a goat's horn.  The other picture depicts
the hero severing the head off of a granite statue in a town square.
~
E
paintings~
There are eight paintings in the room, two on each wall.  The paintings
seem to tell a story about a legendary human hero.  In the corner of the
paintings are the letters KGD.
~
E
6 objects art~
The objects do not seem to be of this world.  Such colors swirling and
churning have never been seen or touched this dimension.  The dancing
colors ebb and flow mixing and reforming to create marvels that exist
only in the essense of dreams and imagination.
~
E
busts~
The busts are sculpted out of a beautiful blue stone.  The stone is
finely cut and has been smoothed down to give the sculptures a look of
realism.  One of the busts looks strangely familiar to the person in the
paintings.
~
E
statues~
The statues are made out of pure crystal.  Looking over the artwork there
seems to be no flaws anywhere in the crystal.  The features have been
smoothed so that there are no hard edges.  The statues seem to be of past
royalty that had at one time lived in this castle and admired this same
art.
~
E
treasures~
This room is filled with all kinds of artwork from all over the world. 
Statues of pure crystal stand in the room flanked by beautiful blue busts. 
In the middle of the room sits an unusual object that seems to produce
strange colors.  Covering all the walls of the room are painting that are
a beautiful example of realism.  Everything in the room looks valuable
and unique to this place alone.
~
E
statues~
There are an uncountable number of statues in this room.  All of the
statues are made of crystal, but they vary in size and subject matter. 
Over here is a dragon breathing fire, over there a knight standing at
attention.
~
E
busts~
The busts are made of different types of materials- crystal, stone, and
marble to name a few.  The busts have o names inscribed at the bases, so
it's hard to tell which god, goddess, or person they are supposed to be
of.
~
E
paintings~
The paintings all show mighty featsbeing accomplished by people.  There
is more than one picture of a person in armor slaying a dragon and other
incredible feats.  There are also a few profiles of people.  The one that
stands out the most is the picture of a man riding the back of a dragon
like a steed.

Entrance to the Tomb~
Here you see a small passage leading down which seems to have not been
used in quite sometime.  closer inspection shows that the door has been
locked.  An very strange mystical feeling surrounds you as you think
about entering here.
  
This is actually a dup of room 9052 and will be replaced by that room
when it is ready.
