Small Brick Tunnel~
Ancient bricks make up the walls, ceiling and floor of this small
tunnel.  The red-clay bricks have been stained by the passage of time as
well as watermarks.  The mortar between the bricks is decaying, and is
powdery to the touch.  The floor is covered in a thin layer of silt, and
the unmistakable tracks left by rats.  The thin tunnel leads north,
while a metal grate above you provides the only other way out.

bricks walls ceiling mortar~
The red-clay bricks from which this narrow passage is constructed are
old, cracked and broken in spots, corners worn and rounded with age. 
Dark stains, the memories of dripping and flowing water, mark the tunnels
walls and the crumbling mortar that barely holds the bricks in place. 
Blacker even than the watermarks, patches of mildew lend the air a
faintly musty smell.

E
floor silt tracks~
The tunnel floor, buried beneath a thin layer of silt, clearly shows the
tracks of rats...  very large rats.  Countless in number, the tracks lead
into this area from the north and back out.
~
E
grate~
Planted firmly in the tunnel's roof, an iron grate gives entrance to and
exit from the sewers.  Although covered with dark orange patches of rust,
the grate is still solid and heavy.

Narrow Brick Tunnel~
Red-brick walls surround you on four sides, leaving a tight tunnel that
leads north and south.  The bricks are old, worn and stained by the
passage of sewage long ago.  The tunnel tilts slowly upward towards the
north, where in the distance there is a reddish glow.  You can follow the
passage either north or south.

bricks walls tunnel~
The tunnel is close and cramped, surrounding you on four sides with
cracked and aging bricks.  Running halfway up the wall, a dark stain
defines the level of flowing sewage and the purpose these tunnels once
served.  At one point, just above the waterline, you see a section of
wall where the bricks are clearly loose, only held in place by a minimal
amount of mortar.

Brick Tunnel - Before the Copper Door~
The brick tunnel is blocked to the north by a massive copper door.  On
each side of the door, set into deep niches are red, glowing balls of
light.  The balls float in midair, and give off a reddish glow that
reflects off the copper door.  The door has no apparent handle or hinges
on its decorated face.  To your south is a long brick tunnel that leads
slightly downwards.

carvings door 1 north copper~
The short stretch of tunnel ends abruptly at a tall copper door.  Shadows
cast from nearby scarlet spheres enhance carvings beaten into its surface. 
These carvings, though crude, depict the very essence of evil.  Man-sized
rodents - bipedal rats - carry out various methods of torture and murder
on hapless victims.  One particularly grisly scene shows them stripping
the flesh from a living, human child then throwing those chunks of 'meat'
into a bubbling, boiling cauldron.  One of the carvings looks worn, as if
it has been touched many times.
~
E
niches light ball~
Flanking the door, deep niches hold glowing balls of light the size of a
large fist.  The lights are red, a dark crimson color reminiscent of
spilling blood.  Reflecting off the portal, the spheres cast eerie
shadows across its carven face.

Granite Hallway~
The walls and ceiling of this hallway are sheathed in polished black
granite, cut through with violent swirls of a pinkish hue.  A large
archway is cut into the south wall, inset with a burnished copper door. 
The floor is red flagstone, and is also polished to a high sheen.  You
can head east or west down the hallway.  Next to the archway is a small
metal plate about three feet off the ground.

wall ceiling granite~
Sheathed in what appears to be a single piece of solid black granite, the
cramped tunnel flows east and west.  Highly polished, the stone absorbs

archway copper door 1 south~
An archway, curved and slightly askew as though crafted by an amateur's hand,
showcases a burnished copper door that lies on the southern wall.  Beaten
into the door, crude carvings of a malevolent nature portray gruesome
scenes.  One such scene shows a massive rat, clad in flowing robes,
gouging the eye from an unfortunate elven victim.

E

Thick slabs of rusty red flagstone forge the floor of the narrow

Granite Hallway~
The polished granite hallway deadends here, coming upon two heavy
iron-bound wooden doors.  One door is set into the north wall, while the
other is in the east wall.  The polished slate floor is covered in
stains, deep-purple upon the already red stone.  Aside from entering the
doors you can head west down a long hallway.

Two doors, each the mirror-image of the other, obstruct the black granite
passageway to the north and east.  Fashioned from solid planks of

iron bands enwrapping them, both horizontally and vertically.  Issuing
from gaps beneath the doors and the rusty-red floor, rises a stench of
unknown origin.

Deep purple stains, nearly black in color, have seeped into the porous

Cell~
Bare brick walls covered in filth and spattered blood are all you see
here.  A thin layer of straw has been spread over the floor, in a failed
attempt to bring meager comfort to any imprisoned here.  This room is
uncomfortable at best, the brick floor poking through the straw.  The
only way out is through a heavy, iron-bound door to the south.

The cold and damp floor is blanketed by a thin covering of straw, strewn
about the room.  A sizable clump has been collected along the far wall,
perhaps an attempt at creating a bed, and several discolored and filthy
scraps of clothing peek out from the mottled patch.  Further
investigation reveals the gruesome world that lives beneath the meager

Uneven rows of weathered bricks comprise the walls of the cell,
alternating shades of grey beneath the filth that clings to the stone. 
Like the work of a demented artist, splotches of dull and darkened

Cell~
This small cell has bare brick walls and straw strewn about the floor. 
Leg irons are bolted to the wall in the northeast corner, the shackles
have long since been broken.  There are several small holes in the wall
just at floor level.  The only way out of this cell is west, through a
heavy iron-bound door.

chained leg shackle~
A reminder of the nature of the room, a long and rusted iron chain
stretches from a bolt in the stained and filthy grey brick wall opposite
the door.  The leg iron ends in a battered and broken shackle, the
recipient of countless hours of abuse and perhaps frantic bashing.
~
E
holes wall~
The base of each of the walls is dotted by cracks and small holes, the
result of poor construction, the dripping of water through the soil, and
no doubt owing to the diligent efforts of the room's former occupants. 
Occasionally the small shadow of a rodent emerges from the holes to watch
your movements with alarming interest.

Granite Hallway~
The polished granite walls are cold, as is the air that flows silently
past you.  Large red slate slabs make up the floor, which reflects onto
the glossy surface of the ceiling and walls.  The granite walls are shot
through with spidery veins of a sickly pink color.  The long hallway
leads west and east.

Granite Hallway~
The granite hallway runs east and west, leading towards a turn in the
hallway and some doors to the west.  The floor is made of a polished red
flagstone.  Inset in the north wall is a carved archway, bordered on each
side by red granite pillars with golden flecks.  Inside the archway is a
carved oaken door.

Looming over the gnarled oaken door is a well-crafted archway carved from

each seeming to snake its way down the sloping sides to fade into mere
random scratches near the ground.  Flanking the archway like guardians of
a sacred portal, two red granite pillars riddled with golden flecks
support the sides of the inset stone with silent symmetry.

Priest's Room~
This chamber is sheathed in red velvet curtains hung from iron hooks on
the walls.  The floor is covered in a thick black carpet, and cushions
are spread all over the floor as well.  A small black-granite altar sits
along the west wall.  The north wall has a tapestry hanging from it,
displaying scenes of a vile nature.  The south wall has a intricately
carved oaken door in it.

Three sides of the chamber are draped in scarlet, rich-textured velvet
that hangs in deep folds from simple iron hooks affixed near the ceiling. 
The hems of the heavy fabric brush an ebon carpet, plush and deep-piled,
that covers the floor.  Scattered around the room, over-stuffed cushions
are strategically placed around a black granite altar.
~
E
altar~
Cries of torment and the unholy chanting of hissing voices seem to writhe
behind the walls and beneath the heavy cloak of silence, like echoes of
power and fear etched deep within the stones of this chamber.  Nestled
within a shroud of overlapping shadows, this altar of darkened stone
absorbs the light of the ensconced torches as though it hungered for
their very essence.  Lines and rivulets run the length of the slab,
darkened permanently by layers of black soot and stains of crimson.  Like
veins they flow along the edge of the altar to small and barely-visible
holes, only to reappear stains with even brighter red as they spiral down
the carved legs and onto the cold, stone steps.
~
E
tapestry~
Like a long drawn veil, the tapestry hides the northern wall, a myriad of
colors and threads.  The cloth is quite fine, the detailed art clearly
the work of a skilled weaver.  A striking scene of despair and torture
unfolds across the center of the tapestry, figures, of various races
being impaled, burned, even devoured by a horde of demonic creatures that
faintly resemble large, armored rodents.  Several smaller scenes flank
the larger, decorating the perimeter with assorted symbols and pictures
of the worship of a dark deity.  Below the landscape of roving creatures
and wailing figures, the image of a pit descends into shadow, and only by
the slight variation in thread and two bright red eyes, is the image of a
looming beast in the depths of the tapestry revealed.

Granite Hallway~
The polished granite hallway turns here, heading north and east.  A heavy
wooden door is set into an arch in the west wall, and an iron-bound door
in the south.  The floor is polished slate, in a checkerboard pattern of
red and black.  To the east a long hallway runs, while to the north you
see a wider hallway.

Common Room~
The walls and floor of this large room are brick and stained with age and
covered in filth.  Old rugs, clothes and other useless items are piled in
heaps around the room, making it quite cluttered and dingy.  The ceiling
is a barrel-vault constructed of brick, and covered with cobwebs.  There
are several small holes in the base of the walls, and rat prints are
quite plainly seen.  A heavy wooden door in the east wall provides the
only means of exit.

This room has red-brick walls, and is bare except for worn sleeping mats

The floor here is polished black slate, reflecting the flickering light
of a brazier set along the east wall.  The flames are also reflected off
the shiny surface of the black-granite walls.  Set along the sides of the
wide corridor are four pillars on each side.  The pillars are a deep-red
marble, sliced through with black veins.  To the north you can see a
large chamber, while to the south you see a turn in the granite hallway.

Temple of the Rat God~
You are in the center of a large domed chamber.  The walls are covered in
beaten copper, and reflect an eerie and shadowy light from the burning
braziers off to the east and west.  Before you, to the north, is a huge
statue of a giant humanoid rat learing evilly into the chamber.  In front
of the statue is a stark black altar, crafted of a deep-black granite.
A long hallway leads south.

In the distance, dominating the northern wall of the expansive room, the
giant statue emerges from the shadows to pass its gaze across the chamber. 
Twisted and deformed, the figure stands with arms outstretched, and the
shrouded eyes glint red in the flicker of firelight.  The soft glow of
the braziers limns the silhouette of a large stone table, as black as the
floor beneath your feet.

E
beaten walls~
Plates of copper line the stone walls, like hundreds of dark, shattered
mirrors.  The metal is battered and beaten, but untarnished by rust,
casting a myriad of deep golden and brown reflections upon the
roughly-carved ceiling.  The mere flicker of the brazier's flame upon the
dented copper sends a multitude of pale lights dancing across the
polished floor.  The western wall seems slightly darker than the east
though perhaps, its just a trick of the uneven glow that lights the room.

At the Feet of the Statue~
You are at the foot of a towering statue of a massive humanoid rat. 
In front of the statue rests a heavy altar of black granite.  The top
of the altar is shaped like a large oval bowl; roomy enough to hold a large
human.  Behind the statue, the walls of beaten copper gleam in the
eerie light.  To the south is the main area of the temple.

altar~
Low and wide, a solid block of black granite lies at the base of a
monolithic statue that dominates the room.  Cut into the top of the altar
is a long, shallow indentation, roughly oval and large enough to form a
rocky bed for a large human.  The altar is dull and flat, its surface
permanently dulled by the oozing blood of sacrificial victims.
~
E
walls~
The walls of beaten copper form a glistening backdrop for the towering
statue.  Flames from distant braziers dance fitfully off the slick
surface to brush the statue, making it almost seem to move.
