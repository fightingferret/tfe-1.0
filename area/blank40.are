Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
Through the eddying mists you can see the base of a large tree.  It
towers high above you, its canopy of leaves blocking out both the
sunlight and any view of the upper limbs of this woodland giant.  It is
hard to see the shadowy boles of other nearby trees in the dense mist.

>> Up this tree is entrance to Tasloi area <<

Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
You stand on a small path that runs north and south through the woods. 
You could easily leave the path and head off into the woods to the east
or west.  A mist permeates the air here, making it hard to see far in any
direction.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You stand at the top of a frighteningly frail-looking platform lashed to
branches with vines.  There are many holes through which you can see the
forest floor far below you.  Branches just below the platform appear to
offer convenient hand-holds for a climb down.  To the south, a fairly
large branch of the tree has been lashed to the branch of an adjoining
tree with thick forest vines, creating a natural walkway.

4 holes~
The view from here is dizzying to one not born into such a lifestyle. 
The ground is several spans higher than most tall buildings and a fall
could quite possibly kill you.
~
E
platform frail ~
The platform is a combination of heavily woven reed thatch and logs. 
Small stumps stick out of the logs where branches where inexpertly hacked
off, creating serious tripping hazards.  The thatch's frail appearance
belies its appearant strength as you have not fallen though it yet.
~
E
1 south walkway~
Perhaps the work of many years' tending, this is an impressive feat. 
Someone, or something, has taken the time to tend these branches until
they grew close enough together that they could be lashed simply with
ropes to form a stable walkway.  The branches themselves are obviously
many years' old and quite possibly sturdy enough to support a large orge
or troll.  rdesc 7 Other branches nearby appear to form natural
hand-holds for those lacking any natural dexterity.

Broad Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You stand on a rough platform hidden high in the branches of the
forest canopy.  To the north you see two large tree branches lashed
securely together to form a natural walkway.  Several fairly straight
small logs form a frail-looking bridge to your south, leading to another
platform.  There are many vines here, draped loosely over the tree
branches to the east.

Platform around the Upper Trunk of a Tree~
The platform here is balanced around the branches growing out of the
upper trunk of a tree.  Logs and thick thatch are stacked and wedged up
against each other to give it all a pretty level appearance.  The
platform extends for quite a few feet in all directions of the trunk,
allowing comfortable movement to any side of the tree.  While most of the
branches at this level have been hacked off to facilitate easier
movement, two remain.  The branches rest roughly on the south and east
sides of the tree and are laden with loosely draped vines.

You stand on a platform hidden in the leafy branches of a large tree. 
The branches surounding you are quite thick yet you notice you can easily
see a small clearing on the forest floor south of where you are.  You
think you could easily use a bow to hit people in the clearing and still
remain concealed from them up here.  To the west you can see another
platform in a nearby tree that is connected to this one by a large branch. 
Several vines are draped loosely over branches to your north.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
The thatch of this platform seems a bit thin.  Perhaps you should be
careful where you step.  There is a hole near one edge where it appears
some one else wasn't so careful and fell through.  To the east you can
make out another platform in a nearby tree.  A branch here seems large
enough to support your weight and leads eastward, where it comes rather
close to a branch on the other tree.  You think you could make it safely
across to the other platform.  There are some vines draped over branches
nearby to the south.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You have managed to make it to a rather small; cramped platform.  There
is maybe five feet of clearance between the platform and the tangle of
branches above it.  The platform itself is rather small, fortunately, the
branches around it provide plenty of footing as well.  You have an
unimpeded sight of a small clearing on the forest floor to your east. 
This would appear to be an excellent place to set up an ambush for anyone
crossing the forest floor.  You see many vines hanging on nearby branches.
~

Large Platform with Plenty of Room~
You have made it to a rather large platform that appears well tended. 
You can see newer logs where old ones have been replaced and all the
lashings seem secure and sturdy.  All about are the signs that many
people come through and spend much time here.  The older logs are worn
smooth from the pounding of many feet.  All about are the prints of many
small muddy feet and hands.  In one corner, you see an elevated platform,
almost like a dais meant for a speaker.  A rough ladder of wooden logs
has been lashed to the trunk of the tree and leads to another platform
visible higher in the tree.  On the periphery of the platform are vines
in all directions.

Platform hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You are on another platform concealed high in the canopy of the forest. 
This one is well concealed by many branches and leaves.  The southwestern
corner of this platform is covered by a low ceiling of bundled reeds and
branches, forming a sort of rain shelter.  Off to the west you can
vaguely make out the shape of perhaps some kind of large nest or shelter,
however there seems to be no way of getting to it safely.  Branches to
east hold many vines draped loosely over branches.  To your north a
narrow bridge of logs lashed together leads to the branches of another
tree.

The platform here is sheltered by many bundled branches sealed by mud and
leaves overhead.  The overhead coverage slants increasingly downward
until it actually touches the southern and eastern sides of the platform,
forming a sort of wind shelter.  A small pile of debris is cluttered in
the corner of the makeshift shelter.  Off to your west you notice several
large branches that have been lashed together by many vines.  Any gaps
between them are covered by thatch and small logs.  Branches on the north
side of the platform have vines draped loosely over them.

You are at what remains of the top of a tree.  Where its majestic spire
must have once stood, now rests a broad platform of reed bundles.  The
platform is wide enough for even a large horse or two to stand on, if
they could manage to get up through the narrow opening at its center. 
The hole in the platform leads back down into the forest canopy.
~
there will wasp-riding tasloi as soon as they can mount the wasps.

Set move down to check for wasp, no move down.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
There is little space to stand on this platform as it is little more than
3 small logs lashed to a branch.  It seems to be more of a stopping
point between branches.  Fortunately, the branches of this tree are
large enough and near enough to provide stable footing if you are
cautious.  A narrow bridge is nearby to the south leading to another tree. 
A few planks lashed to the tree's trunk seem to form a sort of ladder
leading up into higher branches.

hastily carved with some sharp object.  Hanging from one branch a short
ways off you can see several small fairies tied together like a string of
rabbits.  The area is filled with an ample ammount of insects, all
crawling over the rotting corpses hanging here.  The only available exit
appears to be the branches tied together and overlaid with occassional
thatch off to the east.

A vine is lashed around the feet of the dead fairies.  They all hang

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
The branches here are particularly thick around the platform you are on. 
Some are tied back a bit, while others seem to have been pruned or tended
by someone.  The overall intent seems to be to make this platform well
hidden while providing an excellent view of a small clearing to the north
and south on the forest floor.  A narrow log bridge leads off to the
east, also concealed from the ground by branches.  Several vines are
draped loosely over branches to the west of the platform.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You have arrived at a rather busy area of small platforms and connecting
wide logs.  Many small platforms are nestled among the branches of this
tree, all connected by carefully tended wide branches or rough-hewn
logs.  A simple bridge of logs and thatch leads to another tree to the
north.  Another simple bridge of similar construction leads east. 
Leading up from one small platform near the trees trunk are several
branches almost forming a spiral stair leading further up into the tree. 
The branches to your south support many vines leading up higher into the
forest canopy.

You have made it to the top of this tree, or at least, what remains of
its top.  Where this tree's top would once have stood majestically over
its many companions, now rests a large platform supported by the

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
You are on a platform hidden high in the canopy of the forest.  The
platform is constructed of rough-hewn logs and thick thatch help together
by vines.  From where you are, you can see only small glimpses of the
ground far below through the branches of the tree as they shift in the
light breeze.  A crude bridge of logs leads west to a series of platforms
in another tree.  The branches on the east side of this tree are laden
with vines within comfortable reaching distance.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
The platform here is weatherworn and smooth.  The tread of many feet upon
it has long since worn away any burrs or splinters.  Signs that many
beings travel through here are abundant.  From the crude berry-dye
pictures of animals scrawled on branches to the sword-like slashes
marking some of the older branches.  Carefully tended openings in the
branches give you an unimpeded view of a clearing on the forest floor
west of here.  You realize you could easily use this spot to ambush
anyone in that clearing.  A crude, unsafe looking vine bridge leades off
to the south.  To the north and east of the platform, on nearby branches,
you see many vines loosely draped.

The platform in this tree is spattered by bits of black and darkened red
gore.  Flies and other insects are here in abundance, climbing over a few
gnawed bones left unattended in one corner.  Hanging from ropes in the
tree you can see slabs of raw meat in various shapes and sizes.  The
stench alone is almost overpowering.  A few vines are draped over a small
wooden post on the platforms west edge.

You reach out and pull one of the ropes toward you.  A closer inspection
reveals it to be tied around the ankle of a leg, still clad in scraps of
forest green breeches.  It appears to be the right size to have been the
leg of an elf, or perhaps a human.  Another look around shows that almost

obviously not the skull of any animal.  By the skulls size you would
guess it to be elven or human.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
The platform you are on is slightly bowed in the middle.  The branches
it rests on are far enough apart that there is too little support in the
middle and years of weight and weathering have caused it to bow in the
middle.  Despite the warping of the platform, it still remains sturdy
enough to hold a significant amount of weight.  A narrow wooden bridge
leads off to the west, offering a spectacular view of the ground far
below.  To the north you see a makeshift vine bridge that looks a bit
shakey.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
The platform surrounds the tree trunk and extends out for a few feet in
all directions, making it look more like a walkway then a platform.  Most
of the branches have been pruned off at this level to allow easier
movement.  The only remaining branches appear to form a natural ladder
leading up higher into the tree.  Vines have been loosely draped over
a small post on the north side of the platform.

Platform Hidden in the Forest Canopy~
A large square platform of reeds is supported by the truncated trunks and
branches of many trees.  Its purpose is not exactly clear, as nearby
trees prohibit any decent view of the surrounding treescape.  Unless you
are adept at flight, the only visible means of exit appears to be a hole
in the platforms center, where the reeds are tied back.

The branches of this tree appear to have been pruned to create a natural
ladder leading down to it.  Other branches on this tree have been lashed
close together and lined with thatch, allowing easy access to a larger

You stand atop a wooden platform, secured to branches by thick vines.
Many of the rough-hewn logs are loose and some are missing.
The branches all about you are covered in colorful runes.  The majority
of the symbols exist near a series of ladder-like branches leading
further up into the tree.  Off to the east and west you see other small
platforms surrounded by small mud and leaf hut-like structures, but you
see no safe way to reach them.  Branches of this tree have been tied to
branches of nearby trees and covered with rough-hewn logs, allowing
easy access to trees north and south of here.

A Strange Hut at the Tree's Crest~
You have climbed up through a hole in the bottom of the platform only to
find you have entered an odd little hut.  It is constructed primarily of
branches and leaves held together by mud and vines.  Herbs hang from
various branches around the hut giving the whole place an unusual and
musty smell.  A small wooden table holds an assortment of odd bowls,
jars, and simple tools of wood and stone.  A small iron dish holds the
smoking ember remains of a fire.

The table is squat and sturdy, resting a mere 18 inches above the floor. 
A small stool near it allows its owner to work comfortably at it.  The
Jars and bowls atop it hold an assortment of odd dyes and pigments, old
feathers, berries, and what appear to be animal entrails.  As you watch,
you think you can see something moving in a few of the jars.

iron dish~
The dish is concave and has three supporting feet.  Its insides are sooty

any practical use or worth.

A Wide Platform High in the Forest Canopy~
This platform is constructed of well-laid thatch, smooth and with very
few gaps.  The lashings are firm and free of rot.  Though the thatch
appears to be relatively new, it shows signs of heavy traffic.  The
inhabitants of this place must travel through here often.  To the west a
bridge of carved logs rests, leading to another platform.  A small bridge
of thatch and small logs leads to a small, covered platform in a tree
north of here.  Branches hold loosely draped vines to the east and south.

Covered Platform in the Forest Canopy~
This platform is covered from above by another platform.  There is only
about 4 feet between the two platforms, causing any of the taller races
to duck to enter.  A fight in here could be quite uncomfortable for
anyone tall.  Some of the branches have been cleared away, giving you a
decent sight of a small clearing on the forest floor north of here.  A
small bridge of logs and thatch leading south appears to be the only exit.

A Well Tended Platform in the Forest Canopy~
The platform here is made of the smoothest logs you have seen in these
tree-tops.  The tread of many feet has brought the platform's surface to
a near sanded finish.  To the north, west, and south small walls of
smooth logs have been erected, giving this place an official look. 
Sitting squarely in the center of the western wall is a small carved
chair on a raised dais.  To the left of the dais a small spiral stair of
logs is secured to the trunk of a large tree, leading up into a wooden
structure near the trees top.  To the east, a bridge of wooden logs
leads to another platform.

Several Platforms Leading up a Tree~
The platforms here form a sort of stair-like pattern winding their way up
the tree.  The lowest and largest platform appears to be a landing point
and has several vines draped over branches near it.  Each platform has
branches leading to the next one up as they spiral around the tree,
leading up through a hole in a larger platform.  Off to the south you can
see platforms in other trees surrounded by small structures of mud and
leaves.  The only way to them appears to be a sole vine hanging on a
branch to the south.
~
vine south is a trap of sorts, drop player in woods.
there really is no way to get to dwellings. yet. :)

A Small Wooden Structure hidden high in the Trees~
This oversized box is formed of wooden logs firmly lashed together.
The cracks have all been sealed by mud and clay, making the only entrance
a small opening in the structure's floor.  One corner is lined by
tattered furs and scraps of cloth, perhaps a sleeping area.  Oddly
enough, a large ironbound chest rests on the other side of the structure. 
The chest is too large to fit through the hole, thus the structure must
have been built around it.

and you can see a little more of the forest now.  Rough-barked trees
covered in dense ivies and creepers seem to comprise the bulk of the

The plants appear to be a combination of primarily leafy green ferns,

you can make out two particularly large bushes with bark darker than the
trees' covering their thick branches and long, narrow leaves veined in

Mist Shrouded Forest~
The mist is present here but appears somewhat thinner and easier to see
through.  You can make out several large ferns growing nearby in a
cluster.  The leafy fronds create ominous shapes in the obscuring mist.

Their fronds make them appear almost to be squat goblins with many arms
awaiting to ambush you.  Stalks growing out of their center almost appear
to be spears held upright in their hands.  You'd almost swear you saw one
move away into the mist, but of course that would be impossible.

1 west 1 south southwest~
A huge bush arcs around you from west to south, almost as if trying to
grab you in some immense hand to crush you.  The branches of the bush are
as thick as an ogre's arm in most places, and tufted with deep green
leaves veined in crimson.  It looks as if a break in the branches occurs
to both the north west and southeast of here.

All about you the sound of leaves rustling, or perhaps it is whispering,
can be heard.  The strange concatenation of sounds and muted sights make

Mist Shrouded Forest~
Tree trunks appear and disapear through the shifting mists of this forest.

Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
The mist thins some here, making it possible to see a bit more of the
forest at once.  Tall trees reach high above you filtering all the
sunlight, creating a garden in eternal shade.  Greenery of many varieties
is visible, from small shoots to a particularly ancient looking bush to
the north.  Off to the east, a path leading to a clearing is barely
visible through the thinned mist.  To the west the mist seems even
thicker, yet you can just make out the half of the path.

otherwise smooth surface.  To the east and south, the sheer volume of

Mist Shrouded Forest~
As you walk you must part veils of both mist and web.  While the mist
parts with the ease of the warm breeze, the webs foil your attempts to
part with them.  These woods appear as a vision in a dream, or a
nightmare.  To the east, the web-covered forest growth becomes too thick
to travel through.

Several extremely large patterns of webbing combine here to form a large
net.  The webbing has many holes in it from previous victims who were,
perhaps, lucky enough to escape.  Several silk-wrapped cocoons remain
where others were not so lucky.  To the north and east, thick forest
undergrowth prevents passage.

Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
The animal sounds from this forest have an almost surreal quality to them. 
Unidentifiable shrieks of terror are often preceded by the deep base
rumbling growls of some predator.  Then, as suddenly as they start, the
sounds will stop and the forest is dead quiet.  You can just make out the
faint path as it continues to stretch east and west of here.

The bush's thick limbs are dark with heavy bark and covered in narrow,

Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
Tall trees and dense little bushes appear as gray shapes in the swirling
mists.  The sounds of the forest surround you and seem to be everywhere
and nowhere as the strange mist filters them.  A narrow path lined by
trees leaves north and south of here.

The looming trees reach high into the mist, disapearing quickly.  Only

between the trees mark the presence of the narrow-leaved bushes common to
this area.

Mist Shrouded Forest~
As you walk, trees seem to solidify out of ghostly forms in the mist as
you walk.  As you come close by them, their dark, twisted bark takes on a
more sinister look in the hazy light.  The forest is dead quite now, as
if something passing by has frightened off the wild life.

Faint Path Through the Woods~
The warm air around you starts to feel thick with moisture and you can
see a very ominous bank of mist forming to the east.  The trees seem to
be changing as well, becoming darker and older to the east.  A small
trail, cleared of leaves by recent use, runs generally west and east here.

You hear a soft burbling sound coming from near by through the mists.  It

spring causing the sound.  Small ferns grow around the edge of the spring. 
The mist west of here appears devoid of extraneous shape or shadow, and
after a cursory examination you find a sudden, deadly drop before you.

Underground Cave~
You stand on a sandy beach in what appears to be a cave of some sort. 
Water splashed off rocks in the river glisten off every wall.  The
rushing sound of the churning water reverberates off the close walls
making the roar almost deafening.  The water rushes in from the north and
continues off to the east.  There is an opening in the southern wall you
think you'd be able to squeeze through.

Underground Tunnel~
You squeeze and squirm your way through the uncomfortable tunnel for some
time.  You are quite aware of the chilling sensations of cold and slimy
things against your skin.  Eventually you come to an odd juncture.  From
here you can continue south or head west into a tighter crack in the wall. 
Above you, a small crack might allow entrance for the smallest folk and
animals.

The passage narrows some providing an even tighter fit then before. 
Fortunately the rocky terain provides as many easy hand and foot holds as
it does hindrances making the way interesting if not easy.  The air is
moist and the walls covered by a patchwork quilt of multi-hued lichens.

Underground Tunnel~
The tunnel opens out into a small room with two main paths of egress. 
The small cave seems natural enough displaying many of the formations
found in caves.  There is a wide variety of stalagmites and stalagtites
in various stages of growth.  A few are broken however, showing that you
are not the first to have passed this way.

The passage has widened enough to become a comfortable tunnel in which
you can stand upright.  Lichens of various colors live in seperate
patches on the walls.  The tunnel runs generally north and south of here,
but a roughly circular hole in the wall provides an exit to the west as
well.

Bottom of a Deep Lake~
Churning waters and a swirl of bubbles announce the presence of the
lake's source.  Yet, in the maelstrom you are constantly buffeted away
from the opening and into sharp rocks nearby.  As you move away from the
strong flow, the water quickly settles into a comfortable, gentle motion.

down a corridor whose walls are sparingly patched by a rainbow of lichens.

You have arrived at a small cavern with a lived-in look.  Years of use
have broken off and smoothed over any signs of stalactites and
stalagmites.  To one side, you see a small bedding of old rags, straw and
seaweed.  A small chair has been lashed together by strands of twined sea
grasses and rests before a similarly fashioned table.  Two exits present
themselves, one to the east and one roughly south.

waters, the air above suddenly seems more chill.  The sheer-sided lake
continues on to the west.

lake water~
You look down through the watery depths and find that the water is
generally clear until it nearly reaches what seems the bottom.  Near the
lake's depth it appears as if the water becomes suddenly clouded with
lifted silt that settles again a short distance away, as if something
down there were writhing about raising clouds of dirt.  The occasional
bubbles makes its way to the surface out of the commotion.

Mist Shrouded Forest~
Several leafy plants obscure the view of a large, circular lake laying
southeast of here.  Ribbons of mist writhe on the lake's surface like a
pit of vipers awaiting an unwary traveller.  The ribbons slowly work
their way off the lake to join thickening curtain of gray mist
surrounding you.  To the east you can see the beginings of a trail as it
winds away from the lake.

Path in a Mist Shrouded Forest~
Through the mists you can see that you stand on the northern edge of a
large, circular lake.  The warm mist seems rise from the water in
snake-like ribbons, joining the gray curtain around you.  The air here is
very warm.  A simple path leads away from the lake heading north.

In the Woods~
You stand in the midst of a dark forest with no sign of trail or
civilization.  In all directions trees stretch on lazily as if no race
existed to bring border to their ceaseless growth.  Somewhere overhead a
squirrel chitters angrily at your intrusion.

Large ferns seem to thrive this close to the lake, absorbing moisture
from the pooled water as well as the mists.  The snaking mists from the
water's surface slither on the ground here before twining up nearby trees
to join the grayness around you.

You are standing at the eastern edge of a large, circular lake.  Warm air
seems to rise up from the lake, carrying strands of mist to joins the
gray curtain that surrounds you.  Dense vegetation grows right up to the
edge of the lake, some with roots just dipping into it.

You wrestle innumerable plant stalks and twisted ivies out of your way as

thicken where snake-like tendrils meet it as they rise from the waters.

Through broad-leafed vegetation you can make out a large circular lake to
the north.  Ribbons of mist snake their way off the lake and over the
vegetation, writhing slowly in a faint breeze.  On the far side of the
lake, you can make out a trail leading northward, away from the lake.

your body, they bring with them a clammy coldness that send shivers down

The mist envelops you with a sensation just short of being plunged in
water, coating you in pearls of dew.  Light seems to be absorbed by the
thick gray mists, reducing your vision to a scant few feet, turning trees
into monstrous shadows.  To the north, the forest becomes overgrown and
impassible.

forest continues in all directions, however, to the north and west it is
simply too thick to travel through.

Small Field~
Pale, yellow straw and heather proliferate in a small, narrow field
cleared of the mists by unfettered sunlight.  A slight breeze causes the
field's flora to undulate in rhythmic motions.  The field itself is a
large oval shape extending off to the south and is surrounded by tall,
dark trees with rough bark.  Directly north of here, the thick forest
growth lining the field becomes impassable.
