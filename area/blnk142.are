Amidst a Thick Treeline~
Hereabouts the trees are mostly dark-needled pines, with a few scattered
oaks in sight as well.  The dark, thick branches of the massive trees
reach high overhead into a canopy of darkness which nearly shrouds the
forest floor.  To the east the giant stone feet of the Cairn Mountains
await, marking the boundary of a land where man is only a curious
explorer at best.  No man is master of the mountains which have stood as
long as time.

A Worn Path in a Dense Forest~
An old, decaying pine stands off to the side of the path amongst a few
wide-trunked oaks and more pines.  You can travel north or south through
the forest, leave it through the thick trees to a ruined road to the
west, or down a slight slope behind the shagbark to the east toward a
small clearing in the forest.  Aged oaks form a dense edge of trees to
the west, seemingly lining an old road which winds its way northward.

Inside a Hollow Pine~
You stand in the dark, decaying center of a dying shagbark hickory tree. 
Bits of dirt and decayed wood fall in small crumbling showers around you. 
The surface of the decaying wood is covered with moss and lichen, slowly
eating the wood away until eventually the tree will come crashing down to
the forest floor.  That event is still many years away, however.  It
looks like you can either squeeze out of the trunk or up higher into the
hollowing tree.

This dark cranny must be a nest of some sort, as myriad piles of pine
needles and leaves have foudn their way here somehow.  A hole leads down
into the trunk below, which looks rotted out, and you can leave the
cranny to the west, where a large limb branches outward from the tree and

Out on a Limb~
You stand precariously perched on a rotting branch of a once mighty pine
tree.  The branch is not high enough to overlook the mighty forests
around you, but it does give a nice view of the hard ground below. 
Although the drop to the base of the tree is not a short one, you should
be able to manage it without severely damaging yourself.

A Forest of Mighty Pines~
The chill, cool air of the Cairn Mountains wisps through the trunks of
rising pine trees all around, but the fresh air still seems oddly
stifled, as if the four winds have forsaken these woods.  Old trunks
stand to the west, where the air stands still and forgotten amidst the
knees of the mountains.  It appears that past that rugged treeline an old
road winds its way northward.  Although more forest stands visible to the
southeast, a narrow gorge which cuts jaggedly through the forest floor
makes that forestland inaccessable at present.
~

A Burnt Out Clearing~
Some misfortune has claimed the pines in this area, and by the scorched
looks of the ground it was more than likely a lightning strike.  To the
west and south the pine forestry continues, but the edges of a stream can
be seen to the east, and to the north you can see several large stones.

By the Cool Waters of a Mountain Stream~
You stand between a small patch of lightning-struck earth to the west and
a swiftly flowing mountain stream to the east.  Its chill waters flow by
over smooth rocks, sparkling water clear as crystal which flows down from
the metling snowcaps higher up in the mountains.  The terrain is bare
next to the stream's edge, which can either be crossed or followed to
either the north or south.

By the Cool Waters of a Mountain Stream~
A tall slab of stone leading from west to north marks the edge of the
Cairn Mountains, a tiny part of the immense backbone of stone which
crosses the northlands.  A small crack in the stone issues forth a steady
gush of cold water which forms a stream which leads to the south into the
forests south of the mountains.

In the Cool Waters of a Mountain Stream~
You stand in about 3 feet of icy water which pours forth from a crack in
the tall rock slab to the north, marking the edge of the Cairn Mountains. 
The cold hard stones which form the stream's bed are easily visible
through the water's crystal clearness.  You can wade down the wide,
swiftly-flowing stream to the south or climb onto the west bank, but a
jagged outcropping of rock prevents escape from the stream to the east.

In the Cool Waters of a Mountain Stream~
Chill waters rush beneath you, rising no more than 3 feet or so above
smooth rocks which line this shallow, yet wide and strong-flowing stream. 
Rapidly-flowing rapids are visible to the south, and a roar in that
direction suggests that the rapids change quickly into a waterfall.  You
can head upstream to the north or you can climb out of the water to the
or east.

The calm, cold waters which are visible to the north form violent,

a gorge blocks movement to the south the size of the waterfall cannot be

At the Feet of the Cairn Mountains~
Huge slabs of stone which form the edge and base of the Cairn Mountains
lie like towers to the east and north, yet still their mammoth presence
is miniscule in comparison with the mighty girth of the Cairn Mountains. 
It is said that human feet have not yet crossed many miles of the
mountains, and even the dwarves have not explored many of the mountains
peaks.  Still, if you want to explore the untamed might of the Cairn
Mountains, this is not the place for your journey to start, as the sheer
faces of the stones make thoughts of a climb futile ones.

East of a Chill Mountain Stream~
A swiftly-flowing stream flows by to the west, heading for rapids visible
to the south.  Mighty pines stand all around, dark trunks rising into the
chill mountain air.  No paths can be seen, as man has evidently not found
his way this deep into the forest in large numbers.  A few crushed
pinecones announce the passage of someone or something, however.  You can
follow the stream to the north or south, enter it to the west, or head
into the dark pines to the east.

water is so shallow at this point that a jump down into it would probably
result in serious injury.  To the north another tall slab of stone marks
the edge of the Cairn Mountains, an impassable barrier which cannot be

dark-needled branches.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines~
Mighty pines stand around you, a towering vanguard of an older age.  The
air here is chill, even this low in the mountains, as if in the Cairn
Mountains the very bones of the earth are frozen solid, and have in turn
turned the air to ice.  To the north, east, and south you see naught but
more of the pine forest and its green and orange pine needle floor, while
to the west you see only beaten vegetation lining a stream.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines~
Regal, aloof pines stand mightily overhead, thick trunks supporting
complex branchwork which blots out the sky in a sheet of many-needled
branches.  Fresh green, dying orange and dead brown are the colours of
the fallen needles which cover the forest floor here, a soft layer which
disguises the tracks of those who pass.  No beaten paths weave their way
twixt the pines.  From the west you hear the sounds of a rushing stream,
but to the south you see nothing but more pines.

Beside a Violently-Flowing Mountain Stream~
The shallow mountain stream which flows from the north deepens here and
quickens its pace drastically here, forming dangerous rapids with heavy
undercurrents as leaves floating on the surface of the water are
swallowed beneath its crystal surface, reappearing several feet
downstream.  You hear the roar of a waterfall to the southwest as the
stream plummets into the gaping gorge to the south.  A natural terrace
has formed on this side of the ridge, however, forming a stone and earth
staircase which leads down the side of the gorge.  The gorge follows to
the east and west, but a forest of mighty pines appears across it as well
as on this side as to the east the forest approaches the very edge of the
gorge.

A Small Chamber Behind the Waterfall~
This rounded chamber drips with water from a crack in the ceiling, making
the cave-like floor at your feet damp with water.  To the south you can
see a solid sheet of water beyond a narrow ledge, a waterfall majestic to
behold from this vantage.  The roar of the rushing water is loud, and
echos heavily in this chamber, but it is as peaceful and reassuring as
the crashing of the sea despite the intensity of the sound.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines at the Edge of a Gorge~
The mighty girth of the pines of the Cairn Mountains come to an abrupt
end as the earth itself has been ripped apart, forming a gorge which has
split the forest in twain.  Across the gorge to the south you see more
mighty, endless forest, and the same to the north and east.  To the west
you can see through the thick trunks and the odd low-hanging bough the
rippling surface of a rapidly-flowing stream.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines at the Edge of a Gorge~
A jagged gorge to the south separates this section of mighty pine forest
from another across the gorge.  In all other directions the thick,
tower-like trunks of mountain pine grow into the sky.  Fresh green and
dying orange pine needles are scattered all over the ground, not quite a
blanket over the hard, cold ground but nearly so.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines~
In all other directions you can see thick forestry, thick-trunked pines
and other trees scores of years old.  Through a break in the pine
branches you catch a glimpse of craggy peaks to the north.  Through the
tree trunks to the southeast, you can make out what seems to be a wall of
brown, or a very large tree trunk.

Cairn Mountain Forest - Dark Pines~
The pine forest reaches a stone-walled corner here, as huge slabs of rock
jutting upward from the hard ground block movement to the east and north. 
To the south and west you can see more pines and not much else.  High
overhead in the not-so-distant north stands a ridge of craggy peaks, the
Cairn Mountains.

Edge of the Mist~
A wall of dark gray mist and pounding rain blocks movement to the south. 
Dull, dissipated streaks of lightning flash deep within the depths of the
rain, their light scattered to a faint, pallid gray.  To the north stand
huge, dark, rain-soaked trees, and to the east and west the forest
continues, skirting the edge of the misty wall.

To the south is a raging torrent of churning fog and mist, beaten by a
hammer-like deluge of rain.  Angry flashes of lightning swell deep in the
mist, throwing eerie shadows from vague, dark shapes that seem to move
very slowly.  Despite its violence, however, the unearthly storm is
utterly quiet.  To the north, east and west are tall, dark trees, their
leaves glistening with droplets of rain.

In stark contrast to the earthy beauty of the surrounding forest, a
raging wall of storms rises to the south, blocking movement.  The wall
seems to be made of fog and lightning and an incredible, pounding deluge
that blurs all vision.  The storm, however, is utterly silent, the
flashes of lightning dull and diluted as the light dissipates
iridescently in the fog.

Among the Mushrooms~
Thousands of mushrooms form a sort of miniature forest here as they
sprout from the moist, nourishing soil.  The leaves rustle high above,
and you hear, however distantly, the golden sound of a single voice
rising in song.  The forest floor is clear of debris and underbrush, and
shows no sign of a path, as if no foot has stepped here for ages.  Trees
rise in every direction.

Sinkholes in the Forest Floor~
Several small sinkholes mark the earth where the springy soil has been
eroded from below by groundwater.  The holes are far too small to enter,
and appear too shallow to house anything other than a rabbit.  All around
you stand massive trees with long, straight trunks, and their broad green
leaves fan out to form a canopy a hundred feet above the forest floor.

Faint Forest Trail~
A faint path heads through the forest of ancient, mountainous trees.  The

has pulled back to form a kind of leafy avenue that leads into the forest. 
To the south stands a massive boulder, thirty feet high, its surface
sheer and slicked with a layer of water.

sneers and vomits blazing energy, destroying hundreds of pixies at once.

in chains of searing energy.  The remaining pixies swarm over the dragon,

A Grassy Terrace~
This is the exact center of a large, grassy terrance, which lies half-way
up along the steep edge of a tall, rocky hill.  The grass extends in
every direction.  In the distant east unfolds a huge, dark forest, its
treetops swaying.  To the west is a steep incline, heading to the crest
of this large hill, where a mountainous tree stands.  The sound of
singing drifts quietly, carried by a soft, rain-scented breeze.

patches of gray.  Its size seems to intimidate the very earth--the air is
still, the sounds of the forest are no more than a whisper.  A kind of
path moves around the tree to the north and west, while a tiny path heads
toward a patch of grass to the south.  The tree is so enormous, its bark
so thick, that the grooves make near-perfect handholds.

Misty Passage~
A thick, low mist blankets the spongy earth and wraps the large, leafy
trees in glimmering shrouds of white.  A soft wind comes in from the
east, rustling the leaves and stirring the mist into little eddies that
dissipate as soon as they form.  The terrain does not seem quite real -
the sky is a strange, flat, dark blue, somewhere between daylight and
night.  This place is freakishly quiet.  A barely noticeable path,
cloaked in mist, heads toward a massive forest to the west.  To the south
stands a large, rippling sheet of dark liquid, standing out starkly in
the diluted, pale colors that surround it.

mist~
The mist is thick and heavy, clinging to the ground as if attached to it. 
The spiny, fog-wrapped tips of bushes poke up through the mist.  Large,
dark trees stand here, their leaves cloaked in mist as if it were rain.

E
sky~
The sky, like the rest of this place, seems oddly flat.  It lacks depth
or complex shades of color, and actually seems quite low to the ground. 
Although this place is light, none of the trees cast shadows, giving this
part of the forest the further appearance of being two-dimensional.

Atop A Large Hill~
This hill rises high in the forest--nearly to the tops of the trees. 
This is the edge of the forest, which stretches off to the south.  From
this high vantage, you have a perfect view of a valley to the north,
which extends to the horizon in a vast basin of gently rolling,
grass-covered hills, which look almost like rumpled velvet.  The crest of
the hill continues westward, and a slope leads downward to the forest
floor.

Crest of a Large Hill~
You are high enough to touch the leaves of the massive trees to the
south, which soar upward from the forest floor.  The air here is crisp
and invigorating and smells of distant rain.  From this high vantage, you
can see a rolling, hilly basin, which stretches out endlessly to the
north.  However, the basin seems oddly flat and lifeless, as if it were
not real, but an incredibly detailed painting.  The crest of this hill
heads east and west.

Atop a Large Hill~
The hill slopes downward here and rejoins the dark forest floor far below. 
You are high enough to see the forest in its entirety--it extends
southeast for the most part, though there is still much to the southwest. 
Far to the west you see another hill, atop of which is tree so large it
defies imagination.  To the east, a grassy path of sorts leads along this
hill's crest.

In the Pixie Forest~
This is a warm, cozy den beneath the roots of a large tree.  The mud
walls are covered with small, intricate tapestries, the floor is dry and
covered with leaves.  In the center of the floor is a small, wooden table
abutted by a wooden chair.  The air here smells of sweet pipesmoke.  A
hole above is covered with a large pad of moss.

You stand in a formless void.  There is no space here, and no time. 
Mottled, writhing gray extends in all directions.  Though there is no
visible floor here, you can feel a solid mass beneath you, and you know
you can walk here.  The very fabric of space seems to shift here--dark
shapes in the distance suddenly grow quite large, as if nearing you, then
fade away again.  A thunderous, pounding rain courses through the void,
seeming to come from all directions.  Distant bolts of lightning flash,
their light dissipated as if trapped in clouds.  Floating here before her
is a @brift@n of blazing white light--a rip in the very fabric of reality.

their light dissipated as if trapped in clouds.

you can walk here.  The very fabric of space seems to shift here--dark

Inside a Massive Log~
The enormous, hollow log is like a tunnel, although the east end is
jammed up against another tree trunk, blocking that way.  Tiny droplets
of water drip in through cracks in the ancient, time-eaten wood.  The
interior is covered with moss, and dark water congeals on the floor.
