Decrepit Mine Entrance~
You are standing in the entrance of a decrepit old mine.  The walls are
roughly cut and thick black tar seeps in the many cracks.  The wooden
struts holding back the ceiling are rotted and falling apart.  From time
to time, you can hear strange noises coming from deep within the mine. 
The tunnel continues downward to the east, or you can exit the mine by
heading west.

Decrepit Mine Tunnel~
The walls of the tunnel are roughly cut and thick black tar seeps in the
many cracks.  The wooden struts holding back the ceiling are rotted and
falling apart.  There is a noticably large crack in the ceiling here. 
The tunnel continues to the east and west.

Decrepit Mine Tunnel~
A wide tunnel stretches into the darkness, allowing you to move freely in
any direction but south.  Broken cobwebs barely attached to the walls
indicate that someone - or something - has passed this way recently.  To
the south, bits of rotting timber have been carelessly hammered together,
forming a small wooden shed.

Tiny Wooden Shed~
There are storage bins and cabinets all along the walls of this small
shed.  The walls are made of wood, but have been covered with brown clay. 
Here and there, patches of the clay have worn off, exposing the rotted
wood underneath.  Mining equipment can be found scattered about the room.

Decrepit Mine Tunnel~
Jagged wooden struts hold the low mine ceiling in place, making it
difficult if not dangerous to move along this east-west shaft.  Water has
formed in several small pools, but there is no visible source for the
fluid.  There is no breeze at all: the water is completely still and
very, very cold.

Decrepit Mine Tunnel~
A small pile of broken rocks lies on the ground near the eastern wall of
this portion of the tunnel.  Each rock is almost identical in shape and
color, and does not seem to have fallen from the nearby stones. 
Conversely, the ground under the western wall is quite clean.

This portion of the tunnel is dominated by a rectangular-looking shaft
which leads down deep into the heart of the mine.  There appear to be two
ways down: a small lift as well as some rusted iron rungs attached to the
east wall of the shaft.  A single rope for operating the lift is attached
to a pulley on the ceiling.

Decrepit Mine Tunnel Vent~
This narrow passage barely allows you to move from east to west.  The
rock of the walls and ceiling is not timbered here, and rockslides appear
all too probable; in fact, the dirt on the northern wall is especially
loose.  Looking east and west you can see where it opens into the tunnels
beyond.

A pair of iron tracks runs along the center of the tunnel, metal shining
in the light cast by the numerous torches affixed to the rough walls. 
The tunnel seems to stretch endlessly to the north and south, and there

deeper into the maze of corridors.

It is very cold and dry in this narrow tunnel.  To the east you can see
the faint light of a large corridor; it is far too dark to the west to
see what lies in that direction.  The rough walls have been crudely cut,
as if by giant hammers or picks.

air in the rest of the tunnel seem frigid in comparison.  Despite the
fact that the logs are burning brightly, the fire never seems to diminish.

[Nereus] There's a campfire underground in an enclosed mine, which causes

Golem Construction Area~
You are greeted by the harsh crack of a whip and the agonized groans of
several slaves working to lift a large chunk of heavy dark rock at least
30 feet in the air...  with only one pulley.  The smell of sweat and
blood here nearly makes you gag, and you find it hard to believe anyone
can ever work under these conditions.  There is a huge unfinished golem
here, surrounded by scaffolding and ropes.  He appears to be made out of
Krynite, and you feel slightly queasy at the thought of having to face a
monster of that size and type.

necrophelia techniques modern practitioners~
You open the book and read:
    
"Acquisition of corpses may or may not be a difficult chore for
necropheliacs.  In some smaller towns where few deaths occur, it may be
possible to persuade the local graveyard officials to give over any
corpses they may have awaiting burial.  These officials make only a
pittance from the performance of their duties, and most will gladly take
your gold to augment this meagre income.  Another option is to find a
person who is pleasing to your appetites and kill him or her yourself,
and some procedures for this are outlined for you in Chapter 28." 
~
E
their pain your pleasure~
You open the book and read:
  
"Perhaps the most common misconception amongst the sadists is that
inflicting pain upon a victim drains the torturer of his emotions.  This
is simply not true.  Great emotion can be experienced by the torturer,
leading him to ecstasies and fantastic pleasures.  To give mercy to our
victim is to forfeit delights that are unknown to the weaker beings of
compassionate nature." 
~
E
titles books~
You tilt your head sideways and scan the titles of the books closest to
you.  You see books on anatomy and mathematics, as well as titles such as
"Their Pain for Your Pleasure" and "Necrophilia Techniques for Modern
Practitioners." These titles catch your interest and you would like to
look at them more.

The dim light from the next room filters in, ennabling you to see only a
little of this room.  Bare walls of light-colored wooden planks run from
floor to ceiling and you see darkly-stained wood flooring.  You can see
where shelving once hung, leaving nail holes with the sides chipped.  It
looks like the shelves were ripped out in a hurry and by someone who is

Sturdier than you first expected, this lift was constructed to carry ore
up and down the mining shaft.  The wooden planks forming the bottom of
the lift are covered with detritus and scuff marks.  Outside the lift but

Beyond the Great Iron Door~
This wide tunnel burrows its twisting way through solid rock.  The drab
brownish-grey rock of the mines is shot through in various places with
veins of pure white quartz.  The floor of the tunnel is littered with
jagged pieces of stone, most likely hewn out of the tunnel walls.  The
ceiling of the tunnel is relatively high, just a touch higher than a tall
ogre could reach.  Set into the eastern wall is a massive door of pitted
iron.

New Mine Tunnel~
This tunnel has been roughly hewn out of the brownish-grey stone.  All
along the walls and ceiling, the rock has been gouged and hewn away
inexpertly, shattering the stone around it.  Small slivers of quartz
litter the floor, along with larger chunks of brown rock.  Along the
western wall of the chamber, a vein of violet ore spreads its spidery
lines through the pure white of a large quartz deposit, mingling violet
and alabaster in a lovely, random pattern through the dull brown rock.

The western wall is a perfect example of nature's beauty.  A deposit of
the purest white quartz dominates the wall, while spidery veins of violet
ore sprawl through it in a random pattern of lines.  The pale
bluish-purple ore fades in and out of the quartz before fading away
entirely near the south end of the wall.

New Mine Tunnel~
The monotony of the drab, greyish brown stone is broken along the western
wall by a brilliant blaze of white quartz threaded through with a few
gossamer strands of violet ore.  A large hole has been gouged out of the
lovely quartz.  All around the three foot wide hole, white quartz has
been marred and shattered by the clumsy excavation.  The floor of this
section of the mine is curiously mounded up with a myriad of rock shards,
chunks of quartz, and just plain dirt.
